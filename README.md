=========

The OTW-Archive software is an open-source web application intended for hosting archives
of fanworks, including fanfic, fanart, and fan vids. 

Its development is sponsored by
the [Organization for Transformative Works](http://transformativeworks.org), a nonprofit
organization by and for fans.

Release Status
---------

The OTW-Archive software is still in beta and has not yet been formally released, but you
can see it in action on the [Archive of Our Own](http://archiveofourown.org), aka AO3, a
multifandom archive also run by the OTW.

Our ultimate goal is to release OTW-Archive in a form that can be installed and used by
any fan archivist interested in creating and maintaining a fanwork archive.

You can get more information about
our broad development plan at the [OTW-Archive Roadmap](http://transformativeworks.org/projects/archive).
