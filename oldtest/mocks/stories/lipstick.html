<p>Summary: He's covered in a thin coat of grime, like a coal miner, or a TV orphan. Written for the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/ds_flashfiction/">ds_flashfiction</a> dirty, dirty challenge.</p>

<p>Acknowledgements: Thanks must be given to Shana, who helped even though she had to ask which one was the Canadian, and to Laura, who already knew.</p>

<b>The Lipstick Mafia</b>

<p><br>
I open the door and my mind is blown, just POW, oatmeal, 'cause on the other side's Fraser, and he's all crumpled and rumpled and, who knew it was even possible, dirty. Dirty like he'd been dragged behind a bus, or caught in a bar fight, thrown in a dumpster, and then dragged behind a bus. Whatever he was wearing before, he's only got half of it left, white t-shirt with a ripped sleeve, a pair of jeans and-- </p>

<p>REDACTED</p>

<p>And that's how the lipstick mafia got me and Fraser in the shower.</p>
