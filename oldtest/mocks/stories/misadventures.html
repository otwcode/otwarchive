<b>Madrigals and Misadventures</b><br>

It was really cool at Lord Cowell's estate&mdash;at least, the place was cool. There was so much space, all these big fancy ballrooms with high ceilings and shiny wood floors with rugs that David was sort of scared to get dirty, so he usually ended up walking all the way around the edges if no one else was watching him. The pipes were spelled so you could get hot water just by turning a spigot, and the cooks were really nice and always gave you a snack even if it was late. David had a big bedroom all his own, with a window that looked out over the stables and the green hills of the paddocks, all the way down to the river. He was kind of nervous about getting too close to the horses in person, because those things were <i>huge</i>, gosh, as big as sedan chairs, but they looked really pretty running around in the fields.</p>

<p>"I swear that was Ryan's idea," Cook said, after a moment.</p>

<p>"I so don't believe you," David said.</p>
