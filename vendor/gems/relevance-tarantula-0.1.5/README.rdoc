= Tarantula

== DESCRIPTION

Tarantula is a big fuzzy spider. It crawls your Rails application, fuzzing data to see what breaks.

== Usage

=== Installation

The latest and greatest version is always available on GitHub. (See the rakefile for dependencies, or
just let Rubygems handle it.)

    gem install relevance-tarantula --source http://gems.github.com

You can also grab it from RubyForge, where we will push stable releases but may not be as bleeding edge
as the GitHub gem.

    gem install tarantula

=== Project Setup

To set up Tarantula into your application, add the following line into either config/environment.rb or
config/environments/test.rb (preferred). This assumes that you have Rails 2.1 or higher installed.

    config.gem 'relevance-tarantula', :source => "http://gems.github.com", :lib => 'relevance/tarantula'

Since Rails doesn't (yet) support automatically loading rake tasks that live inside gems, you will need
to update your Rakefile to load Tarantula's rake tasks. The simplest approach is to start by vendoring 
Tarantula into your Rails app.

    mkdir -p vendor/gems
    cd vendor/gems
    gem unpack relevance-tarantula

You can then add the following line into your Rakefile, which will allow your application to discover 
Tarantula's rake tasks.

  load File.join(RAILS_ROOT, Dir["vendor/gems/relevance-tarantula-*/tasks/*.rake"])

=== Crawling Your App

Use the included rake task to create a Rails integration test that will allow Tarantula to crawl your
app.

   #!sh
   rake tarantula:setup

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the generated test. If parts of your application require
login, update the test to make sure Tarantula can access those parts of your app.

   require "relevance/tarantula"
   
   class TarantulaTest < ActionController::IntegrationTest
     # Load enough test data to ensure that there's a link to every page in your
     # application. Doing so allows Tarantula to follow those links and crawl 
     # every page.  For many applications, you can load a decent data set by
     # loading all fixtures.
     fixtures :all
   
     def test_tarantula
       # If your application requires users to log in before accessing certain 
       # pages, uncomment the lines below and update them to allow this test to
       # log in to your application.  Doing so allows Tarantula to crawl the 
       # pages that are only accessible to logged-in users.
       # 
       #   post '/session', :login => 'quentin', :password => 'monkey'
       #   follow_redirect!
       
       tarantula_crawl(self)
     end
   end

If you want to set custom options, you can get access to the crawler and set properties before running
it. For example, this would turn on HTMLTidy.

   def test_tarantula
     post '/session', :login => 'kilgore', :password => 'trout'
     assert_response :redirect
     assert_redirected_to '/'
     follow_redirect!

     t = tarantula_crawler(self)
     t.handlers << Relevance::Tarantula::TidyHandler.new
     t.crawl '/'
   end

Now it's time to turn Tarantula loose on your app. Assuming your project is at /work/project/:

   #!sh
   cd /work/project
   rake tarantula:test

== Verbose Mode

If you run the test using the steps shown above, Tarantula will produce a report in tmp/tarantula. You
can also set VERBOSE=true to see more detail as the test runs.

For more options, please see the test suite.

== Allowed Errors

If, for example, a 404 is an appropriate response for some URLs, you can tell Tarantula to allow 404s
for URLs matching a given regex:

     t = tarantula_crawler(self)
     t.allow_404_for %r{/users/\d+/}

== Custom Attack Handlers

You can specify the attack strings that Tarantula throws at your application.

    def test_tarantula
      t = tarantula_crawler(self)

      Relevance::Tarantula::AttackFormSubmission.attacks << { 
        :name => :xss,
        :input => "<script>gotcha!</script>",
        :output => "<script>gotcha!</script>",
      }

      Relevance::Tarantula::AttackFormSubmission.attacks << { 
        :name => :sql_injection,
        :input => "a'; DROP TABLE posts;",
      }

      t.handlers << Relevance::Tarantula::AttackHandler.new
      t.fuzzers << Relevance::Tarantula::AttackFormSubmission
      t.times_to_crawl = 2
      t.crawl "/posts"
    end

This example adds custom attacks for both SQL injection and XSS. It also tells Tarantula to crawl the
app 2 times. This is important for XSS attacks because the results won't appear until the second time
Tarantula performs the crawl.
