= PiwikAnalytics

 This plugin enables support for Piwik in your Rails application. By default
it will output the synchronous piwik tracking code for every page automatically
(given that it is configured correctly). Configuring this plugin is easy:

    PiwikAnalytics::Config.id_site = <Site ID>
    PiwikAnalytics::Config.url = <Piwik-URL>

Where the <Site ID> the ID of your website inside Piwik. You can look it up
under Settings -> Websites. <Piwik-URL> must be replaced by the URL to your
Piwik installation.

If you want PiwikAnalytics to use the asynchronous tracking code which was
introduced in Piwik 1.1 you can add the folliwing line:

    PiwikAnalytics::Config.use_async = true

If you want to disable the tracking code for particular controllers simply add
the following line to those controllers:

    skip_after_filter :add_piwik_analytics_tracking

Enjoy :)
