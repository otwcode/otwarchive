# Contributing to OTW-Archive

## Reporting bugs

We maintain a [Jira issue tracker](https://otwarchive.atlassian.net/projects/AO3/issues) for developers,
and a [list of Known Issues](https://archiveofourown.org/known_issues) for
[Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org) users, neither of which are
publicly editable.

If you need help using the site, or want to report an issue you have found,
please [contact the AO3 Support team](https://archiveofourown.org/support). Our Support team is staffed by volunteers, so please wait for a response before submitting another ticket. Duplicate submissions will not make things happen faster.


## Reporting security issues

Please refer to [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/blob/master/SECURITY.md).


## Updating documentation

Our [development wiki](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/wiki) is publicly
editable. Unless a page says at the top that it should only be edited by
official OTW volunteers, please feel free to make changes!


## Suggesting new features

Please [contact the AO3 Support team](https://archiveofourown.org/support). Our Support team is staffed by volunteers, so please wait for a response before submitting another ticket. Duplicate submissions will not make things happen faster.


## Contributing code

**We only accept pull requests for issues we have already added to [Jira](https://otwarchive.atlassian.net)**,
with the exception of spelling corrections and documentation improvements
(e.g. any Markdown files). We also do not accept code generated by AI tools; for more information,
please refer to [our commit policy](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/wiki/Commit-Policy#scary-legal-stuff).

Please check out our development wiki for more information on:

- [how to set up a development environment](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/wiki)
- [code conventions](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/wiki/Commit-policy)

### Workflow

1. If you're a new contributor, find a task on the [issues reserved for first timers](https://otwarchive.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=13119). Otherwise, or if you're up for a challenge, pick a task from the general [open and unassigned issues](https://otwarchive.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10800). (If you're a new contributor, don't worry about claiming the issue for now. If you make a Jira account, you'll get permissions for claiming issues in step 5.)
2. Write code to address the issue.
3. Optional: Create a Jira account if you'd like the ability to comment on, assign, and transition issues. Please make sure the Full Name on your Jira account either closely matches the name you'd like us to credit in the release notes or includes it in parentheses, e.g. "Nickname (CREDIT NAME)."
4. Submit the code with a pull request following the checklist on [our template](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
5. Once you've submitted a pull request, we'll review your code and give you permissions on Jira. Please be patient with us! Due to our workload, it may take some time before we can review and eventually merge your pull request.
6. Once your pull request is merged, we will deploy it to our internal testing site and our QA team will check that everything is working as intended.
7. If something is not working as intended, we may set the issue to ["Broken on Test"](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/wiki/Issue-Tracking-with-Jira) and ask you to make further changes in new pull requests.
8. If all is well, your contribution will be deployed to the [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org) and you will be credited in the [release notes](https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts?tag=1)!
