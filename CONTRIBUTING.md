# Contributing to Archive of Our Own

## Contributing code

### Pick an issue to work on

You will find our [list of approved issues on JIRA](https://otwarchive.atlassian.net/projects/AO3/issues).

We regret that we cannot accept pull requests for issues we haven't already logged, with the exception of documentation 
or spelling corrections. 

### Resolve the issue

Consult our [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/wiki) on how to set up a local development 
environment so you can work on the Archive code.

### Submit your pull request

Please read the checklist on [our pull request template](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
for the steps you need to perform to make sure we can accept your pull request.

### Action comments on your pull request

When we review your pull request, we will make comments on GitHub. Please make sure you read these carefully and apply
their suggestions!

Due to our workload, it may take several weeks before an approved pull request is merged, so be patient - we will get to it!

### Testing and fixing bugs

Once your pull request is merged, it will be deployed to our internal Staging server and our manual QA team will check it.
We may ask you to make further changes and submit a new pull request if we find any problems that will affect our users'
ability to benefit from your changes. 

### Release

Once we have checked that all is well, your contribution will be deployed to [Archive of Our Own](http://archiveofourown.org) and you will be credited
in the [AO3 Release Notes](http://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts?tag=1)! Make sure you tell us your preferred name and pronoun
in the pull request.
