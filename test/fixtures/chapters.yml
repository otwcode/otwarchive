    Section 35: Negotiations<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Hey, guys!" John called out cheerfully. "What do we have here? A moving out party? And no one invited us?" To their credit, the soldiers didn't flinch but kept their weapons trained on them. One of them licked his lips nervously. "Drop your guns," said John. None of them moved.</p>
    <p>"Now!" shouted Aeryn from one knee behind the corner, punctuating her command with a warning shot that sparked nervous glances and cessation of voices from the infirmary.</p>
    <p>"Hey, you like this guy or not?" John demanded as another young face popped up behind those between him and the door. "'Cause I ain't holdin' a candy bar here."</p>
    <p>"Release Dr. Jackson, you have nowhere to go!" one of the Marines shouted.</p>
    <p>"Fine, you want to call my bluff?" John shot the floor at Daniel's feet, making the soldiers jump. Beneath his fingers, he felt Daniel go rigid. "I can take him apart piece by piece. Now move out of my way."</p>
    <p>By now they had a captive audience just inside the infirmary door. "Airman," said Jack softly and calmly. "Let him in." The soldiers shot worried looks at each other before obeying and opening a path into the infirmary.</p>
    <p>"Ah, ah, bulldogs first," John prompted them before him. He didn't want any guns at his back even if he did have a hostage. Aeryn followed covering his back with the casual air of one who knows her business. Once inside, the soldiers arrayed themselves by the door. The nurses and medics retreated to the right with Dr. Frasier in front nervously eyeing Winona at Daniel's throat. John hated it too but what choice did they have now? He glanced over General Hammond and the General that wanted D'argo, the latter looking angry and confused.</p>
    <p>"What is this? Who are you?" the stranger demanded.</p>
    <p>John ignored him and regretfully met Jack's hurt gaze. "Sorry," he said. "It's easier when I take myself hostage, but I don't think you really care about me right now."</p>
    <p>"John, what are you doing?" asked Jack still calm though his eyes flickered to Daniel.</p>
    <p>"Jack, Jack, Jack," John shook his head. "You don't get D'argo. It's as simple as that."</p>
    <p>"Let Daniel go, John. You don't want to do this."</p>
    <p>John let loose a snort of laughter that held anything but mirth. "You're right Jack, I don't want to do this. But your General Dracula here wants to tear my best friend apart in the name of science. You tell me what I should do."</p>
    <p>"We still have your friend in our custody," said the General. "And you are still in the most heavily guarded base on Earth. You'll never get out of here alive."</p>
    <p>The sudden sound of pulse fire ripped through the room. With a cry of pain, the interloping General fell to his knees, his right thigh scorched.</p>
    <p>Aeryn glared at him over her pulse pistol that was still trained on him. Five guns snapped up in response. "Maybe you won't get out of here alive," she said coldly. "Now give us D'argo and let us go. I'm sick of talking."  The stillness of the room broke into controlled pandemonium as Dr. Frasier rushed to help the wounded man and a dozen people started shouting orders, chief among them General Hammond.</p>
    <p>"Quiet!" he bellowed above the others and quiet is what he got. The portly General surveyed the scene around him. "Doctor?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"He's losing blood but he'll be fine," the doctor reported brusquely, signaling her medical staff to help her get her new patient up and into a bed.</p>
    <p>That settled the General turned his eye to Aeryn and John who glared back just as stubbornly. "Airmen, stand down," he said.</p>
    <p>"Sir?"</p>
    <p>"I said stand down, airmen," Hammond repeated in a tone that brooked no disobedience. The soldiers lowered their weapons warily.</p>
    <p>"But, sir - "</p>
    <p>"Dr. Rhodes, do not even think about questioning my orders," the General snapped at the man who had spoken. Behind him, Jack was grinning from ear to ear. Watching the scene unfold in its complete reversal made John sigh in relief. His grip on Daniel, while never deadly, nevertheless relaxed. "We have a hostage situation here and General Forge has been shot. I see little choice but to let these people go as they request."</p>
    <p>"I can shoot him too if you want," offered Aeryn. John glanced at her sharply, but saw the light dancing behind her eyes, though from the shuffling of the soldiers, they did not.</p>
    <p>"Ms. Sun, let's get one thing straight here," the General took a step forward radiating anger. "I may be sympathetic to your situation but I will not condone the shooting of anyone on this base." Aeryn matched him stare for stare.</p>
    <p>"You're still standing between me and D'argo," she said quietly.</p>
    <p>"And I'm not moving until Mr. Crichton releases Dr. Jackson," Hammond replied. "I give you my word that you will be allowed to leave here unhindered. I assure you that nothing will lose my goodwill more quickly than holding my people at gunpoint."</p>
    <p>"Jack?"</p>
    <p>"His word's good, Aeryn," said Jack with a nod at Hammond.</p>
    <p>Aeryn slowly lowered her gun. "Alright. But we're not disarming."</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid I can't allow that," said Hammond. "I need a guarantee that my people will be safe."</p>
    <p>"Jack can have them," John spoke up. The others turned their attention from Aeryn to him. He let go of Daniel's collar and offered him Winona, butt first. Daniel looked first at the gun, then at John with sad eyes. "Sorry about all this," John looked away, ashamed for treating a good man badly. When he met his eyes again though he held them and said, "But I'd do it again." Daniel blinked then nodded, taking Winona and retreating to Jack's side.</p>
    <p>"Thank you," said General Hammond. "As soon as Dr. Frasier clears Mr. D'argo for gate travel, you may leave anytime you wish. I'm afraid I'll have to keep you under guard. Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Dendron, if I might see you in my office." With a sharp glance at Jack, the General left and the infirmary cleared out of extraneous people leaving John and Aeryn under the wary watch of SG-1 and the five Marines.</p>
    <p>"That was your back-up plan?" Daniel quietly broke the uncomfortable silence.</p>
    <p>John shrugged, a mixture of embarrassed and defiant. "Yeah. More or less. Worked pretty well actually." He was thankful for that at least. Damn, he was tired. The adrenaline rush of the past ten minutes was draining away leaving him feeling like he'd just run a marathon.</p>
    <p>"Some plan," said Jack.</p>
    <p>"Well, yours didn't work."</p>
    <p>"But did you have to take Daniel hostage?" Jack's eyes flashed dangerously and another stab of guilt washed through John. He glanced at Aeryn but she still held rigid control over her features.</p>
    <p>"Jack."</p>
    <p>"Daniel. He held a gun to your head."</p>
    <p>"I wouldn't have hurt him," John broke the staring contest impatiently.</p>
    <p>"You were bluffing?" Jack sounded like he didn't quite believe him. John nodded anyway. "And what if we'd called your bluff?"</p>
    <p>"I would have killed that General," said Aeryn. The men just looked at her. Without another word, she stepped around the humans to get to D'argo's bed. With a last nod, John followed.</p>

    Section 6: Awakenings<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Pain. Pain everywhere. And darkness. Those were the first thoughts that accompanied Chiana back to the land of the living. Too tired and too hurt to try and open her eyes, the Nebari lay still. The surface beneath her was lukewarm and vibrating, a familiar rumble edging into her awareness. Lo'la. She was on D'argo's ship, safe. Memories of the few days they had spent on the Qujagan homeworld filtered back, a myriad of smells, sounds, and textures. No images. The violence of the last day echoed on her skin only to be resolutely pushed away to that dark corner of her mind where she kept the dren that happened in life. There was nothing to be done about it now. Time to move on again.</p>
    <p>If only the pain would go away for a moment. Chiana knew it wouldn't though. Just as she knew that what had happened wouldn't disappear. But for now she just wanted to lie to herself. So she did.</p>
    <p>Above her, voices floated softly in the air. Not hard or dangerous, but unfamiliar, she realized with a start. Panic hit her and she opened her eyes trying desperately to see but seeing nothing. Still blind - strangers - D'argo's ship, she knew it was his, she could feel it. Where was D'argo?!</p>
    <p>"Hey there. Hey, it's okay. We're not going to hurt you," one of the voices, the one closest to her said gently. She could feel his breath and it was not reassuring! Chiana struggled to raise her arm to defend herself, hit him, anything, but her arms felt like fire and her eyes like ice.</p>
    <p>"D'arg - " she whispered hoarsely, igniting another flame down her throat, into her chest where it spread like a fuel leak. It hurt so badly!</p>
    <p>"We're not going to hurt you," the voice repeated.</p>
    <p>"I think she's panicking, Daniel," another male voice told the first one. "Better call tentacles over."</p>
    <p>"D'argo," the first voice called out. Chiana didn't hear what he said next, she only heard her lover's name and a moment later felt his fingers running down her face.</p>
    <p>"D'argo?" she tried again, managing more than a croak. "That you?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah, it's me," the Luxan's deep, soft voice rumbled. Chiana smiled in relief.</p>
    <p>"We're in Lo'la?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"Yes. You're on the floor across from the door."</p>
    <p>"And . . . and them?" The voices, three - four of them that hovered above her.</p>
    <p>"Some humans that we picked up. They found you in a junkyard." Chiana nodded as best she could. She remembered a junkyard nearby. "They're going to help us get John and Aeryn."</p>
    <p>"How did they get here?"</p>
    <p>"No idea."</p>
    <p>Weird. She would think about the humans and their presence here later. "Moya?" she asked next.</p>
    <p>"Almost there," said D'argo. Again his hand passed over her face, and then she felt his lips brush her forehead. "We're going to enter the atmosphere soon. The human next to you is Daniel. He carried you from the junkyard. He'll be the only one touching you." Chiana could feel the glare D'argo was directing at the others. "I'll be back soon. I gotta land us."</p>
    <p>"Okay. Right." Chiana didn't want him to go even the short distance to the cockpit. In the dark it felt like a system away.</p>
    <p>"Chiana?"</p>
    <p>"Frogface!" Rygel was there too. His presence was just as reassuring as D'argo's had been.</p>
    <p>"You look terrible," the Hynerian informed her, but Chiana heard through it. She wanted to laugh but couldn't.</p>
    <p>"I feel terrible," she replied, the weak smile she had conjured earlier fading into a grimace. "So more humans?" she said to distract herself.</p>
    <p>"There are four of them," said Rygel. "They say they've never heard of us." He proceeded then to tell her briefly of their meeting and she was introduced to them. They added commentary when necessary. The one called Major Carter tried to explain how this thing called a stargate worked on planets but the Colonel O'Neill interrupted with a sarcastic, "Carter, I don't even understand what you're talking about. English please." That was when Chiana noticed that Rygel had been speaking John's language while she had continued on in her own tongue.</p>
    <p>Before she could utter her own greeting in the Earth language, D'argo was talking to Pilot, and they were touching down in Moya's hangar.</p>
    <p>***********************************************************************</p>
    <p>Naked and cold, John sat up. Naked he could understand. Well, he could if he were on Moya and not freezing his ass off in this room. Unpainted walls, no furniture, no carpet . . . it would really suck to live here, he thought absently. Of course, there he was. Glancing around, he saw another figure lying on the floor nearby; it was Aeryn, as naked as he was. And while that was a pleasing thought in most situations, this was not one of them.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn," he scuttled over and gently shook her shoulder. "Aeryn, honey, wake up." He shook her shoulder again with no response. Then he grinned at a sudden thought. What the hell, he thought, she'd said yes.</p>
    <p>John leaned over and planted a gentle kiss on Aeryn's lips.</p>
    <p>Still no response. Sighing, John went back to shaking her shoulder. "Aeryn, wake up. Come on, baby, we're in trouble. Again," he added as an afterthought. Finally, a gentle groan and the fluttering of her eyelids heralded her return to consciousness.</p>
    <p>"John?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah, I'm here."</p>
    <p>"You're naked."</p>
    <p>"So are you," he grinned as Aeryn's eyes widened and she sat up, trying to cover herself. After a moment, she glanced around at the room with an annoyed grimace for him and stopped.</p>
    <p>"Do you know where we are?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"Nope, just woke up myself. I remember a ship coming out of nowhere, kissing you, then a shattering sensation. That's it."</p>
    <p>Aeryn nodded. "Me too." She looked around the room again. "I suppose they are watching us," she commented. John shrugged, not seeing any obvious surveillance equipment. They helped each other to their feet slowly to stretch out abused muscles and wandered over to the door. It was solid metal, like the walls, with no door-handle or hinges on the inside. John could barely get a fingernail in the crack between the door and the doorframe. "Frelling solid," muttered Aeryn, turning to him in disgust.</p>
    <p>"Guess we'll have to wait till someone comes a' callin'," said John. He ran a critical eye over his love. "Are you okay?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn nodded again once. "Yes. A little sore, cold. But I'm fine. No real pain so I think the baby is alright." John pulled her close, sensing the worry in her voice. He ran his hands down her arms and back to warm her up.</p>
    <p>"So," John nuzzled into her hair, "since we're stuck here for the moment, you want to set a date?"</p>
    <p>"For the wedding?"</p>
    <p>"Mmmhun,"</p>
    <p>"How about after we get out of here and before we get shot at or captured again," Aeryn suggested with a wry grin. "Although with our luck, we'll probably be shot at and captured at our wedding."</p>
    <p>"Winona can be your Matron of Honor," said John. "Of course, we'll need to find her first."</p>
    <p>"We'll pick her up on the way out," Aeryn murmured reassuringly.</p>
    <p>They lapsed into silence then, both knowing that was wishful thinking. After all, how often did things go to plan? But neither said anything to break the illusion of control. Because maybe, just maybe things would go right. The only thing that was certain was that they only had now.</p>

    'I hope we'll see you at this year's Dance Marathon,' Taylor says, cheerfully officious as usual.
    
    'I'm not sure...' Rory begins, feeling herself flush red. She hasn't been for years, not since that one disastrous night, and she'd rather not be reminded of that now.
    
    'Rory, I thought we could rely on <em>you</em> to uphold the town's traditions.' Taylor draws himself up, ready to deliver a lecture.
    
    Dean cuts him off. 'Of course we'll be there. We're gonna win, right, Rory?'
    
    'Right,' she agrees, and slips her hand into his.
    
    After all, he's already outlasted everyone else.

    Section 7: Moya<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Daniel helped D'argo settle the blind girl in his arms. The poor thing winced and hissed in pain when the two men jostled her fragile body. Daniel felt one of her wounds begin to bleed again through the bandage and silently cursed those that had done this to her. She seemed so young and innocent, though he did notice that she kept herself from crying out as D'argo held her.</p>
    <p>A quick glance out the front window, told Daniel they were completely inside the other ship now. From what he'd seen as they had landed, the larger ship was on another planet in the middle of an ocean. The only question was what kind of ship, for water or for space. He'd thought they meant a space ship, but since they were in the water . . . Daniel would ask when he got the chance.</p>
    <p>"So are you in charge of this boat too?" asked Jack after D'argo spoke the words to open the door. The alien glanced at him and said, "yes," before heading down the steps.</p>
    <p>With a shrug to his team and another subtle look that told them to be ready for anything, Jack followed their hosts through the doors into what looked like a workroom and hangar combined. Large and airy, the golden walls curved ovoidly to the floor, a soft light emanating from behind rib-like supports that left much of the room in shadow. Two other space ships were to the right. The smaller one was too far away for Daniel to get a good look at because it was hidden by the other ship that was clearly a fighter, black and sleek.</p>
    <p>"Would you look at that?" Sam breathed reverently. The pilot in her was clearly impressed. Even Daniel could appreciate the aerodynamic design that would fly efficiently in both space and atmosphere.</p>
    <p>"Carter," Jack reprimanded her gently even as he gave the vessel a lingering look before ushering the team after their hosts.</p>
    <p>The arrival of two other aliens, however, quickly diverted both theirs and Daniel's attention. The "insane" ones, Rygel had called them. Daniel watched with interest, surprised that they were of different species, both of each other and of D'argo and Rygel. The first was an old woman who looked like a human - with an extra eye in her forehead that glowed blue.</p>
    <p>"Hello, humans," she said briskly in English before focusing on Chiana and reverting back to her native language. Clearly, she was the healer of the group; Daniel noticed her going through a cloth bag, as she hurried D'argo and his burden out of the room. She looked more competent than insane.</p>
    <p>The second newcomer, on the other hand, was a little off. He was probably from human descent, Daniel thought. One half of his face was covered by a bronze mask. The man hung back from the others, bouncing slightly on his feet and talking to himself. As D'argo and the old woman walked by, he reached out a hand to Chiana only to snatch it back again before following them in a shuffling gait.</p>
    <p>"So," said Jack, turning to Rygel with an expectant look. "Do we get lemonade?"</p>
    <p>"We don't have lemons and we're out of sugar," the small alien answered briefly.</p>
    <p>"Oh?" said Jack, surprised with the answer.</p>
    <p>"Follow me," Rygel sighed. "I'll show you your quarters." He turned slowly in his floating chair and headed for the door.</p>
    <p>Not wanting to pass up the opportunity, Daniel fell into step beside him as they ventured down the golden hallway. "Nice ship," he commented to break the ice. He noted that the spaces between the ribs could be used for cover. "Is it for space travel?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. She's a Leviathan."</p>
    <p>"So why are we in the middle of an ocean?" asked Jack with his usual directness.</p>
    <p>"The water has minerals that are helping her and Pilot heal from being disconnected," Rygel said without looking at him.</p>
    <p>"Disconnected?" Sam jumped into the conversation. "Your pilot has an interface with the ship?"</p>
    <p>"Of course he does!" Rygel snapped, stopping to look at them in surprise. After a moment his look softened into resignation. "But then you're humans. You don't know anything."</p>
    <p>Both Jack and Sam bristled, Teal'c raised an eyebrow. Daniel was about to say something about how they were not as stupid as they appeared, but Rygel went on before he got a chance.</p>
    <p>"Moya is a biomechanoid. She and Pilot are symbiotes."</p>
    <p>"Are you saying the ship is alive?" asked Carter. When Rygel nodded her eyes widened in wonder. Daniel felt his own surprise as he looked at the hallway around them. They really were ribs. Amazing! In all their travels, he had never seen anything like this.</p>
    <p>"Can she feel us? See? Hear?" he asked, suddenly self-conscious. "Does she mind carrying us?"</p>
    <p>"What about her systems? Biomechanoid, does that mean that some of the systems are biologic and some mechanical, or that it's a blend of both? Do you know how she was made?"</p>
    <p>Rygel shrugged and continued down the hall, taking the left branch at the next junction. "She was born, I think," he said, ignoring the other questions.</p>
    <p>"Born?" Jack glanced at Daniel with the same surprise the archeologist himself felt.</p>
    <p>"Who could I talk to onboard who would know?" Sam asked, refusing to give up on this new wealth of information.</p>
    <p>"Pilot, but he might not want to talk," Rygel answered. "Aeryn might know."</p>
    <p>"Aeryn?" Jack jumped on the unfamiliar name. "One of your people we're rescuing?"</p>
    <p>"She and Crichton, yes." He turned down another curved hallway, this one with lattice doors opening on either side. "Here's where you will stay," he told them. Rygel showed them how to open the doors to the three rooms on the hallway. Each one was spacious and sparse, containing only empty beds. The same soft glow filtered from the walls and ceiling. It looked cozy, if a little bare, almost like a cave.</p>
    <p>"I suppose you'll need blankets," Ryegl eyed the rooms critically. "Pilot," he said to the air. Daniel glanced at Jack and Teal'c who had raised an eyebrow, but then an alien voice rasped from around them. Rygel rattle something off in his own language.</p>
    <p>"Intership communications," Teal'c said softly.</p>
    <p>"What did he say?" asked Daniel, when Rygel finished. The small being added something else to the air before answering.</p>
    <p>"He's sending a DRD with blankets and microbes."</p>
    <p>"DRD?" "Microbes?" asked Jack and Sam at the same time.</p>
    <p>"Diagnostic Repair Drones," Rygel pointed to a yellow robot about the size of a cat approaching them on the floor. The little thing extended a syringe filled with a red liquid. "The translator microbes will let you understand all of us so we won't have to speak your barbaric language. Stark and Pilot don't speak English so you'll need the microbes to talk to them."</p>
    <p>"When you say microbes . . . ?" Jack left it hanging.</p>
    <p>"They colonize at the base of the brain and allow you to understand all other languages."</p>
    <p>"Uh uh, no, no way," Jack said stepping back. "I'm not letting anything into my head. Understand?" For once, Daniel was inclined to agree with him. He shot a nervous glance at Sam who had paled at the thought of something else in her mind.</p>
    <p>"Dominar, we've had some bad experiences with parasites," Daniel attempted to explain.</p>
    <p>"Who hasn't?" Rygel returned. "But the microbes only translate, they do not take over your mind."</p>
    <p>"Could we ever take them out?" asked Sam, eyeing the DRD with distaste.</p>
    <p>"Why would you want to do that?" he was genuinely surprised by the question.</p>
    <p>"Umm, it just wouldn't be a good idea," Daniel tried again. Janet would go ape-shit for one thing, not to mention the fact that they would probably be grounded by Hammond indefinitely.</p>
    <p>"Ridiculous!" Rygel snapped. On cue, the little DRD rolled forward towards Jack who reacted in typical Jack fashion. When the smoke finally cleared, there was very little of the yellow robot left and one very angry two foot alien flying out of reach. "What the frell was that for?!" he yelled.</p>
    <p>"Rygel! What happened?!" D'argo yelled over the communications. Daniel could hear the sound of running feet approaching from the hallway.</p>
    <p>"Sorry," Jack offered, not sounding in the least apologetic.</p>
    <p>"Jack." "Colonel," said Daniel and Sam reprovingly. He would never change.</p>
    <p>"I do not believe that aided our endeavor," Teal'c added as D'argo barreled in, sword in hand. He took in the remains of the DRD, Jack's weapon and the other guilty looking members of SG-1 quickly.</p>
    <p>"What happened?" he asked, lowering his sword.</p>
    <p>"He didn't mean to," Daniel said hastily, darting a glance at his sheepish CO. "The thing tried to give Jack microbes and he kind of overreacted. If there's some way to make this up to you, if we hurt the ship . . ." Daniel trailed off, hoping against hope that they hadn't pissed off their hosts by destroying their property. If the ship really was alive, who knew what kind of damage Jack had inadvertently done.</p>
    <p>"It's just that we really don't want those bug things in our heads," continued Jack. "We can communicate just fine as we have been."</p>
    <p>"You killed a DRD over translator microbes?" asked D'argo, clearly taken aback.</p>
    <p>"Rather be safe than sorry," Jack replied with tight smile. The person Rygel had been talking to earlier interrupted them then.</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry Pilot, but it's gone," D'argo answered, regarding the dead DRD sadly. Pilot asked something else to which the tall alien snapped, "No, it wasn't my fault! It was one of the humans!" He listened again to the tired voice. "He's not very happy with you," he told Jack.</p>
    <p>But thankfully, D'argo didn't seem to be angry about it, or Rygel for that matter. It was rather surprising considering that most captains - COs in general, he amended, thinking of Jack - tended to be possessive of their vessels and gear.</p>
    <p>"So you don't want microbes?" D'argo asked when the Pilot finally finished yelling at him. Another oddity that the crewman had such leeway to do so.</p>
    <p>"No," said Jack. D'argo sighed and shrugged.</p>
    <p>"Fine. You hungry?"</p>
    <p>"We don't have enough to feed them!" Rygel declared indignantly, but D'argo ignored him, gesturing for SG-1 to follow him. Leaving their packs, they once again entered the maze of golden hallways.</p>
    <p>D'argo showed them to the small dining room then left them to raid what served as a cupboard. A little surprised that they had to cook for themselves, Daniel was even more surprised that most of the food was recognizable. Cans of dehydrated vegetables, a little bit of frozen meat, and a large supply of flour and other baking goods sat on the shelves next to other foods in alien packaging.</p>
    <p>"The cuisine suggests that they were indeed on Earth," commented Teal'c as the four of them took stock of the pantry. Daniel nodded in agreement.</p>
    <p>"You know, I've been thinking about that," said Sam. Jack glanced at her to go on. Putting down her gun, Sam leaned against the table to give the rest of them room to cook. "We know that the stargate's language translation mechanism didn't work when we came through," she began.</p>
    <p>"We also didn't come out where we were supposed to," Jack interjected. "Do you see a frying pan anywhere?" Teal'c handed him one and passed a pot to Daniel for the green beans. The linguist listened as Sam continued, wondering now how he was going to get the can open.</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir. I think that's related. I think the gate we came through brought us to an alternate universe."</p>
    <p>"Like the mirror?" Daniel forgot about finding a can opener.</p>
    <p>"I don't know yet. But it would explain both why these aliens were on Earth without our knowing it and the language problem."</p>
    <p>"So how do we get back?" asked Jack, needing no further convincing. Funny how it all seemed normal in an odd way, Daniel thought.</p>
    <p>"I'll need to check out the stargate again," said Sam.</p>
    <p>"Unfortunately we are far from the stargate," said Teal'c. "Our hosts have brought us to another planet."</p>
    <p>"But they still need our help to get their friends out of the other place back there," said Jack. "I trust the big guy on that."</p>
    <p>This brought Daniel's head once more out of the search for a can opener. "Oh?" he asked, surprised. "Why's that?" at Jack's look he added. "Not that I'm disagreeing because I believe him too. But you normally don't . . ."</p>
    <p>"Follow strangers to other planets without a damn good reason?" finished Jack. "I know. It's just a feeling. Like with Teal'c. You've seen him with the girl. He just doesn't add up to being a threat."</p>
    <p>"Yet he is clearly a warrior," Teal'c pointed out. "And he is never without his weapon."</p>
    <p>"But he didn't ask us to check our guns at the door either," Jack indicated the guns and zats they all still carried. "We could take over this ship now if we wanted to."</p>
    <p>"Good heavens, why would you want to do that?" Startled, the four of them looked up at the old woman who just bustled in as if she owned the place. While Daniel assured her that they really had no intention of taking over the ship, she maneuvered him out of the way over the can of beans. Grabbing a knife from the counter, she quickly mangled an opening into the top and dumped the beans into the pot.</p>
    <p>"Good," she said brightly. "Because Moya, and Pilot for that matter, are really in no shape to do anything but heal. It wouldn't do any good to take her over. The water is in that container," she shoved the pot in Daniel's hands then pushed him towards said container none too gently. A little bewildered, Daniel did as he was told while the old woman sniffed the steaks Jack was frying, her eyes darting back and forth. "No spice," she declared grabbing a jar off the shelf above Sam. She took out some leaves, rolled them into a ball and spit on them. From another jar she took more leaves and mixed them with the first set, spitting on the whole thing again before ripping them to little pieces.</p>
    <p>"Oh, no you don't!" Jack snatched the frying pan out of her reach when she tried to scatter her saliva ridden herbs on the steak. "We like it just fine the way it is."</p>
    <p>"Nonsense. It will be bland without a little help," she said trying unsuccessfully to spice the steaks. Jack danced out of reach, and Daniel couldn't help but smile at the two of them.</p>
    <p>"Bland is good!" the colonel declared, raising the pan above his head and holding her off with an outstretched arm.</p>
    <p>"I believe O'Neill is trying to say 'no, thank you,'" Teal'c moved in between the two. Suitably distracted the old woman, who sidled up to the Jaffa with eyes flickering everywhere over his body.</p>
    <p>"But you wouldn't say 'no,' now would you?" she inched closer. "Tall, strong," she murmured. To his credit, Teal'c only lifted an eyebrow at her proposition.</p>
    <p>"I do not believe that would be wise," he said.</p>
    <p>"Wisdom is best left to those who do not have sex," she replied, grabbing his hand. Teal'c quickly pulled it away and stepped back before she could try again.</p>
    <p>Daniel blinked. She really was crazy! "So, uhh," he tried to think of something to rescue his friend. "How's Chiana?"</p>
    <p>"Chiana," the woman, Norianti he suddenly remembered her name, glanced at him, the predatory look replaced by one of concern. "She will survive. D'argo is with her now. Once Stark puts her to sleep he'll be down to discuss the plan."</p>
    <p>"Plan?" asked Jack warily. He still kept his body between her and the steak.</p>
    <p>"For getting John and Aeryn out," D'argo himself said from the doorway, joining them. "Why don't you finish cooking first. We'll talk while we eat."</p>
    <p>He leant a hand getting out plates and utensils while Daniel and Jack finished the steaks and beans. They were almost done when D'argo joined them at the stove. "She didn't put anything in them, did she?" he whispered anxiously.</p>
    <p>"No," Daniel smiled.</p>
    <p>"She tried, but we kept it all safe," Jack whispered back. D'argo heaved a sigh of relief, an almost comical expression crossing his face.</p>
    <p>"Good work," he clapped them both gently on the shoulder. Glancing at each other, Daniel and Jack joined the rest at the table, ready to serve.</p>

    There's no distance in Hell. 
    
    Bela figures out fast that the place isn't keen on constants of any kind. Even the pain isn't constant - oh, it's always there, but sometimes it eases up a little, probably to make sure she <em>really</em> feels it when it gets worse again. But nothing in Hell is static. There are a few landmarks she comes to recognize, sometimes close by, sometimes out of sight - a jagged spike of rock, a dark hole, a river of blood. She's can't tell how much of her shifting surroundings is real and how much is just in her mind.
    
    There's no time in Hell, either. She can only measure its passing in pain and screaming, so all she knows is that she's been there long enough to have learned to think through the lowest levels of torment when she first sees Dean Winchester.
    
    She blinks blood out of her eyes and looks at him. He's newly arrived, she can tell that much - still screaming his brother's name, begging Sam to come and save him. He'll give up on that soon enough, she knows. There's no hope in Hell.
    
    She doesn't think he sees her, and she's too hoarse from screaming to call out to him. Besides, she remembers what it was like when she first arrived in Hell. It'll be a while before he's aware of anything but the torment.
    
    The hook carving into her chest blazes white-hot, and she loses sight of him, swallowed up again by her own pain.
    
    <hr>
    
    "Dean."
    
    She doesn't know how long it's been. Long enough that his t-shirt is gone, rotted or ripped away, or maybe just abandoned by whatever part of his subconscious conjured it up. Long enough that when he raises his head at the sound of his name there's no hope left in the movement, just a weariness she knows only too well.
    
    It takes a moment for him to recognize her, and she tells herself it's because he's in pain, not because she's unrecognizable with the hook driven into her cheek.
    
    "Bela?"
    
    "In the flesh," she says. "So to speak."
    
    The corner of his mouth quirks up at that, and she feels a flash of <em>something </em>she can't put a name to, because Hell hasn't beaten him down completely yet. And if she can come that close to making him smile, then she's not as far gone as she thought after all.
    
    It's worth it, even when her chains tighten and tug her away sickeningly in the next moment, spinning her away from him before either of them can say anything else.
    
    <hr>
    
    "This isn't exactly how I pictured it," Dean says, the next time they find themselves near each other and they're both lucid at the same time.
    
    "You were expecting flames too, were you?" Bela asks drily.
    
    "And pitchforks," Dean says. "I feel cheated."
    
    "Don't give them any ideas," Bela says, and feels the humor slip away from her. It's hard to hold on to anything positive here for long, and she's thinking more of that than the chains when she murmurs, "Flames or not, this place is bad enough."
    
    "We'll get out," Dean tells her, and the statement is ridiculous enough to make her jerk her head round to look at him, ignoring the pain it causes as the hooks tear into her.
    
    "You've got to be joking."
    
    "Sam'll find a way," Dean says. "And hey, I'll let you tag along too. Even though you stole my car that one time."
    
    Bela knows there's no chance. She spent ten years searching, and if there was a way, she'd have found it. But she doesn't argue with him. The thin veneer of bravado feels like defiance, feels like a triumph in its own right, and that counts for something.
    
    <hr>
    
    There's no respite in Hell. She'd had ten years to imagine what the Pit would be like, and she'd always assumed that she would probably pass out from the pain at times, even though sleep wouldn't be an option. She'd wondered if she would go mad, and how long it would take, and whether it would seem like a blessing by then. But there's no refuge, not in sleep and not in insanity: awareness is a curse she can't escape, even when the agony is too overwhelming for her to be able to take in her surroundings. 
    
    The times when the pain eases up come as a relief, but they're hard in a different way. She's always bracing herself for the torment resuming, and though the waiting isn't worse - not even close - it's not exactly fun. Mostly she spends the wait counting - counting demons, the damned souls around her, the links in her chains.
    
    The demons don't bother with the damned much, but they make an exception for Dean. She can see them in the distance, crowding round him. Dean's responsible for sending a good number of demons back down here, she knows. A lot of them want to pay him a visit now that he's here too.
    
    She can pick out the pitch of his screaming among the cries of the other damned souls, even from this far away.
    
    <hr>
    
    "Cracking this easily?" she asks.
    
    Her voice is a shadow of what it used to be, but she manages to inject just enough contempt into her tone to achieve the desired effect. Dean blinks and turns his head slowly in her direction. He doesn't say anything, though, and she doesn't think it's just because he's still trying to catch his breath.
    
    She supposes this is why Hell lets them see each other from time to time: so they can watch each other slipping and changing, see each other being defeated.
    
    "Thought you were more of a man than that, Dean," she says.
    
    "Go to hell," he whispers, his voice cracked. It's still the sweetest sound she's heard in a while.
    
    <hr>
    
    "I always wondered if you'd scream in the sack."
    
    Bela forces her eyes open. Dean looks - well, knowing that it's not really his body doesn't make it any easier to see the way the skin has been flayed away right across his shoulder, exposing raw flesh around the hook. She can still remember, just about, the way he looked in a tux, the games she'd wanted to play then. Now -
    
    - well, it's not like she looks her best right now either.
    
    "Don't think <em>you </em>could have made me scream," she chokes out.
    
    It's comforting that he can still manage to be completely inappropriate, even in Hell. Bela tries to hold on to that, but she's screaming again before she can hear his reply.
    
    <hr>
    
    He stops screaming Sam's name, after a while. Now he just screams. Bela's already seen a hundred damned souls go through the same process: it happens to them all.
    
    "Eternity," she says at some point. "I never really understood what the word meant until now."
    
    "Not going to be here for eternity," Dean says.
    
    Bela sighs. It's been a while since he's said anything like that, promised her that Sam will find a way to get him out, that he won't leave her here, that he'll come back for her. She'd thought Hell had finally managed to snuff out the spark of faith in his brother that Dean kept holding on to. She can't figure out if she's irritated or reassured that it hasn't. "If you say so."
    
    "I guess they let us out of the chains when we turn into demons," Dean says, and she belatedly realizes there was no hope in his voice. "Or maybe the power to bust out of them comes as a package deal with the black eyes."
    
    Bela looks at him. "You mean -?"
    
    "This is how demons are made," Dean tells her. "That's what we're going to become, sooner or later." It's not just an absence of hope in his voice now: it's despair.
    
    Bela thinks about it, and wonders whether she'd prefer it to happen sooner or later.
    
    <hr>
    
    There's no light in Hell.
    
    Despite that, she can see, at least most of the time. There are shades of darkness, flashes of red and grey. And she supposes that since she's not really seeing with her eyes, she doesn't need light to make out what's around her anyway.
    
    When the white light appears in the distance, far above, Bela cries out, and hears every damned soul do the same.
    
    It's almost like a star, shining so brightly that she thinks she would be blinded if it was really her eyes she was seeing it with. It's falling into the darkness with such slow, elegant grace that Bela knows that in reality it's moving incredibly fast, just across an immense distance.
    
    The demons are crying out now too, fear and rage in their voices.
    
    Bela's chains snap taut, pulling her as far away as possible, and she can see the other damned souls being dragged with her, all of them pressed closer than ever before. Hell is rearranging itself, recoiling as if it fears the light.
    
    But the light moves faster, and she realizes it's heading straight for the damned souls. There's no hope in Hell, but Bela holds her breath anyway.
    
    Instead of coming to her, the light plunges down nearby, reaching out, and Bela hears a cry of shocked pain.
    
    She would know Dean Winchester's voice anywhere.
    
    Then the light is rising again. All around her the damned souls are wailing, begging; the demons are screaming, though none of them seem to dare to attack the light. Bela watches in silence. The light is too bright for her to make out more than the faint outline of Dean clutched inside it, and a hint of something that might be wings.
    
    Then it's gone, and Hell seems even darker than before. Bela stares at the point where the light disappeared, and thinks of how Dean used to promise her they'd escape.
    
    There's no hope in Hell, but she thinks knowing that Dean Winchester is back on earth might be the next best thing.

    <p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Jack watched John and Aeryn doze on the other side of D'argo's bed. They looked so peaceful resting against each other, so different from Aeryn's earlier coldness and John's wild psychosis. Even when they had been attacked on Moya there had been none of the desperation he had seen here. Jack just couldn't believe they had taken Daniel hostage. That had shocked him more than he expected, mostly because he liked them, trusted them, and never thought that they would turn on him.</p>
    <p>He sighed and shifted in his chair, his gaze coming to rest on D'argo's slumbering form. He couldn't blame them for wanting to protect their friend - hell, he'd been helping them, he gave them their guns back. At least it had ended with Daniel safely getting coffee with Sam and not lying next to D'argo.</p>
    <p>Jack's musings were interrupted by movement from the warrior's bed. A mumble of unintelligible words drifted out of the pillow. "D'argo," said Jack softly, rising out of his chair. A quick glance at John and Aeryn showed them still asleep, so no help there. He laid a hand on D'argo's shoulder. "D'argo, it's Jack O'Neill. I need you in English buddy." More incomprehensible garbage as D'argo tried to sit up. "Easy, easy," said Jack. He looked around and caught the eye of a nearby nurse who nodded and went to get Doc Frasier.</p>
    <p>"Where am I?" The croak that was D'argo's voice was no more than a whisper. "What happened?"</p>
    <p>Jack squatted down into his field of vision. "You killed the Nitwit when she tried to get in your head, got us out of our cell. We got back to the 'gate and now we're on Earth - our Earth anyway - in the infirmary."</p>
    <p>"John, Aeryn?"</p>
    <p>"Over there," he nodded over D'argo's shoulder. "Sleeping."</p>
    <p>"Mr. D'argo," Janet joined them. "How are you feeling?"</p>
    <p>"Like I have a hole in my head," D'argo grimaced.</p>
    <p>Janet smiled. "Well, that's a pretty fair assessment. Colonel, if you don't mind?"</p>
    <p>"Of course," Jack stepped back and got out of the way as Janet started her examination. D'argo made an interesting patient, first protesting but quickly quelled by a stern look. Jack let the inconsequential conversation wash over him, struck by how normal treating an alien was now. It wasn't until D'argo asked about General Forge a few beds over that he paid attention.</p>
    <p>"That's General Forge," said Janet with a slide-long glance at Jack. "He wanted to transfer you to another base for your recovery."</p>
    <p>D'argo looked over at his friends, still asleep next to Jack who still guarded their weapons. "He wanted to experiment on me?" Janet opened her mouth to reply but ended up simply nodding. "What happened?"</p>
    <p>Frasier lifted her eyebrows and smiled tightly. "Mr. Crichton took Dr. Jackson hostage and Ms. Sun shot General Forge."</p>
    <p>"John didn't build a bomb did he?"</p>
    <p>"What!?" Jack stood quickly.</p>
    <p>"What? Did someone say my name?" The noise had woken John and Aeryn who were now blinking off sleep. "D'argo!" said Aeryn, going to his side.</p>
    <p>"What's this about a bomb?" Jack joined them, catching D'argo's eye.</p>
    <p>"Bomb? What bomb?" John looked from one to the other.</p>
    <p>"I asked if you made one?" D'argo clarified intently. John looked confused for a moment before his face cleared and he shook his head.</p>
    <p>"No. I didn't. I'm not going to. As long as we get out of here," John slid cautious eyes to Jack.</p>
    <p>"You build . . . bombs?" Jack lifted an eyebrow, not sure he liked what he was hearing.</p>
    <p>"I also build spaceships and play golf on weekends. What's you handicap?"</p>
    <p>Jack gave a hardee-har-har shake of his head. He really didn't need this right now. What a headache. "Look you'll get out of here. Just don't build any bombs, okay?"</p>
    <p>John looked at him solemnly. "No bombs," he agreed. Turning to Janet he asked, "So when can we leave? Not that we're not enjoying our stay, but we'd like to get home before more of him show up," he gestured toward General Forge.</p>
    <p>"Well there's not much more I can do for you here," Janet spoke to D'argo. "Once you get back to your ship you need rest and fresh bandages, if one of you could take care of that?" she looked at Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"We'll get Chiana on it," she said.</p>
    <p>"Your doctor?" asked Janet.</p>
    <p>"His girlfriend," John nodded at D'argo. Jack's brows shot up, that was news.</p>
    <p>"Alright. I'd like to keep you here one more day and then first thing in the morning you're free to go," said Janet. She looked over the rest of them. "Now my patient needs to rest."</p>
    <p>"No, I'm fine - "</p>
    <p>"Rest," Janet told him.</p>
    <p>D'argo didn't dare voice another protest and lay quietly back on the bed. John and Aeryn settled into chairs nearby, not willing to leave him unguarded. All was quiet until Janet was safely in her office.</p>
    <p>D'argo sat up. "Are we prisoners?" he asked. John and Aeryn looked at each other before turning to Jack.</p>
    <p>"No," said the Colonel. "You're not prisoners. Really," he added when they just stared at him skeptically. "You'd be in a secure cell if you were, trust me."</p>
    <p>"Sorry, Jack," said Aeryn quietly. "For everything. It's just been . . ."</p>
    <p>"I know," said Jack. "It's okay. You're in a strange place with people coming after you. I'd probably do the same in your place." He thought about it and added, "I'm sorry it came to this."</p>
    <p>"So this happened with Teal'c? They wanted to cart him off to the farm?" asked John.</p>
    <p>"Yeah," said Jack. "It took a good deal of fast talking by General Hammond, but we got our dedicated friends at Area 51 to back off. Still, if it's not one thing with those guys it's another. To them the end justifies any means. Sometimes I feel like we're fighting this war on two fronts."</p>
    <p>They didn't say anything but from the way they glanced amongst themselves they understood. Mostly though, they looked tired. John scrubbed his face with his hands. "Yeah," he whispered. Aeryn ran her hand comfortingly over his hair and ended by grasping his hand.</p>
    <p>Feeling like he had outstayed his welcome, Jack took his leave and went in search of Daniel and Sam.</p>

    'Tell me.' Jensen's voice is harsh, inflexible as the hold he's got on Jared's wrists. He squeezes Jared's cock with his other hand, jerks him once, agonisingly slowly, tightening his fist again when Jared tries to buck up into his grip.
    
    'Tell me what you were doing,' he says again. He leans in close and sucks at Jared's neck, teeth scraping just right along the thin skin over Jared's pulse.
    
    'Trying - trying to make you jealous.' Jared's already close to losing it, gasping as Jensen jerks his cock again, thumb slipping up to rub across the head. 'Pay me some - oh - some attention, 'stead of talking with Chris all night.'
    
    'Pay you some attention?' Jensen gives him a long look, green eyes considering, weighing Jared up. 'Okay.'
    
    Abruptly, Jensen releases his grip on Jared. He trails his hand along Jared's side and up, teasing at a nipple till Jared cries out and surges up towards him.
    
    'Nuh-uh.' The easy tone belies the speed and strength with which Jensen catches at his wrists, bears Jared back down onto the bed.
    'You wanted my attention. Now you're gonna lie right there, like a good boy, while I give it to you.'
    
    Jensen keeps his hand resting heavy there a long moment, eyes locked on Jared's until Jared gives a little shiver and stops resisting, all the fight gone out of him.
    
    An hour later, Jensen pushes into him, <em>hot steady burn</em> against skin already licked and sucked oversensitive, and Jared feels himself shaking apart.
    
    He likes it when Jensen pays attention.

    Section 8: Plans<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>The food was plain, but still an unexpected treat for SG-1. It beat MRE's any day and most of the strange crap they were given when they were actually invited to eat on the worlds they visited. Though Jack found the familiarity in and of itself weird given the very alien nature of where they were.</p>
    <p>As for their hosts, they were definitely among the strangest aliens SG-1 had met. Five plus different - and O'Neill meant different - kinds of aliens living together on a ship that itself was alive was something they had never seen either. It was kind of like something out of Star Trek except that the captain didn't act like a captain, the crew didn't act like a crew, and there was a distinct lack of the "we come in peace" vibe. And despite all that, Jack found himself liking D'argo, even trusting him because of the blind girl.</p>
    <p>As for the others, Rygel struck him as stuck up but ultimately harmless, and Norianti, the old woman, well, she was just scary. Jack watched from across the table as she spit out a piece of chewed meat, mixed it with some stuff from her jars, chewed again, mixed in more stuff, then put it in a pocket. That was just gross and disturbing, and Jack really didn't want to know what she was saving it for.</p>
    <p>"So, uhh," Jack hastily turned away, "your friends. Why were they captured?"</p>
    <p>"From what we gathered at the planet, it was because the Qujagans had never seen their species before," D'argo answered. He took a sip of his drink before continuing. "Their current warlord likes having rare stuff and sends his people out to find it. That's why they came here. When they saw John and Aeryn in the boat," he gestured to the ocean out the window, "they shot them with something that made them shatter into pieces, collected them, and took them away."</p>
    <p>"They shattered into pieces?" said Carter in disbelief. "Are you sure?"</p>
    <p>"We saw it," D'argo replied coldly. Carter had the good grace to look away, but Jack could already see the wheels turning in her head.</p>
    <p>"Where are they now?" Daniel picked up the conversation.</p>
    <p>"They're being held in a science lab in the city," said Rygel. "It takes a few solar days to recover from the weapon, but once they do, the Qujagans will start with physical testing and interrogation. Then they move on to dissection."</p>
    <p>"Ouch," said Jack. That didn't sound fun.</p>
    <p>"How did you find all this out?" asked Daniel.</p>
    <p>"We asked one of the technicians," said D'argo.</p>
    <p>"Nicely?" Jack couldn't help but add.</p>
    <p>"Very nicely," Rygel said with a smile that was anything but comforting. Jack suddenly didn't want to know. His earlier assessment of the alien suddenly didn't feel as complete.</p>
    <p>"So, uhh, this plan of yours. What do you have in mind?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"It's quite simple," said D'argo. "We'll go in Lo'la, blast a hole in the front doors, run in, find John and Aeryn, get out, shoot anything that moves. Except John and Aeryn."</p>
    <p>Shocked, O'Neill stared at him. "That's your plan? That's a stupid plan."</p>
    <p>D'argo shrugged. "It'll probably work."</p>
    <p>His offhand words surprised Daniel and Carter out of their own surprise. "You can't just go shooting up their labs," Daniel protested, his fighting instincts giving way to the would-be plight of the scientists. "I'm sure that if you talk to them, you can work something out."</p>
    <p>"We tried negotiating," Rygel snapped. "They denied even having them."</p>
    <p>"Look," D'argo broke in, "I realize you don't want us killing people, but going in hard and fast is the only way to ensure that we get our friends out."</p>
    <p>"But they're scientists," Carter tried, her own sentiments clear. "They're not trained to fight. It would be a slaughter. They will be more inclined to talk- "</p>
    <p>"What is it with humans and talking?" asked D'argo, frustrated.</p>
    <p>"I don't know. I'm more of a shoot 'em up guy myself," said Jack. "But they do have a point."</p>
    <p>"We should not needlessly kill innocents," said Teal'c. "If it is as you say, then they have no choice but to carry out their orders."</p>
    <p>"So John and Aeryn should just roll over and let themselves be killed in the name of science? Would you?" D'argo fixed first Jack then Teal'c, Carter and Daniel with his gaze.</p>
    <p>"No. I guess not," said Sam looking away, guilty that she would kill even scientists to get away. Jack again saw why his general dislike for scientists had never extended to Carter. Much.</p>
    <p>"Of course you wouldn't," said Norianti. "You would fight." Jack nodded in agreement, briefly meeting D'argo's eyes. If it were his team in there, he would be planning exactly the same thing.</p>
    <p>"What if we just stun them?" Daniel asked, not willing to give up yet. "Get your friends out without killing anyone."</p>
    <p>"Stun them?" Rygel said disdainfully. "With what? Powder?"</p>
    <p>"I don't have enough hekkiah for that," muttered Norianti, busying herself once again with her leaves and spit.</p>
    <p>"Some of our weapons stun if you only fire them once," Daniel continued. Jack could have sworn he heard D'argo mutter "useless weapons." "We go in, get out. They wake up half an hour later. We're gone."</p>
    <p>"How 'bout it?" asked Jack, giving his stamp of approval. Hopefully it would keep everyone happy.</p>
    <p>"You know," said D'argo, "dead enemies don't come back and kill you."</p>
    <p>"We'll make more enemies if we kill them," Daniel countered. The two of them stared at each other, Daniel's stubbornness facing off against D'argo's own will to do it his way. "We don't have to kill everybody," Daniel broke the silence in a quiet but firm voice that Jack knew only too well.</p>
    <p>"Fine," D'argo acquiesced at last. "Use your stun weapons. I'll try not to mortally wound anyone I shoot at."</p>
    <p>"This is ridiculous," Rygel shook his head. Grunting in disgust, he shoved more beans into is mouth. D'argo shrugged philosophically and turned his attention back to his plate, not in the mood for anymore conversation.</p>
    <p>"So," said Jack, once more searching for something to break the ice that had settled over the group. Daniel and Carter were no help when he gestured at them to make conversation, and Teal'c merely did his eyebrow thing as if to say "that is not in my job description." With a sigh, Jack searched the room for anything, studiously ignoring whatever the hell Norianti was doing. The ocean out the window finally gave him something.</p>
    <p>"So how's the fishing out here?" he asked innocently.</p>
    <p>Both Rygel's and D'argo's heads snapped up and they exchanged a closed look. Jack just wondered what he'd said.</p>
    <p>"What is it with humans and fishing?" asked D'argo, staring at him like he'd grown a second head.</p>
    <p>"It's fun," said Jack a bit defensively. "There's this lake in Minnesota where the bass are this big," he held his hands about three feet apart. Everyone was staring at him now. And was that a grin Carter was trying to hide?</p>
    <p>"I do not believe fishing is fun," said Teal'c. "It was in fact unstimulating."</p>
    <p>"You're just mad because you didn't catch anything," Jack told him, not appreciating his betrayal.</p>
    <p>"Neither did you, O'Neill."</p>
    <p>"Well, that's not really the point now, is it?"</p>
    <p>"Indeed," Teal'c cut eyes at him with a lifted eyebrow. Jack shushed him with his hands and a disproving look.</p>
    <p>"He doesn't know what he's talking about," he told their amused hosts. Well, D'argo looked amused. Rygel just sniffed and crammed even more food into his mouth, if that was even possible. That had to be his tenth helping. Actually, Jack hadn't been paying too close attention since it was almost as disgusting to watch Rygel eat as Nori do her thing. "So your human friend likes fishing?" he grasped at the last thread of conversation.</p>
    <p>"He talks about it," D'argo nodded. "Went with his father when he was child."</p>
    <p>"Ahh. Do you know where?" D'argo shook his head, and Jack felt the conversation fall flat again as he lost what was left of commonality. A minute of uncomfortable silence followed until Daniel voiced the thoughtful look on his face.</p>
    <p>"Can I ask you something?" When he received a positive nod from D'argo, he continued. "How did you all come to serve on this ship? I mean you are all obviously from different species," Daniel hastened to explain. "It's just that almost all of the alien races we've come into contact with stick to themselves. They know of other aliens of course, but beyond alliances, they don't work together like this." He gestured to the ship at large.</p>
    <p>"Hmmph," was Rygel's response, while D'argo looked rather uncomfortable. "I wouldn't have been caught dead with them," Rygel gestured to the two other aliens at the table, "if it hadn't been for other mitigating circumstances."</p>
    <p>"What do you mean? You said you were a 'dominar'?" asked Daniel. "What does the title mean?"</p>
    <p>"Means he's annoying," D'argo muttered. Ryegl shot him a glare before answering.</p>
    <p>"I am -"</p>
    <p>"- was - "</p>
    <p>"Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth of the Hynerian Empire, ruler of over 600 billion subjects." The slug? King? Jack lifted his own eyebrows in surprise. He had to be lying.</p>
    <p>"And you're the captain of his yacht?" he asked D'argo with just a trace of sarcasm.</p>
    <p>"A what?"</p>
    <p>"Never mind."</p>
    <p>"So why are you here?" Daniel ignored the side conversation, getting back to the matter at hand. "If you are the ruler . . ." he trailed off.</p>
    <p>"I was deposed," Rygel said with such dignity that if he didn't look like, well, a slug, could have passed for royalty.</p>
    <p>"Well that sucks," O'Neill said without too much conviction. "What?" he asked when Carter gave him a look.</p>
    <p>"So why here? Why this ship?" Sam asked with a last glare at the colonel.</p>
    <p>"Moya used to be a prison ship," D'argo broke in with a grimace. Jack immediately sat up straighter.</p>
    <p>"As in . . . " Daniel trailed off again as diplomatically as possible.</p>
    <p>"You're escaped prisoners?" Jack had no qualms about diving onto this new bit of information. Granted they didn't have the whole picture, but a deposed king-person and the sudden knowledge that the big seven-foot alien was an escaped prisoner made him nervous. Even if he did like the guy.</p>
    <p>D'argo nodded, eyeing him carefully.</p>
    <p>"Well, I'm not," Nori declared before SG-1 could ask anymore questions. "I'm a liberated prisoner."</p>
    <p>Like that was so much better, thought Jack.</p>
    <p>"We're still not sure how she got on board," D'argo frowned. Nori just grinned at him as if she was hiding some secret that she would never tell. Or maybe it was just her. Jack grimaced, as she started humming and spitting again.</p>
    <p>"For what were you imprisoned?" Teal'c asked.</p>
    <p>"Can't remember," Nori answered with a smile. "Long time ago. Very nasty business," she added conspiratorially.</p>
    <p>"What about you?" Carter asked D'argo who had yet to reply. And it didn't look like he was going to from the way he kept his eyes on his plate.</p>
    <p>"I should take some of this to Stark." D'argo stood and went to the stove to fill up another plate then beat a hasty retreat from the dining room.</p>
    <p>"What was that about?" Carter asked, subdued by his sudden exit. Jack's own concern for his team shifted to worry about the alien whose whole body screamed pain and regret.</p>
    <p>Rygel shifted uneasily under the combined curiosity of the SG team. "Oh, stop looking at me like that!" he finally snapped. "If he doesn't want to tell you, then I won't either!" Jack exchanged a look with Daniel at Rygel's sudden loyalty since the two had done nothing but squabble. But then some friendships were like that. Nori watched them from hooded lids, tacitly acknowledging the scene before her. A few minutes into the uncomfortable silence, she left with her spitball. Rygel, having finally eaten his fill, soon followed.</p>
    <p>"So." Daniel looked across the table at the rest of them. Jack shrugged back. He didn't know what to think either.</p>

    "Seriously," Sam says. "Did you mean what you said before? You never have nightmares? Even with all the things we face every day?"
    
    "No, never," Dean says.
    
    It's not exactly a lie.
    
    <hr>
    
    The first time he had the dream, he was four years old. The only reason he even remembered, later, that that was when it all began, was because when he woke up screaming and didn't stop, the Guenthers took him to the hospital to see his parents.
    
    Daddy hugged him, but Dean didn't really stop crying until the nurse let them into the room where Mommy was sitting up in bed. Mommy looked tired, but she smiled when Daddy lifted him up to sit next to her, and she helped him carefully position his arms to support the bundle she put in them.
    
    "Dean, this is your baby brother," she said. "His name's Sam."
    
    Dean stared into Sam's wide, fascinated eyes, and felt his nightmare of pain and blood and fire slip into insignificance.
    
    "Hi, Sammy," he whispered.
    
    <hr>
    
    It's not really Dad's disappearance or his weird voicemail that send Dean to Sam. Which is not to say he's not worried, because he is: damn close to panic, if he's honest. Dad's taken off on solo hunts plenty of times, but never like this. Never without agreeing on a meet-up point first. Never without getting in touch every few days.
    
    But two and a half weeks after Dad vanishes, Dean dreams of being pinned to the ceiling again, and this time Sam is looking up at him, his eyes wide and horrified.
    
    He has the same dream two nights in a row, and knows the only reason he doesn't have it again the third night is because he doesn't sleep, driving through the night to California.
    
    <hr>
    
    The first year after the dream started, he had it a lot. He used to wake up screaming and terrified until Mommy came and hugged him.
    
    "It's not real, baby," she said soothingly, one night after the dream was particularly bad. "See, there's no fire. You're fine, everything's okay. Feel the bed?"
    
    Dean patted the mattress hesitantly, and scrunched his fingers up in the comforter.
    
    "See? It's real," Mommy said. "So if you ever wake up and you're scared, just tap the bed like that and you'll know it's real and you're awake."
    
    Dean looked up at her. "But you'll come, won't you, Mommy?"
    
    Mommy coaxed him into lying back down and tucked the sheets back over him. "I'll always come if I hear you, baby. But if I don't, you can come and find me, okay?"
    
    "Okay," Dean said, and closed his eyes.
    
    "That's my brave boy," Mommy said, and kissed his forehead. "Go back to sleep, Dean. Angels are watching over you, and I'm not going anywhere."
    
    <hr>
    
    There's not much time for sleep over the weekend, not with Sam insisting that he needs to be back in Palo Alto by Monday. Dean's still hoping that his brother will change his mind and come with him to keep looking for Dad, but he knows better than to expect it. Sam's changed a lot in the past few years, but he's not gotten any less stubborn.
    
    The few hours of sleep Dean does manage to snatch are full of fire and blood and Sam's horrified eyes.
    
    He really, really doesn't want to just drop his brother off and drive away like nothing's wrong, but Sam doesn't leave him much choice. It's not until he looks at the clock and notices, <em>really </em>notices the date and time that Dean figures it out.
    
    By the time he reaches Sam's apartment, he's walking into his nightmare. He drags Sam out of there, and doesn't spare Jess more than a glance.
    
    He's already lived this through her eyes, and he's pretty sure he'll be seeing her again in his dreams.
    
    <hr>
    
    Dean was nearly five the first time his dream came true.
    
    He'd woken up from it again, the same nightmare he always had. But it had been different this time - instead of him staring down into darkness, there had been yellow eyes looking up at him.
    
    Dean shivered and pressed his hand against the mattress the way Mommy had taught him. <em>Be brave, Dean</em>. He guessed Mommy hadn't heard him - she always came when he had his dream. But she'd said he could go and find her if she didn't. And he knew he had to tell her about the yellow eyes.
    
    He slipped out of bed and was almost at the door when the feeling of <em>wrong wrong wrong</em> hit him. Frantic, he pressed a hand against the wall, solid beneath his palm. He was awake. This was real. But somehow it felt like he was still in the middle of his dream.
    
    He could smell the smoke of the fire from his nightmare. 
    
    Dean took a deep breath and made himself turn the door handle. He needed to find Mommy.
    
    Out in the hallway, the stink of smoke was stronger, and the air was hot. Dean went towards the heat, because if this was his nightmare, he needed to see it.
    
    Daddy found him first, though, thrusting Sammy into his arms. The look in Daddy's eyes made Dean feel even more scared, but he tightened his hold on Sammy.
    
    "Take your brother outside as fast as you can - don't look back," Daddy told him. 
    
    Dean was still staring at the door to Sammy's nursery. <i>That's where the fire is. That's where the thing with the yellow eyes is</i>.
    
    <i>That's where Mommy is</i>.
    
    "Now, Dean, <em>go</em>!" Daddy shouted, and Dean turned and ran, clutching Sammy to him.
    
    Afterwards, shivering and pressed to Daddy's side, Dean wished that Mommy would come and make the nightmare go away again this time.
    
    <hr>
    
    They're in Toledo, Ohio, when Dean's patience with Sam's self-loathing finally runs out.
    
    "Now listen to me: it <em>wasn't your fault</em>. If you want to blame something, then blame the thing that killed her. Or hell, why don't you take a swing at me? I mean, I'm the one that dragged you away from her in the first place."
    
    <i>And I didn't figure out it was her I was dreaming about. I didn't insist on sticking around, even though I knew something was coming. If anyone should have been giving warnings, Sam, it was me, not you.</i>
    
    "I don't blame you," Sam says, soft but sincere. It doesn't make Dean feel any better.
    
    When Bloody Mary makes his eyes bleed, later, he doesn't know who it's for: Jess, or Mom, or any of the others. But he does know that in his case it's deserved.
    
    <hr>
    
    "- and then it turned into a flower and caught me," Lucy told the class, all in one breath.
    
    "That sounds like a very nice dream," Mrs. Marshall said brightly. "Why don't you draw a picture of the flower, Lucy? Okay, who's next... Tim? Can you tell everyone about the last dream you remember?"
    
    Dean sat very quietly, doodling on his piece of paper and listening to the other children talk about their dreams. It was like looking out a window onto a strange world. He'd never really realized that other people had lots of different dreams, not just the same one all the time. He'd never known dreams could be about things like flowers catching you when you fall, or driving a train that turns into a boat.
    
    He sat and listened, and hoped that Mrs. Marshall wouldn't call on him.
    
    <hr>
    
    "I have these nightmares," Sam says.
    
    "I've noticed," Dean replies. 'Noticed' is putting it mildly. Sam's been waking up damn near every night, screaming as often as not. Dean's been trying to get him to open up about them for months, and if Sam's finally ready to talk, great. Though Dean still doesn't see the connection to the old house in Lawrence.
    
    "And sometimes... they come true," Sam says.
    
    Dean can't even take that in. Sam did <em>not</em> just say - "Come again?"
    
    "Look, Dean - I dreamt about Jessica's death. For days before it happened."
    
    Dean has never once considered that he might not be the only one to have the dream. It's never even crossed his mind before. Ever since he realized, back when he was a kid, that other people had more than one dream and their nightmares didn't come true, he's known that it's just him, that he's different. Sam talked about lots of dreams, growing up. Surely Dean would have known if Sam had been having the same dream as him?
    
    His mind is whirling too much for him to do more than offer some B.S. about coincidences, but coincidence is one thing he's never been a big believer in.
    
    <hr>
    
    The dream lost some of its terror, after a while. It became familiar. Dean stopped waking up screaming a month or two after Mom died; he just lay there and pressed his hand against the mattress and waited for his breathing to slow down. A few years later, he barely woke up at all, his eyes blinking open only for a moment, his hand tightening around the comforter or his pillow, just enough to reassure himself he was awake before he dozed off again.
    
    Sometimes he wondered if the reason the dream no longer scared him as much was because it was the only link he still had to Mom. He couldn't exactly feel her presence, but he knew he had to be reliving what happened to her. Even that kind of indirect connection meant something.
    
    The dream never exactly became comforting, but it did eventually become normal.
    
    <hr>
    
    Mom looks exactly like how he remembers her from that night, but at the same time completely different. He guesses it's because he's not four years old any more. And because she's apparently a <em>ghost</em>. 
    
    He can't even think, as if his entire mind is shutting down in self-defense. He can only stare at her as she smiles at him. When she finally steps past him to speak to Sam, he turns to watch, even though he knows he should be keeping guard, watching for whatever has got Sam pinned. But there's no way he can take his eyes off her.
    
    Watching her vanish into flames for the second and the millionth time makes him want to kill things, and at the same time makes him want to curl up somewhere like he's four again.
    
    After that, the dream stops feeling like a connection to her. She's gone, truly gone. And he knows, somehow, that it's not really her death he's reliving. It hasn't been for a long time, if it ever was.
    
    His dreams are about the future, not the past. It's his own death he's dreaming of, and somewhere deep down, he's always known that.
    
    <hr>
    
    "I just..." Sammy huffed and fell down face forward onto his bed. "Don't you ever wish we could just be normal?"
    
    Dean looked up from his magazine. "What are you talking about?"
    
    Sam waved one arm vaguely, not bothering to raise his head. "Like a normal life! Where Dad's a... a mechanic or something, and we don't hunt, and all we've got to worry about is homework and tests and stuff. Don't you ever want something different?"
    
    Dean thought of the dream he was having almost every night. "No point in wanting the impossible."
    
    <hr>
    
    Dean doesn't know why he's surprised when Sam takes off for California instead of coming with him to investigate the case Dad's given them. Sam's always been this way - never follows orders, never just accepts what fate seems to be dishing out for him. Sam's always been convinced he can control his own life and do whatever he wants. It's something Dean doesn't really <em>get</em>, never has. He dreams about his own death most nights. He already knows what fate's got in store for him, and he's already seen it come true once, for his mother.
    
    He's always known there are some fates you can't escape. Particularly when you're a Winchester. But somehow Sam's never gotten that memo.
    
    He calls Sam, tells him he's proud of him for standing up to Dad and doing whatever he wants to do with his life, making his own choices. It's the truth; it's not like Dean's never wished things were different. He's just a realist: his fate's already written, and it's not one he's got a choice in.
    
    <hr>
    
    The dream varied slightly on occasion: once or twice he could feel someone else's presence with him on the ceiling, and what he saw below him wasn't always the same. But the dream only once changed so much that he was the one looking <em>up </em>at the ceiling.
    
    "Go to sleep, Dean," Cassie murmured, pressing kisses to his eyelids. "Dream of me."
    
    He did.
    
    By the time Dad called the next morning to say they had a job and needed to leave town, Dean's bags were already packed.
    
    <hr>
    
    The phone call from Cassie asking for his help almost makes Dean panic. He's not stupid enough to think that just because he's never had that variant of the dream again, it'll definitely never come true. So it comes almost as a relief to discover she's calling because she's got a psycho ghost truck on her hands, of all things.
    
    It's intense, seeing her again. After that version of the dream he made damn sure not to get that close to anyone else. Now, after what happened to Jess, he's even more certain that he's putting her in more danger just by being there. Maybe it's the fate that anyone who gets involved with a Winchester will suffer. Though that alone doesn't explain most of his dreams, because though some have been premonitions of someone else's death, most of them are about his.
    
    He's only human, though, and Cassie is special. They fall into bed together, and Dean doesn't regret it.
    
    He just makes sure he stays awake all night, keeping watch while she sleeps, his gun within reach.
    
    <hr>
    
    The dreams stopped coming for almost three years after Sam left for Stanford. Dean had never slept worse in his life.
    
    <hr>
    
    Dad dying is a worse nightmare than his dream, and this one Dean can't wake up from.
    
    He knows what Dad did, why he did it, and it messes with his head, but the truth is he's so fucked up by what Dad told him that he can barely focus on the rest of it.
    
    Killing Sam is just - it's not an option. Never. Dean doesn't know how Dad could even suggest it.
    
    His dream changes again, though, or rather, develops more variations. Sometimes Sam is still staring up at him in horror. Sometimes, though, his eyes are black, and he smiles. Sometimes he licks Dean's blood off his lips. Once or twice his eyes are yellow, and those nights Dean wakes up in a cold sweat and can't go back to sleep.
    
    He doesn't know which is worse: seeing his brother's horror, or seeing the lack of it.
    
    <hr>
    
    Dean thought about telling Dad, once or twice. Mostly when the dream got really bad, or there was a variation that worried him. He never got up the courage, though.
    
    Partly it was simple fear of Dad's reaction to the fact that Dean had kept something like this from him. Partly it was the fear - irrational, he knew - that Dad would blame him for Mom's death, feel he should have been able to warn her or Dad, somehow prevent it.
    
    Partly it was the fear that Dad would look at him like he did the supernatural things he hunted.
    
    <hr>
    
    Sam's angry when he finds out what Dad told Dean before he died - angry at Dad, and angry at Dean for not telling him sooner. Dean begs for time to fix things. He's scared, because now Sam's the one talking like he believes in inevitable and immutable fate, and that's always been Dean's territory. Suddenly Dean's the one who needs to believe that there's such a thing as free choice, that fate, if it exists, can be changed. His own death is one thing - he's been dreaming about it for long enough to be a realist about that - but the thought of losing Sam, of Sam going dark side, of Sam needing to be killed... that's not something Dean can accept.
    
    When Sam begs him - <em>begs </em>him - to promise to kill him if Sam turns into something they hunt, Dean makes the promise, and holds on to the versions of his dream where Sam's eyes are horrified when he looks up.
    
    His dream has variations for a reason, he has to believe that. They're all possible, and Dean's already made his choice.
    
    Sam's changed since Dad died, and Dean thinks there's more to it than just that loss, but he doesn't know what it is. Sam's more focused on him; he's stopped talking about leaving. He touches Dean more when he thinks he can get away with it. But Dean doesn't put the pieces together, not for a long while.
    
    Not until Sam sits down beside him one morning and reaches out to touch his face, turning his head until their eyes meet.
    
    There's a moment of stillness when Dean finally <em>gets</em> it, all of it: gets why Sam has been acting the way he has. Gets why he's always had the dream.
    
    Right now, it doesn't feel like fate. It feels like a choice.
    
    When Sam's lips brush his, Dean sees flames and blood in his mind's eye.
    
    He kisses Sam back.

    Section 37: Getting Back to Business<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>The next morning, after Dr. Frasier had checked over D'argo one last time, the three visitors were called to the briefing room to meet with General Hammond. John wasn't sure what to make of the summons but they didn't really surprise him. The General wouldn't let them just slip away, especially after yesterday's excitement.</p>
    <p>When they arrived with Dr. Frasier, Jack and the General were already seated at the long table. The Colonel was even smiling which John took as a good sign as he politely nodded to the General's bright greeting.</p>
    <p>"First, I'd like to apologize for yesterday," the General began. "I'm still at a standstill with the Pentagon on whether or not they wish to let you leave, but yesterday's situation has left them rattled enough that their previous orders are now strong suggestions." Hammond gave them a pointed look to let them know that he was going out on a limb for them. "In light of yesterday however, Dr. Rhodes and Dr. Dendron are willing to accept a compromise. Captain D'argo," he went on, "would you be willing to give Dr. Frasier a few blood samples so they may study its properties? I'm not asking you stay," he added hastily, "just to give blood. It will help in our fight against the Goa'uld."</p>
    <p>D'argo glanced at John and back to the humans. "Yes," he said. "I'll do that for you. But if you even think about taking me prisoner, I vow I will rip out your throat." John couldn't help grinning; the Luxan always said that. And usually it didn't help.</p>
    <p>"Thank you." Hammond turned to the rest of them. "Then as soon as you are ready, you're free to go." At his words, John felt a wave of relief wash through him. Gone was yesterday's hostility. Soon they'd be going home. He just hoped nothing else happened before now and then.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>The blood drive took less time than they expected - just three vials of quickly browning blood and they were on their way to the gateroom. Aeryn kept a wary eye on the halls they walked through, fearing that at any microt another problem would appear that would keep them buried in this mountain. But surprisingly, they made it to the stargate unhindered. However, SG-1 was waiting for them at the bottom of the ramp. She knew it had been too easy!</p>
    <p>"Didn't think you could just sneak out of here, did you?" asked Jack when the three from Moya stopped short. "Relax, we're just here to send you off."</p>
    <p>"We got you a few things, too," said Daniel lifting two green and red wrapped parcels, one in each hand. "Sort of a thank you for getting us back here." Sam and Teal'c were holding other parcels in the same gaudy paper. Aeryn looked at John who was speechless for once in his life.</p>
    <p>"Don't open them now," Jack broke the silence. "It'd be all mushy and there'd be paper everywhere. The General hates that." But from his ghost of a smile, Aeryn saw a friend trying to soften the parting. She would miss them, too.</p>
    <p>Joining them at the bottom of the ramp, John held out his hand which Jack shook heartily. "Thanks for helping us out," he said.</p>
    <p>"Oh, I think we're even" Jack replied. "It's been fun."</p>
    <p>"Fun?"</p>
    <p>"Well, you know," Jack shrugged. "Aeryn," he shook her hand, too. "Keep that kid of yours safe."</p>
    <p>"With my life," she replied. She shook the others' hands, pulled in unexpectedly by Sam for a brief hug and a knowing smile.</p>
    <p>"Good luck," the other woman whispered in her ear.</p>
    <p>And then the stargate groaned and alarms went off and finally the stargate burst to life. It truly was magnificent. Aeryn glanced around her at the stark gray room and the four people watching them go. They didn't know them well, but well enough.</p>
    <p>"Ready?" asked John taking her hand and giving it a squeeze.</p>
    <p>Aeryn smiled. "Let's go home." And they stepped through the wormhole.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Good people," murmured Daniel as the wormhole disengaged after the three travelers. "I wonder if we'll see them again."</p>
    <p>"I doubt it," said Jack. "But they sure made life interesting."</p>
    <p>On Jack's other side Sam snorted at the understatement. "I hope they'll be okay."</p>
    <p>"They are most resourceful," said Teal'c. "I believe they will be just fine wherever they are."</p>
    <p>And with that, the four friends left the gateroom for their long deserved time off.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Somewhere far from Earth in both distance and reality, after one last fight to take back Lo'la and a jubilant homecoming, John was reading aloud to Aeryn in their room on Moya. "Ellen, English form of Helen, see Helen," he turned a few pages. "Helen, means light."</p>
    <p>"No," said Aeryn from where she lounged comfortably against her mate's chest.</p>
    <p>"Eleanor," John continued reading from one of the books SG-1 had given them. The book of 20 000 baby names and What to *Expect When Expecting* had been Sam's gift to them. On the other side of the bed lay the Star Wars Trilogy courtesy of Teal'c who had noticed John's tv, and a pile of Dr. Seuss books from Jack and Daniel. D'argo had received *Risk Management for Dummies*, much to John's amusement when he read his friend the title</p>
    <p>For now, though, John and Aeryn were content to sit together and think about the future, at least the part they could control. D'argo was resting with Chiana who was still recovering from her injuries. Stark and Norianti were off with their own projects, and Rygel had stopped by to offer his name for consideration. Their ship sufficiently recovered, they were far from the Qujagan system in the emptiness of space. Moya was quiet. They were home. All was good.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************** End ************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Finished! Finally! I hope you enjoyed it. Now here's my final request. If you would be so kind, tell me your favorite part, favorite line - or most hated of both. Disappointments? Crowning glory? It doesn't have to be long, just one line, it takes two seconds so please let me know what you think.</p>
    <p>And did anyone catch the MacGyver, X-Men and random plant references?</p>
    <p>Thank you so so much for reading.</p>
    <p>Tassos</p>

    <p>So, my name's Jessica Moore, and it you know anything about me at all you'll know I died. A few years ago now, actually, and I'm as surprised as anyone to find that apparently that doesn't preclude me walking and talking and all that.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It apparently precludes me touching anyone else, though, which sucks. Particularly since that pretty much rules out continuing with the awesomely hot sex I was enjoying with Sam Winchester.</p>

    Section 9: Prisoners<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>It was late, but D'argo still sat by her side. Cleaned up properly, Chiana didn't nearly look half as bad as when the humans had found her. Norianti had sewn up the cuts and gashes, bandaging them with her plants and drugs to stave off infection. Blue bruises still peppered her body but they had at least stopped swelling. The old woman had been full of praise for the Qujagan healer's preliminary work and had quickly set to the long term healing Chiana needed.</p>
    <p>Sleep took five cycles off of her, D'argo noted as he watched the Nebari slumber. She had an innocence about her that shone through all the brighter when she was away from the cares of their existence. Such a remarkable woman, one able to win her place back in his heart.</p>
    <p>D'argo had been there perhaps three arns when her eyelids fluttered and slowly opened. "Chiana," he breathed so she would know he was there.</p>
    <p>She turned towards him, and he breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that her eyes were solid black and not the disturbing white of the blind. "I can see you," she whispered, tears coloring both her voice and cheeks. Gently, D'argo wiped them away.</p>
    <p>"I told you it would come back," he said softly, wanting suddenly to laugh for joy.</p>
    <p>"Five days, D'argo. I was blind for five days. It keeps getting longer. Someday I'm not going to get it back." Her breath hitched as she tried to hold back the fear. D'argo took her hand and tried to soothe her, careful of her wounds.</p>
    <p>"We'll worry about that if it happens," he said.</p>
    <p>"But - "</p>
    <p>"*If* it happens," D'argo repeated. With his free hand he grabbed the flask Norianti had left for when she woke. "Now drink this," he said, holding it for Chiana.</p>
    <p>"What is it?" she eyed the concoction suspiciously. D'argo just gave her a look that told her he neither knew nor wanted to know. "Right," she muttered before obligingly drinking the potion with a grimace. With a sympathetic smile, D'argo replaced the empty cup on the work table. Chiana closed her eyes and settled back into the few pillows on her bed, a flitter of discomfort crossing her face before settling into the comfort of the numbing draught. Sleep would soon come.</p>
    <p>"Have we found John and Aeryn yet?" she asked softly. Her eyes remained closed against hope. D'argo gently stroked her forehead.</p>
    <p>"We're going to rescue them tomorrow," he told her.</p>
    <p>Chiana's eyes flashed open, locking onto his. "When are we leaving?"</p>
    <p>"You're not going," D'argo corrected her. No way, no how was he letting her go beaten to within an inch of her life.</p>
    <p>"D'argo you need me." Chiana tried to sit up, but he pushed her back down.</p>
    <p>"I'm taking the humans with me. We'll be fine," he insisted.</p>
    <p>"You're taking *four* humans with you and you'll be *fine*?"</p>
    <p>D'argo had to admit she had a point there. But the bruises and stitches told him that Chiana was safer on Moya. Right now, she wasn't in pain only because the old woman had her drugged against it.</p>
    <p>"Look," she said reasonably, squeezing his hand, "I can cover you from Lo'la. I won't leave her, but you need me down there. Just in case."</p>
    <p>And looking into her deep black eyes as she struggled against sleep, D'argo knew that even if he did say no, she wouldn't listen. "You're not coming, and that's the end of it."</p>
    <p>"D'argo, you can't keep me here."</p>
    <p>"Yes, I can."</p>
    <p>"You can't. I'll be safe in Lo'la." She struggled to sit up again, but this time her own muscles refused to support her.</p>
    <p>"Just go to sleep," D'argo sighed. Finally succumbing to the drugs, Chiana slowly went to sleep again, never relaxing her grip on his hand.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>The humiliation of being poked and prodded buck naked by a bunch of funny- faced aliens wore away with the arns that passed. Tired, gagged, fed up, and helpless to do anything more than pull on his chains and worry about Aeryn, John retreated to his thoughts which thus far had remained sacrosanct. 'Scorpy did worse to me,' was the litany that ran through his mind as cold hands and needles went where they had no right to be. However it was little comfort to his present predicament. Even now his mind refused to confront the invasion of his body head on.</p>
    <p>Instead, he stuck to worrying about what was happening to Aeryn. If her 'examination' was anything like his, she and more importantly the baby were probably doing as well as he was. Hopefully better. Hopefully, she had escaped when they came for her, but John wasn't holding his breath. No, they would have to wait for the cavalry in the form of one pissed off Luxan and his badass ship. D'argo would come, John had faith in that.</p>
    <p>When the door opened, he automatically looked down to see what new toy the mad scientists had dragged in. But it wasn't a toy; instead it looked like the head honcho. The newcomer was a little taller than the others and dressed in black instead of the dull blue and gray of the pokers-and- prodders. And that was definitely a gun strapped to his leg. Must be compensating for something. John was once again painfully aware of his own lack of covering. Defiantly, he met the soldier's eyes and didn't back down.</p>
    <p>"The male?" the newcomer asked the chief scientist.</p>
    <p>"Yes, lord," said the latter as one would to a near equal. Unlike most of the others, he did not duck away from the 'lord.' "They appear to be of the same species, although as you know we have not finished our examination. Tomorrow we will begin the interrogation, if you wish to attend."</p>
    <p>"Hmmm," was the only reply as the lord once again raked his eyes over the human, his face splitting in what John had come to recognize as getting a better look. "There are no others?"</p>
    <p>"No, lord. Simply these two. It will be a shame to lose them when we begin our interior investigation."</p>
    <p>John jerked in response, his synthetic chains clattered against each other. That did not sound good.</p>
    <p>"Hmmm," the lord murmured again. "We shall see." He turned then and left the room with the chief scientist.</p>
    <p>As the rest of his torturers finished their tests, John's mind was spinning with the implications of 'interior investigation.' Somehow, he didn't think it just meant sticking more sticks up his butt. And what about Aeryn? The baby? What would happen when it was discovered? Images from his nightmares of when Aeryn was the Scarrens' prisoner leapt out him.</p>
    <p>D'argo would come. That was a simple fact. But timing had never been their strong point. As he was led back to their cell, John paid even closer attention to the hallways than he had on the way out. Hallways, turns, soldiers, scientists, hiding places, he hoped he could remember it all.</p>
    <p>Aeryn was sitting with her back against the far wall when John arrived. The same five guards that had escorted them out stood watch while his hands were unshackled and his gag removed. When they were finally alone, Aeryn said, "We have to get out of here."</p>
    <p>"So you heard about the 'internal investigation,' too?"</p>
    <p>She nodded in reply as he sat down next to her, pulling her close for warmth. "It'll be soon."</p>
    <p>"We have at least a day. They're gonna interrogate us tomorrow," John told her.</p>
    <p>"We should be out of here by then."</p>
    <p>"You got a plan?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn smiled. "I've been thinking."</p>
    <p>"Good." John kissed her. "So have I."</p>

    The first time Dean accompanied his father on a hunt, he was eight years old.
    
    It was a simple salt and burn, nothing more complicated, or John wouldn't have taken him along at all. Even then, it only happened because Sam was still recovering from a stomach bug and was staying with Pastor Jim. Dean had been begging his father to let him come along and help ever since he was six and had learned to shoot, but he knew the first priority had to be protecting Sammy, and that was his job. With Sammy in safe hands, though, his father took Dean along on his "business trip" that evening.
    
    The graveyard was dark and deserted, and Dean clutched the salt and the lighter fluid tightly as he followed his father between the graves. He wanted to ask his father how he knew where the grave they were looking for was, but something about the darkness of the cemetery didn't permit questions.
    
    "Here we are," his father said finally, setting down the shovel he was carrying. "Marie Leyman." Dean studied the grave, trying to look as confident as if this was nothing new, nothing out of the ordinary. The stone had only the name and dates carved into it. He counted silently in his head: she'd been 24 years old when she'd died. The funeral hadn't been that long ago: there were still flowers on top of the grave, wilted and turning brown.
    
    "Her ghost has been haunting the bridge where she died," his father told him. "So we're going to lay her to rest, Dean. We're going to dig until we find her coffin, and then salt and burn her corpse."
    
    Dean liked that "we". It felt awesome to finally be able to help. "Can I help to dig?"
    
    His father laughed. "I think the shovel might be a bit heavy for you, kiddo. Tell you what, why don't you clear those flowers out of the way? That'd be a great help. Just pile them across there, we'll put them back when we're done."
    
    Dean set the salt and lighter fluid down, then stepped up to the grave. It felt weird, taking the woman's flowers, but it was probably okay if he was going to put them back.
    
    There was a bunch of white roses, petals crinkled up and brown along the edges. Dean lifted them gingerly and carried them out of the way, swallowing hard as the smell wafted up at him, sickly sweet amidst the rot. There was an arrangement of mixed flowers, yellow and pink and purple, he thought, though he didn't know their names and the colours were hard to make out now. Some of the flowers had withered completely, were hard to the touch and shrivelled beyond recognition. Others were still dying, and those were almost worse. Their smell hadn't faded entirely.
    
    Dean was glad when the last of the flowers were out of the way.
    
    "Good," his father said, and picked up the shovel. "Okay, Dean, watch and see how it's done, and maybe you can help with this part next time."
    
    Dean watched with interest as his father dug up the grave. It took longer than he'd expected, and there was a lot of soil piled on the edge by the time his father said, "Okay, here's the coffin. See, Dean?"
    
    He had to stand right on the edge to see down, because the hole his father had dug was very deep.
    
    "Okay," his father said. "I'm going to use the shovel to open the coffin. It's not going to look or smell pretty, so I want you to go back a few steps and put your hand over your nose, got that, Dean?"
    
    Dean half-wanted to argue - he wasn't some clueless little kid who needed to be protected - but he knew better than to talk back to his father, particularly on a hunt. Besides, part of him wasn't entirely sure he really wanted to see. The flowers and the grave were creepy enough. A dead body... He backed off a few paces and obediently covered his nose.
    
    There were several sharp cracking sounds as his father smashed open the coffin. Dean suppressed his curiosity with an effort and picked up the salt, keeping one hand over his nose. 
    
    His father tossed the shovel back up onto the edge of the grave, then pulled himself out after it. Dean carried the salt across to him.
    
    "Thanks, Dean," his father said, getting to his feet and taking the canister from him. "Would you pass me the lighter fluid, too?"
    
    Dean did so while his father scattered salt down into the hole, then Dean picked up the shovel to carry it back out of the way. He couldn't help glancing down for a moment, that close to the edge.
    
    The body was gross. Seriously gross. Dean kept his hand clamped across his nose and backed away with the shovel as quickly as he could, struggling to drag it with only one free hand.
    
    His father sprinkled lighter fluid into the hole too, then pulled out a book of matches. "Next time we do this, you can do this part, Dean, okay? If it's just bones we're dealing with."
    
    "Cool," Dean said, muffled by his hand. He was just as glad his father wasn't about to let him do that this time. Cool though it would be, he didn't really want to see that rotting body again, the sight of all that blonde hair surrounded by decomposing flesh, mottled and wrinkling like the flowers he'd moved away from the grave.
    
    Afterwards, when they arrived back at Pastor Jim's, Dean took a long shower, trying to scrub the smell off himself. Not so much the smell of the smoke, but the sweet, dead scent of the decaying flowers.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Pastor Jim's garden was small: the grounds of the church weren't particularly large, and there were only a few flower beds over by the wall. Sammy was picking flowers when Dean found him.
    
    "Look, Dean!" Sammy exclaimed happily, thrusting the bunch he was holding towards his brother. "Pretty flowers!"
    
    Dean swallowed hard and managed not to take a step back. "Sammy - you can't just pick them!"
    
    Sammy looked worried for a moment, then brightened. "But Pastor Jim said I could! Said they'll look pretty in our room and smell nice too. Look, roses!"
    
    Dean stared at the roses - mostly just the heads, really, as Sammy had evidently struggled with the thick stems. "Yeah, I see that." All he could see in his mind's eye was the decaying flowers he'd moved from the grave the week before, wilted and dead.
    
    "Don't you like them?" Sammy asked, looking crestfallen.
    
    Dean forced himself to smile. It wasn't Sammy's fault, after all. He was too young to know he'd killed all the pretty flowers he was holding. "No, they're... nice, Sammy. Pretty."
    
    Sammy beamed again. "Come help me put them in a vase!"
    
    The vase of flowers ended up in the kitchen, much to Dean's relief. He wasn't sure how well he'd have been able to sleep if they'd been put in their bedroom. The sickly sweet scent of the flowers was enough to put him off his food.
    
    In bed that night, Sammy said, "Dean?"
    
    Dean turned his head to look across at him. "What?"
    
    Sammy's voice was very small when he asked, "Did Mom like flowers? Is that why...?"
    
    Dean turned away. "Go to sleep, Sammy."
    
    The truth was, he didn't know whether Mom had liked flowers. He couldn't remember seeing her with any, but that didn't mean anything. His memories of her were fading, slipping away from him. The thought of blonde hair brought back clearer memories of the half-glimpsed corpse from the week before than of his mother.
    
    He was losing her again, and it wasn't Sammy's fault - Sammy couldn't remember her at all, which always made Dean feel sorry for him - but Dean couldn't talk about her, not now.
    
    He thought about asking their father whether Mom had liked flowers, and wondered whether the chance of getting an answer was high enough to make it worth his father's inevitable drinking session afterwards.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Palo Alto was surprisingly cold in January, or maybe Dean was just an emo little bitch.
    
    He had every right to be there, he told himself. Palo Alto was totally on the way to Arizona. Okay, so maybe not when you were starting from Utah, but hell, it wasn't like anyone gave a damn.
    
    Even though he had every right to be there, he wasn't sure Sam would agree he had the right to follow him around all afternoon. But what Sammy didn't know wouldn't hurt him.
    
    He sat up straighter in the Impala as Sam ducked unexpectedly into a store on the corner. He'd been expecting Sam to head straight back to his dorm, but evidently Sam had an errand to run. At the florist's.
    
    Dean frowned, then slid slower again in his seat when Sam re-emerged a few minutes later holding a huge bouquet. No roses, but lots of pink carnations and white sprinkly flowers, all wrapped up in clear plastic so they could fake being alive for a bit longer.
    
    Sam headed off in a direction Dean wasn't familiar with - not his dorm, not where his classes were held, not work, not the library. Presumably he was going to take the bouquet to whatever chick he'd bought it for. Dean wondered whether to follow.
    
    His cell phone rang in his pocket, and Dean pulled it out, hitting the button. "Hey."
    
    "Hey, Dean," his father said warmly. "Happy birthday, son."
    
    Dean watched Sam turn the corner, flowers in hand. "Thanks, Dad."
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Sam didn't speak on the way to the cemetery.
    
    Dean didn't bother casting around for something to say. He wasn't too good with words at the best of times, and they weren't going to do a goddamn thing to help Sam at the moment. In the silence, the scent of the flowers in Sam's lap seemed to expand and fill the whole car, overpowering and deathly sweet.
    
    Sam was staring at them, or through them. Dean wasn't sure which.
    
    "She hated roses," Sam said unexpectedly as they pulled up next to the graveyard.
    
    Dean darted a quick glance at him. Sam's voice was unsteady, and he was still staring at the flowers. The suit was all wrong on him, made him look like a stranger, not the Sammy that Dean knew at all.
    
    "They're nice," Dean hazarded. "Those ones, I mean." He didn't say <em>I'm sure she'd like them</em>; he didn't think he had that right.
    
    "Yeah," Sam said, and fell silent again, before finally getting out of the car.
    
    Dean let him go to the grave by himself, and was waiting when he came back, blank-eyed and silent.
    
    The scent of the flowers lingered all the way back to the motel.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Okay, Sam was gigantic enough at the best of times. There was absolutely no call for there to be <em>two</em> of him. That was just unfair.
    
    "Dean?" both of the Sams asked. "How many fingers am I holding up?"
    
    Dean tried to focus. "Which one of you?"
    
    "Uh-huh," the Sams said. "Okay, c'mon, big brother."
    
    Dean thought the whole pulling-to-feet plan would have worked better if the Sams had taken a side each, but the world was spinning a bit too dizzily for him to complain other than by groaning. He leaned against the nearest Sam and held on.
    
    "Easy," Sam's voice said soothingly. At least he hadn't cloned his voice, too. "It tossed you against that gravestone pretty hard, huh? The thorns on those roses have bloodied your face up, too."
    
    Well, that explained why his cheek was stinging. "Fucking flowers," Dean muttered and held on tighter to Sam as his brother tried to move. The moving thing was not a good idea, he felt.
    
    "C'mon, Dean," Sam coaxed. "Back to the car, then we'll go to the hospital and get you patched up, okay?"
    
    Oh no. Not okay at all. The world was spinning too horribly for him to speak, but something of his feelings must have been communicated to Sam, because his brother said, "Dean, you've got a concussion, man. We're <em>going</em> to the hospital."
    
    An arm settled more securely across Dean's shoulder, supporting him. Dean didn't open his eyes to see which of the Sams it belonged to, though.
    
    A year or two ago he'd have been able to order Sam to drive back to the motel instead, but Sam had gotten touchy since he'd broken Dean's deal. He'd take Dean to the hospital for a splinter these days, given half a chance, and never mind the fact that the FBI was after them and their insurance was non-existent.
    
    Fuck, his head hurt. What the hell had even happened?
    
    <em>Ghost</em>, a scrap of memory prompted unexpectedly. Huh. "Ghost?"
    
    "Gone," Sam said. "I took care of it. But the fact that you're only asking now is exactly why I'm taking you to the hospital."
    
    "No," Dean said, vaguely aware even as he said it that he sounded like a fretful child. He had to convince Sam somehow. "Sam - Sammy, no. Hate hospitals. Motel."
    
    "I know you don't like them, but I want a doctor to take a look at whatever damage you've managed to do to your head this time," Sam said.
    
    Too many words. "No," Dean tried again. "Too clean, and... ghosts everywhere. And flowers. They bring you <em>flowers</em>, Sam."
    
    Sam had the nerve to sound amused, the bastard. "Sometimes, yeah. I promise they won't claw up your face like those roses, though."
    
    Dean wasn't reassured. "Fucking hate flowers."
    
    His brother huffed a laugh. They stopped moving for a moment, and Dean heard a click before Sam was pushing him gently backwards. Oh. They were at the car. He let Sam manhandle him into place, and tilted his head back gratefully, letting the comforting smell of the Impala surround him.
    
    He heard doors opening and shutting, but they seemed to be coming from a long way off. It took a while for Sam's voice to penetrate. "Dean. Dean!"
    
    Dean groaned softly at the disturbance.
    
    "Dean, you can't go to sleep," Sam said urgently. The engine roared into life. "C'mon, Dean, you know the score. Open your eyes, talk to me."
    
    "Tired," Dean mumbled.
    
    "I know, I know," Sam said. "And you can sleep soon, but not yet, okay? I need you to stay awake for me for now. Talk to me - tell me why you hate flowers or something, Dean. Dean! Hey. They just too girly for you, is that it?"
    
    Dean frowned sluggishly and tried to force his eyes open. "Flowers... not girly, they're <em>creepy</em>. It's fucked up."
    
    "Creepy?" Sam said. He sounded kind of incredulous, but maybe Dean's hearing was just screwed up. "What's creepy about them, Dean? Tell me, come on."
    
    "Fucking dead," Dean told him. "Pretend to be alive, and everyone says <em>oh, so pretty</em>, and they're dead and just don't look like it yet. They're like - like zombies. Fucking zombie flowers, all over the place."
    
    Sam made a choking sound. Dean thought maybe he was getting through to him. "Smell like cemet- cem- graveyards," he continued. It suddenly seemed very important that Sam understand this. "You wake up in hospital, and it's like - you think you've been buried or something, till the drugs wear off, with the smell of them. All the zombie flowers. Zombies don't kill flowers, they just make them look like they should. Already dead to start with. And I never asked Dad if she liked them."
    
    He trailed off, swallowing a weird lump in his throat. God, his head fucking hurt. Where were they even going?
    
    "To the hospital," Sam said, so either his freaky brain powers were making a comeback, or Dean had said that out loud. "But hey, Dean - look, no flowers, okay? I promise."
    
    "Really?" Dean asked cautiously. "Sometimes they bring 'em while I'm sleeping."
    
    "I'll make sure none of the - the zombie flowers get near you," Sam said. His voice sounded weird, kinda choked. "I promise, Dean. I'll keep the zombie flowers away while you're sleeping."
    
    Dean sighed, but relaxed slightly. Sam mostly kept his promises, particularly about saving Dean from things. "Okay. Hospital."
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    The first thing Dean saw when he opened his eyes was Sam grinning at him. It was always an awesome sight to wake up to, no matter what he told Sam.
    
    "Hey," Sam said cheerfully. "How are you feeling?"
    
    "Urgh. Okay," Dean said, touching his head gingerly. "What happened?"
    
    "Concussion. Ghost tossed you into a gravestone," Sam said. "You're in the hospital."
    
    Oh, yeah. Now Sam came to mention it, the overly sterile surroundings did have that hospital feel. Dean glanced around and paused at the sight of something bright and bouquet-shaped on the bedside table.
    
    "Ah," Sam said. The way he was grinning was doing nothing to reassure Dean. "I thought you probably wouldn't appreciate any, um, "zombie flowers" -"
    
    Oh, fuck. What the hell had Dean said while he was out of it?
    
    "- So I got you a chocolate bouquet instead," Sam continued. "All they had were rose-shaped ones, but I figured you'd put up with that, since they don't have any thorns."
    
    Dean stared at the foil-wrapped chocolate flowers. Now Sam mentioned it, he could smell the chocolate.
    
    "No zombies involved," Sam said, fighting to keep a straight face and failing utterly.
    
    Dean scowled at him. "Go find a doctor to bust me out of here, bitch."
    
    "If you're sure you can fend off the zombies while I'm gone -" Sam started, and beat a hasty retreat before Dean could throw the TV remote at him, his laughter echoing down the corridor after him.
    
    Dean watched him go, then reached up and snagged one of the chocolate flowers.

    <p>Section 1: Broken Doors</p>
    <p>Colonel Jack O'Neill knew something was very wrong the minute he was spit out of the wormhole. Literally spit. With air beneath his feet and sky in front of his face, Jack flew head over heels, landing with a heavy, painful crash on a heap of metal.</p>
    <p>"Oww." That hurt. Carefully picking himself up, he looked around. Oh yeah, something was very wrong. "Carter."</p>
    <p>"Sir?"</p>
    <p>"Uh, Carter? Aren't there supposed to be trees?"</p>
    <p>Carter looked around as she tried to stand on the shifting metal she had landed on. Instead of the trees and calm landscape of a deserted planet brimming with natural resources, she saw only what could be described as a junkyard. Mountains of scrap heaps like the one they had landed on, surrounded them. Easily three stories high worth of twisted metal glittered next to parts that had succumbed to rust. Behind them, the stargate lay almost flat on the pile, the slope explaining their brief flight.</p>
    <p>"Carter?" O'Neill repeated.</p>
    <p>"We dialed the right gate, sir," the Major said defensively. "I don't know what went wrong."</p>
    <p>"Uh, Jack?" said Daniel nervously. "There doesn't seem to be a DHD here." Carter turned and made her way up to where Daniel crouched by the gate. Terrific.</p>
    <p>"Any way you can get that thing to work?" Jack asked following her.</p>
    <p>"Don't know yet, sir."</p>
    <p>"Let me know when you do." O'Neill let her and Daniel do their thing while he joined Teal'c in checking out their surroundings. They were about halfway up their particular scrap heap that undulated into peaks in either direction with no evidence of the ground, simply lower levels of junk. It was almost entirely metal, no garbage or bio-waste. Jack saw what looked like a smashed glider across from where he stood and a rusted train wreck not far from that.</p>
    <p>"Anything?" O'Neill glanced up at the two scientists by the 'gate who looked at each other before Sam shook her head.</p>
    <p>"There's no DHD," she said. "We might be able to find what we need here to hot-wire it," she gestured vaguely at the junk piles. "But we'll still need a power source."</p>
    <p>"Alright." Jack looked around again then nodded up the hill. "Let's go see if we can find out where we are first. Then we'll see about getting some batteries."</p>
    <p>The climb to the top was better than O'Neill had expected. There were enough larger chunks to get a solid foothold without slipping and twisting an ankle. A few short minutes later, Jack was standing on top of a wrecked car-like thing with Teal'c taking in the view. Below them, the junkyard continued for roughly a hundred feet in most directions before getting cut off by a high fence. Beyond, they were surrounded by a city. The area they were in was obviously low rent from the look of the grungy, squat buildings with visible repairs. There was a lot of foot traffic, interspersed with coughing vehicles heading away from the junkyard toward taller, more stable buildings farther off. The people were too distant to really distinguish whether they were human or not. All Jack could tell was that they were a pretty drab bunch dressed mostly in blacks and grays.</p>
    <p>"What do you think?" he asked the Jaffa next to him.</p>
    <p>"It appears we have found an advanced people," Teal'c pointed off to the right where a ship was entering the atmosphere. They watched it slow its descent and land like a hovercraft among the buildings somewhere.</p>
    <p>"They're advanced, and looking at the wrecks lying around, I'd say they're potentially dangerous, too," added Carter. "Most of them look like they were destroyed by weapons fire."</p>
    <p>"Anything familiar?" O'Neill asked.</p>
    <p>Carter shook her head. "They're definitely not Goa'uld," she said. "I've never seen systems like them. It looks like they use - "</p>
    <p>"Carter," O'Neill interrupted her before she got going. "So the General thinks we're on some harmless planet. We've got a broken gate, no way to start it, and a big city of unknown hostiles. Any suggestions?"</p>
    <p>"Jack, we can't judge the whole population by a few burn marks in a junkyard," said Daniel.</p>
    <p>"I knew you were going to say that," Jack sighed. He really didn't like this situation. "Alright kids, it looks like we're going to town." Hefting his weapon, the Colonel led the way down the other side of the metal mountain toward the fence. Once they were at the perimeter, it would be easier to find a gate into the city. The walk down was slower than the climb up since there weren't as many large parts to act as boulders. As they neared the fence, the mountains turned into rolling hills, getting smaller and more dangerous as they went. Jack kept a watchful eye out for any sign of life, specifically an alien version of an angry yard boss with a shotgun, but so far all was quiet.</p>
    <p>Until a loud crash of breaking glass sounded behind him. "Dammit," Daniel swore, one leg through a cockpit window that had given way beneath his weight. Jack quickly backtracked to where his friend was carefully extracting his leg.</p>
    <p>"Are you okay?" he asked anxiously. He did not need Daniel hurt on top of everything, and if an artery had been cut . . .</p>
    <p>"Yeah, I'm fine," Daniel answered. "Really. See, no blood." Jack inspected the leg himself and there was blood, but just a few scratches, nothing life threatening.</p>
    <p>"Are you sure you're okay?" he asked again.</p>
    <p>"Jack," Daniel gave him one of his disapproving looks. "I'm fine."</p>
    <p>"Okay." He knew better than to push. Daniel was fine, and they had bigger things to worry about. With a pat on the back, O'Neill nodded to Carter and Teal'c then started back toward the fence.</p>
    <p>It only took about twenty minutes to finish their descent. The fence itself was made of iron bars and was about two stories high. On the other side, buildings leaned against it for support. And the stench . . . Jack tried not to think about all the rot and refuse that must be at home in the quarter. Yep, definitely the bad part of town.</p>
    <p>"Jack!" Daniel cried, leaping past his CO and dashing down the narrow path that ran along the fence.</p>
    <p>"Daniel, wait!" he called as he ran after the archaeologist, dreading what he had found, and then both surprised and not when it turned out to be a girl.</p>
    <p>"Oh God," said Daniel as he crouched beside the girl's body. Jack knelt beside him and checked for a pulse. There. Not in the right place, but steady all the same. Her skin was completely white as was her short hair. Blue blood oozed from cuts that covered her body along with a peppering of what had to be bruises. What was left of her clothing was torn and from the looks of it she had also been raped. She couldn't have been more than twenty.</p>
    <p>"She needs a doctor," said Carter joining them on the ground with the first aid kit. "If</p>
    <p>only we could get back to the SGC."</p>
    <p>"Well we can't," Jack replied, angry himself that they couldn't. Angry at the creatures that had tortured and left this little girl to die in a junkyard where no one would find her body. Ever.</p>
    <p>"We can't just leave her. We have to get her to a hospital or healer or whatever they have here," Daniel glanced up at Jack. The colonel looked back at the girl, not sure if it was worth it. They would be a man down carrying her, and she would probably be dead soon from her injuries.</p>
    <p>"Jack - "</p>
    <p>"Daniel - "</p>
    <p>"Jack, we are not leaving her here."</p>
    <p>O'Neill knew he was going to lose the argument if he even tried. "Daniel, once Carter gets her set, you carry her. Let's keep our eyes open, people. We don't want any nasty surprises."</p>
    <p>"I did not intend to close them, O'Neill," said Teal'c with a slight nod. Jack accepted the silent pledge with a nod of his own, then stood to get out of Carter's way. A few minutes later, they were ready to go again. The girl remained unconscious throughout.</p>
    <p>Following the path, it didn't take SG-1 long to find a gate to the outside world. It was unguarded and unlocked and led into a little courtyard filled with more machines and vehicles in various states of repair. O'Neill though it was deserted at first, but a sudden movement on his right caught his attention. As did the gun pointed at his chest two seconds later.</p>

  content: "Well, the Lord is pretty forgiving as a rule, but this was back in the old days, when he wasn't given to pussyfooting around, and things had gotten pretty corrupt in Sodom and Gomorrah - not to mention Admah, Zeboim, and Bela. The drinking, whoring and general depravity was bad enough, but what really set these guys apart was the way they trampled on their own. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Anyway, finally things got to a bad enough pass that the Lord sent me down with some of the boys to take care of things. Of course, these mud monkeys never can accept these things, and when Abaraham got wind of it he begged the Lord to reconsider. Well, at the time the Lord was thinking up this other plan, about being made flesh and all that, so he says if Abraham could find more than a handful of righteous souls in one of these cities then he'd think again on the wholesale smiting. He could only find the one, though - this guy Lot - so that was off.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    To do Lot justice, he was okay. When me and the boys went down to give him fair warning, the degenerates in Sodom got pretty interested. We used to pick good looking vessels, back in the day (well, some of us still do, but these days I go for inspiring respect rather than a pretty face). So, they came baying at the doors, asking for a piece of us. Lot, though, he knew his duty, and he wasn't going to insult the Lord like that. He offered up his daughters instead, mind you. Mud monkeys, they make no sense to me. \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Since Lot was a good sort, we got him and his people out of the city. Told them not to look back, too, because we were planning some pretty righteous smiting. Of course, there always has to be one who doesn't listen, and sure enough his wife had to turn back. Pillar of salted her: regrettable, but what can you do? People should follow instructions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So, we did some flattening of the city - fire, brimstone, the whole works. Some of the best fun I've had in eternity, I have to admit. Lot was well out of it, but those daughters of his took some fool notion to have a baby, and he was the only man around. So it goes. "

    Jared's a morning person.
    
    He loves the way every morning is like a brand new start - the way the day stretches out ahead of him, filled with promise. When he's up before the sun, the world seems to hold its breath, and anything feels possible.
    
    It's just as well Jared's a morning person, because Jensen really, really isn't.
    
    Jared slips carefully out from under Jensen's arm and quietly pulls on his clothes. It's Sunday, so he could afford to sleep in later, but after a hard week of shooting his body-clock is still wired to wake him up early, and he knows better than to try to go back to sleep.
    
    One of the good things about Jensen not being a morning person, though, is that Jared can kiss him goodbye without worrying about waking him. At this hour on a Sunday morning, Jensen is dead to the world, and it takes a lot more than Jared's lips grazing the corner of his mouth to wake him. Today, Jensen just sighs softly and buries deeper into his blankets.
    
    Jared smiles and slips out of Jensen's apartment.
    
    He has to be a morning person, really. He has two dogs which need to be walked, and with the schedule he keeps, early morning before the sun rises is the only real opportunity. He jogs through the streets with them, enjoying the peace, the way the pavements belong to him alone and no one is there to even notice him, let alone recognise him.
    
    Back at his apartment, he takes a long shower, enjoying the heat of the water against his skin and humming softly under his breath: some tune that's worked its way into his head, though he can't place it or think of the words. He might ask Jensen later, if it starts to bug him, but for now he's happy just to hum along and not think about it too much. He takes his time, shampoos his hair twice. It's Sunday, and Jensen won't be wanting to get up for hours yet. Jared's got plenty of time.
    
    The dogs are waiting for him when he finally emerges from the shower, so he wraps a towel around his waist and pads barefoot out to the kitchen to feed them, leaving damp footprints for a few steps on the hallway carpet. Once the dogs are satisfied, he towels off in his bedroom and hunts out some clean clothes to throw on. He could do to do some laundry, but it's Sunday and he doesn't want to waste his time on that, even if he won't have a chance to do any during the week.
    
    His hair's all damp and sticking up oddly, he notices as he passes a mirror on his way to the door. He runs a hand over it self-consciously, but decides against backtracking to find a comb. It'll probably just get messed up more when he goes outside, anyway, and it's not like he's going to meet anyone he knows at this time of day.
    
    The sun's coming up properly as Jared walks along the street. The grey colourlessness of the hour before dawn is giving way to faint gold and pink. Sometimes early mornings can fool you, but it looks like it's going to be a beautiful day.
    
    The shop on the corner of the street is opening, and Jared ducks in just long enough to buy syrup and flour: he's got a craving for pancakes, suddenly, his belly rumbling its demands. The woman behind the counter doesn't bat an eye at his hair, even though he's sure it's drying all weird, but he guesses she gets far weirder types, or maybe she's just happy to have any sale this early. He grins at her, either way, and drops his change into the charity collection box as he leaves.
    
    His key turns quietly in the lock, and he cocks his head to listen as he shuts the door behind him. The apartment is still silent, and he grins and dumps his bag of groceries in the kitchen, then kicks off his shoes and wanders through to the bedroom.
    
    Jensen's still where he left him, though he's kicked off one layer of blankets now, and Jared drinks in the sight of Jensen's exposed back, the line of his shoulder blade from where Jensen's got one arm flung out across the empty half of the bed. Jared wants to kiss his way down that shoulder blade, but Jensen looks so comfortable and peaceful that Jared doesn't want to wake him. Jensen doesn't get as much sleep as he needs, usually.
    
    Jared reached out for the top blanket and tugs it gently back up over Jensen, but he messes up somehow, because Jensen makes a sleepy, inquisitive sound and half-blinks his eyes open.
    
    "Hey," Jared murmurs. "Go back to sleep, I didn't mean to wake you, man."
    
    He's not sure Jensen is quite tracking yet, and his suspicion is confirmed when Jensen stretches out one hand for him, open and easy in a way he wouldn't be if he was fully awake. Jared can't resist that, leaning down with one knee balanced on the bed to kiss Jensen softly.
    
    "C'mon back to bed," Jensen murmurs sleepily when they separate, and pulls him down properly. "Way too early to get up." He shifts and tugs at the covers, and suddenly Jared finds himself enveloped in warm blankets and Jensen. Jensen's alreadly curling up against him, his eyes closed, and Jared doesn't really want to disturb him, so he turns his face into Jensen's hair and lets his eyes slip shut.
    
    Jared's a morning person, and Jensen's really not. But on days like this, Jared think that works out pretty well.

    Chapter 1: Homecoming</p>
    <p>*******************************</p>
    <p>Rhia bounced impatiently on the balls of her feet, swinging her arms in wild circles on either side of her body. Every few seconds she tore her eyes from the closed hanger doors to the empty clamshell, but each time, Pilot failed to materialize. Adults were so slow. Even Seth was faster, she thought as her brother ran into the maintenance bay, out of breath.</p>
    <p>" 'Ia! You said you wait!" he wailed.</p>
    <p>"I did!" Rhia protested. She'd waited *forever* in the corridor for him to catch up, but he'd kept not coming so she had gone on without him.</p>
    <p>"Did not! You said you would but you di'n't!" repeated Seth. He plopped down on the floor next to Rhia who had resumed her dance. What was *taking* so long? They were supposed to be here now. Rhia hated waiting. She wanted to be able to *do* something, anything to not have to wait. But she couldn't and that was worst of all. A whirring from the door finally broke the attending silence as Speckles and Stipes came in followed by the rest of the crew.</p>
    <p>"They here, Chi?" asked Seth twisting to look up at the Nebari.</p>
    <p>"Yep!" she answered, and the boy pushed himself to his feet.</p>
    <p>They were here, they were here at last! Rhia hopped from foot to foot as if it would make the doors open faster. "What's taking so long?!" she asked. She'd been waiting for this day since they had left, and now that it had come it seemed longer than the whole three and a half monens that they'd been gone.</p>
    <p>*Finally*, Pilot opened the doors, dench by agonizing dench. Rhia ran forward as soon as there was a large enough gap, Seth valiantly trying to keep up on shorter legs. Above them, the transport pod made its final approach. The two children intently watched it land, not even noticing the rest of the crew come up behind them. They had eyes only for the hatch, the descending steps, and the first two people down them.</p>
    <p>"Mama, Daddy!" they shrieked, racing forward. Rhia slammed into her mother as soon as she descended the last step and wrapped her arms around her waist. A moment later Mama's strong arms lifted her into a bone crushing hug. She was smiling broadly, so Rhia did too as she hung on with all her might and inhaled the leathery, tangy smell that was her mother. Nothing was wrong. Everything was perfect.</p>
    <p>"We missed you guys so much!" she heard Dad say with Seth wrapped in a similar hug, soft black leather hiding her brother from sight. After a quick kiss on the head, Mom helped her switch places with Seth.</p>
    <p>"How's my big girl?!" Dad asked holding tight. Rhia felt her chest wanting to explode from happiness. Mom was safe and smiling, Dad was safe and smiling and nothing else mattered. She wanted to stay in this hug forever.</p>
    <p>"Crichton," said Crais above them. Rhia looked and saw him and two other grinning Sebaceans waiting to disembark.</p>
    <p>"Sorry, Crais," Dad replied setting Rhia on her feet. Immediately she latched onto his big hand with both of hers and felt a reassuring squeeze. The reunited family moved out of the way to greet everyone else; Essor broke ranks and ran up for his own one-armed hugs from his aunt and uncle. Mama still held Seth on one hip while Rhia bounced next to Dad with a solar grin on her face.</p>
    <p>When they at last headed out of the hangar, Rhia snuck a look at D'argo who smiled and nodded. He'd made her promise to wait, but now it was okay.</p>
    <p>"Dad! Dad!" she tugged on the hand she held. "Guess what we found?"</p>
    <p>He looked down with a smile then pulled her up into his arms, letting her lean back so he could look at her. "The Swiss Family Robinson."</p>
    <p>"No," Rhia brushed away the strange answer. "Earth."</p>
    <p>Dad froze, the smile slipping as he stared at her. "You found what?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Earth. Your planet. I got to translate," said the little girl proudly. Dad looked at Mama who was just as shocked, then D'argo who nodded.</p>
    <p>"That's where our ... impossible starburst took us. We checked over the data spools and it looks like it was really there, " said Filalla.</p>
    <p>"Moya and I have the coordinates if you wish to return," added Pilot.</p>
    <p>Dad turned back to Rhia as a slow smile spread across his face.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"And I said everything exactly what D'argo said, except the bad words 'cause I can't say them till I'm big, and the Humans asked all sorts of questions - they're not very smart, but didn't shoot us like we thought - and they asked about me 'cause I could speak Human, and I can speak hynerian and some Nebari but not Luxan, but Chi had a feeling and wouldn't let them see me -"</p>
    <p>"An' I helpt fix tier 10," Seth interrupted his sister's retelling of the Earth encounter. They were on their way to Jool's quarters, one child on each side of Aeryn, to pick up their things. Dinner had been cheerful and carefully centered on Moya's encounter with Earth, mentioning only the general, child friendly account of Talyn's mission.</p>
    <p>"Did you? You'll have to show me later," Aeryn smiled.</p>
    <p>"I wasn't finished!" Rhia wailed impatiently, shaking the hand she held.</p>
    <p>Aeryn smiled even wider, reveling in the sound of her children's voices. "I'm listening, Rhia," she said and gave a squeeze to the hand firmly attached to hers.</p>
    <p>"They didn't get to see me but I got to see them and they look just like *Sebaceans*!"</p>
    <p>Aeryn wanted to laugh but held it in. "Your dad looks Sebacean," she pointed out.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, but these were *real* Humans," insisted Rhia and this time Aeryn didn't hold back, much to Rhia's perplexity. "What? What's so funny?"</p>
    <p>"I helpt fix tier 10!" Seth repeated, sticking to what he understood of the conversation. His bright eyed look of innocence made him look so much like John when he saw something amazing for the first time that Aeryn felt her breath catch. Giving in to the impulse, she dropped to her knees and pulled both of them into a hug they were more than happy to return, small fingers grabbing tightly to her shirt.</p>
    <p>"I love you both, you know that?" she told them, never wanting to let go. Her children. So much a part of her that she hurt when they hurt. Motherhood still surprised her sometimes but she wouldn't trade it for anything in the universe.</p>
    <p>"Love you too, Mama," "Love you," Rhia and Seth said back. Aeryn pulled away and met two blazing smiles with her own. She felt like she hadn't stopped smiling since they got back, and even though her cheeks were getting sore, she couldn't have stopped even if she wanted to.</p>
    <p>The rest of they way to Jool's quarters was bliss for the ex-Peacekeeper. Rhia continued her disjointed narrative with Seth interrupting every few microts to remind her that he'd helped fix tier 10, just in case she forgot. While their foray into Scarran territory had allowed her and John some time alone, Aeryn had missed the children. She missed playing with them in the morning, teaching Rhia self defense, even the screaming fits at bath time.</p>
    <p>"Sounds like you had a busy few monens," she commented when Rhia finally paused for breath.</p>
    <p>"We were *good,* Mama!" said her daughter so earnestly that Aeryn was immediately suspicious.</p>
    <p>"Good, huh? Are you sure there were no little mishaps? No one thrown out the airlock?"</p>
    <p>Rhia glanced at her feet guiltily then looked back and blurted, "The shelf was Seth's fault!"</p>
    <p>"Was not!"</p>
    <p>"He wanted to see the mold on the ceiling!"</p>
    <p>"You melted my plate!" Seth shouted back.</p>
    <p>"You ate Rygel's food!"</p>
    <p>"I was hiding from a Scarran and hadn't eaten for *days.*"</p>
    <p>Aeryn glanced sharply at her son, hoping he was talking about one of his games since no one had mentioned an attack. Seth's face was red as he and Rhia continued to shout each other's transgressions and Aeryn regretted ever opening this can of mardjools. "I'm sure you both helped clean up your messes, didn't you?" she interrupted over them, giving each her no-nonsense look. They quieted and nodded. "Good," she squeezed their hands and smiled again. "Then let's get your things back home."</p>
    <p>Grinning and immediately forgetting the fight, the two scampered into Jool's brightly decorated room pulling Aeryn with them. There wasn't much to pack up. The kids only had a few sets each of clothes, most dyed or painted bright colors. More numerous were the toys: coloring sticks and paper, blocks and puzzles fashioned from worn out mechanical parts, molded cestern from Moya's sealant glands folded into ships and animals, and various other trinkets picked up cheap, or in some cases stolen, on commerce planets. Both children kept pulling Aeryn over to see new pictures and contraptions they'd made, many unrecognizable from the objects they represented.</p>
    <p>Jool came in with another sack by the time they finished pulling everything together. "From the others' quarters," she explained, pouring the contents into the toy bag. Aeryn watched with a mixture of gratitude and uncertainty. For the past couple of cycles she hadn't really known what to make of Jool. Normally they treated each other with grudging respect bordering on friendship. The Interion had both changed and not changed from the stuck up brat John had brought back from the ice planet. She was still arrogant and often whined and complained, but she held up in a crisis with more backbone than Aeryn had first thought possible. Then there were the little touches of concern that seemed to come flying out of nowhere, like the offer to help with the kids while she and John were gone.</p>
    <p>"I hear they gave you a hard time," said Aeryn needing to fill the silence as she fastened the bag closed. Rhia and Seth were wrestling with the clothes bag on the bed.</p>
    <p>Jool rolled her eyes, the picture of a long suffering babysitter. "I am never giving them a bath again," she said seriously. "Never."</p>
    <p>The mental image of Jool shrieking and stomping her feet in frustration as the kids ran circles around her made Aeryn grin and the uncomfortableness fade. As much as she loved the children, Jool had always had trouble controlling them, though she was learning. "I understand. Thank you, for taking care of them." Jool smiled back.</p>
    <p>"Glad I could help. But I'm serious about the bath thing," she added, a slightly panicked expression on her face as if Aeryn might think her willingness to help would transfer to the dreaded chore.</p>
    <p>"I know." Aeryn turned to her two monsters, "Ready to go?"</p>
    <p>They nodded then ran to give Jool a hug. With a cheerful see-you-in-the-morning, they headed three tiers down towards home.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"I don't believe it," John muttered for the hundredth time. But this time D'argo heard the beginnings of hope color his friend's voice. It was late and the two of them were in the cargo bay looking over the remaining Earth food. After supper John had gone over the data spools with Pilot for himself, searching for any sign of a trap, another trick to steal the wormhole knowledge out of his brain. But he hadn't found any. Any being with the power to push an already exhausted leviathan into a second starburst would have more efficient ways of gleaning the information. At least that's what they hoped.</p>
    <p>"What's it been? Nine cycles, ten?" the Human asked absently as he ran a gentle hand over the earth lettering.</p>
    <p>"Something like that," D'argo shrugged. It was hard to tell sometimes - births, deaths, imprisonment, countless battles, it all ran together. "Pilot knows."</p>
    <p>"Yeah." John circled the crates, a look of mild wonder lighting up his face that reminded D'argo of their first cycle together on Moya. He had underestimated John then. Now he looked back and was amazed he had ever thought the Human weak. Bizarre, yes, always bizarre, but never weak.</p>
    <p>"You know," John quietly broke the silence, "Since Scorpy and the war, I've always wondered if I'd ever find Earth again, wondered if I dared to open another wormhole to go home and get away from this frelling galaxy."</p>
    <p>"I'd thought you'd given up searching," said D'argo surprised. John had barely mentioned wormhole research or his home planet for cycles.</p>
    <p>"No. Just had other things to worry about," the Human gave him a sad smile, weariness mixing with his natural good humor. "The Nebari took another planet in Known Space, despite two victories by the Front. I don't know which one."</p>
    <p>"I'm not surprised," the Luxan sighed. The United Front of Planets formed against the Nebari Takeover had been barely holding its own for the past four cycles. "Most of their governments had barely gotten the Nebari under control when the Peacekeepers pulled out to fight the Scarrans. Without the military support and the Uncharteds going to all hezmana, it's amazing the Front's lasted this long."</p>
    <p>"Thanks to the Resistance, which by the way, is still trying to pull itself back together. At this rate the Peacekeepers will be forced to split their forces soon if they don't want the Nebari to bite their supply lines in the ass. And the Scarrans are just having a grand ol' time razing planets for resources while the Anti Scarran-Whatever-They're-Calling-Themselves here are still arguing over who's got the biggest balls." John sighed crossing his arms as he leaned against a crate. "It's really getting nasty out there."</p>
    <p>"It was already nasty," D'argo told him wryly, depressed by the news. The web of war on two fronts trapped nothing but death. Chemical and biological weapons decimated the inferior populations that stood in the way of the major players, nothing more than resources and labor forces to be exploited, while those with the technology picked their own wars or tried to fight back in an alliance that was more concerned with not killing its own allies first. And the refugees flowed like blood, carted to dubious safety by a couple handfuls of rogue ships like Moya and Talyn.</p>
    <p>"Yeah. Nasty. And now there might be Earth." John didn't need to say more. Looking at each other, they both knew that there would be no mercy for the homeworld of the infamous John Crichton.</p>
    <p>"Earth," D'argo repeated, the weight of the word settling like a black blanket over them. "You know your Humans talk a lot," the practical warrior shoved it away. John laughed and the Luxan grinned at the sound. The dark mood broken, they headed out of the cargo bay. "Hopelessly primitive," D'argo continued teasing. "Frankly I don't know how you ever became the most feared creature in the territories."</p>
    <p>"Watch it, D. If you're not careful I'll launch my super-ultra-top-secret weapon and you'll never sleep again. Mwaaaaaaaah."</p>
    <p>D'argo rolled his eyes, "Not you too." The grin John gave him was pure mischief. "Chiana trained her to wake *me* up every morning. That child does not have a healthy sense of fear."</p>
    <p>"Sure she does," John laughed. "She knows that if Pip says she'll whup her butt she will. You, my friend, are nothin' but a big pussy cat. And Rhia knows it."</p>
    <p>"I am not a puppy cat," D'argo snorted.</p>
    <p>"Wrapped around her tiny finger," the Human disagreed. They rounded a corner heading for quarters. "How were they?"</p>
    <p>"I think Rygel made a list."</p>
    <p>"Forget I asked. No, scratch that and give me the Reader's Digest version. Don't want any surprises. Seth didn't start any more fungus farms, did he?"</p>
    <p>It was D'argo's turn to laugh, "I don't think so. He's taken to disappearing into the access conduits - don't worry Stipes keeps up, and he hasn't fallen in the Den or anything, though it's not for lack of trying."</p>
    <p>"D'argo, you leave the details out of the Reader's Digest version," John gave him a pained look.</p>
    <p>"No broken bones."</p>
    <p>"Oh, God," the Human moaned. D'argo grinned even wider, enjoying himself.</p>
    <p>"Let see. Seth ate one of Rygel's food stashes; Rhia decided to cook supper without telling anyone and melted several plates; Pilot kicked them out of the Den -"</p>
    <p>"What?" John interrupted with a hand flung across his friend's chest. "Pilot, Mr. Residual-I'm-That-That-Baby's-Father Pilot?"</p>
    <p>D'argo pushed the hand away, grinning again at the memory of Pilot's chemically induced amnesia. The event actually hadn't been that pleasant. Aeryn, in the last stage of pregnancy with Rhia, had had to fly Moya and manage what systems she could while Pilot unconsciously sent the DRD's after the rest of them to protect "his" child she carried. And that was before Aeryn went into labor. D'argo was still amazed Pilot had survived with all his limbs attached. "You'll have to ask him, I heard about it from Jool."</p>
    <p>"I don't think I want to know what would push Pilot to that extreme," John ran one hand through his hair, the other resting on his hip. And he had only just got back. D'argo had absolutely no sympathy.</p>
    <p>As they turned down John and Aeryn's tier, D'argo could hear Aeryn humming softly. It was one of John's songs, and Seth's favorite. They passed the kids' room on the right, turning into John and Aeryn's on the left where the ex-Peacekeeper sat in bed with Rhia and Seth curled up asleep against her. She smiled when she saw them but didn't stop humming. John had eyes only for her. Smiling himself, D'argo gently clapped the Human on the shoulder and left his friend to his family.</p>
    <p>*****************************</p>
    <p>Chapter 2: Brave New World</p>
    <p>*****************************</p>
    <p>It was a beautiful day: blue sky and not a cloud in sight. Hot as hell, even for August but from the air conditioned Oval Office, President Landers could enjoy it. He was just back from lunch with his wife and was waiting on his aide Lewis Sheinson who was running late with his afternoon schedule. Landers didn't mind. It was nice to have a private moment to himself to get his thoughts in order. And take an Excedren for the headache he knew he was going to have in an hour, he thought wryly. Nevertheless he was doing just that when Lewis rushed in, out of breath but not a hair out of place, with the blue folder in hand.</p>
    <p>"Excuse me for being late, sir. Traffic," he explained.</p>
    <p>"Breathe, Lewis," Landers ordered with a smile. Young and an idealist at heart, Lewis was nonetheless the best aide Landers had ever had in his twenty years in politics. He was practical and highly efficient, full of gossip from just about every government building on Capitol Hill which he was never reluctant to share with the President. When he had first started out as a junior aide, Lewis had taken to penciling in notes on schedules and memos he delivered to the office. At first Landers hadn't known what to make of the illegible handwriting but after a few conversations and quiet inquiries, he made sure that Lewis was by his side after the job shuffle at Christmas.</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir," Lewis smiled back shyly. He handed Landers the folder and settled into the left-hand chair across from him with his palm pilot. Taking a few deep breaths, he got down to business. "You're in for a long afternoon, I'm afraid," he began. "At 1:30 you have a briefing with Secretary of State Clermont and General Ferrand from the Pentagon." Landers nodded. That would be the latest embassy attack in Pakistan and probably the new counteroffer for the Arms Treaty.</p>
    <p>"At 3:00, Mike Optim from the CIA and Jacob Norris from the FBI with the terrorist investigation. It's bad news; Secretary Wheeler had a cow this morning after Norris called him. He asked to be included in the briefing so he'll be here, too." Landers felt the headache coming on already, just behind his eyes. It was a well known fact that Optim and Norris didn't like each other, which meant that a meeting with the two of them was serious. His Secretary of Homeland Defense having cows did not inspire much confidence either.</p>
    <p>"I rescheduled Senator Kyleck of the Budget Committee," the conservatives asking for another tax cut that the government's programs could definitely do without, "for next Thursday to give you more time. I also moved your meeting with Locher from IASA to tomorrow." And that would be the new IASA treaty with Russia, the EU, and Japan. About the aliens who at this moment were hardly more than an abstract idea to Landers.</p>
    <p>"That it?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Tonight you have a black tie dinner with the Party to drum up support for the midterm elections."</p>
    <p>"I know. Any special reason you're bringing that up now?" Knowing Lewis, there was probably a good one.</p>
    <p>The young man nodded. "Rumor has it both Keats and Tyler will be there. Pressure from the Environmentalists about the Colorado issue. Just thought you might need the extra warning."</p>
    <p>"Thanks," Landers' sigh was heartfelt. Once upon a time he cared about the environment but right now it was barely a concern. At least he wouldn't be walking into an ambush. "Ask Richard to go over the numbers and give me something justifiable to say. I don't want Keats throwing dereliction in my face again." Lewis nodded not bothering to make a note. "Now, what do I need to know about the latest developments in Pakistan?"</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Florida was officially nicknamed the Sunshine State, but in hurricane season, it often felt far from it. Francis had just missed Canaveral by hours mostly dissipating before hitting near Jacksonville and leaving them the relatively gentle gift of tempest storms. Storms matched by the frustrated tempers of the IASA scientists trying to unravel hopelessly incomplete information from the alien ship. In the Shepard Building, the Farscape team was working on the faster-than-light "hetch" drive, trying to figure out what exactly the energy source was for that kind of power since "serrin" didn't translate.</p>
    <p>"I feel like Ptolomy trying to piece together astrophysics in Japanese," Yora Maganova threw her pencil down in frustration. "They totally cheated us with the questions! Legitimately answering them but in useless terms so we end up knowing less than we did in the beginning!"</p>
    <p>"Have you heard the xenobiology section?" asked Conrad Murphy, one of the astronauts on the team. "It's even worse than ours. One word in twenty is English."</p>
    <p>"DK, you think we'll ever get this mess sorted out?" Jeff Leacore asked, gesturing at the long table covered in periodic tables, data charts, and sheets and sheets of scratch paper. Looking at the trail of complex equations in both physics and chemistry, DK shrugged.</p>
    <p>"It's a whole different way of thinking. Unless the aliens come back, we'll probably never understand it," he said. As much as they wanted to. To be honest, the novelty of the aliens' visit was long gone, replaced by frustration and more than a little resentment that once the trade agreement was concluded, the aliens had refused to return any of Earth's transmissions before finally leaving. That was another mystery: why had they hung around if they didn't want to talk? Looked like they would never find that out either.</p>
    <p>"Why don't we give this hetch drive another week, than get back to more productive work?" he asked in general. "If we can't find anything useful we might as well give it back to Danny." From the grateful smiles, DK knew his people were more than ready to consign this stuff to a museum, but first they'd give it one last shot.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Melanie Crichton Phillipson switched off the TV in disgust, not wanting to hear anymore about the glory of God or incredible scientific breakthroughs. "You'd think people would have more sense," she said crossing to the kitchen where her husband was making coffee.</p>
    <p>"About what? The aliens?" Ryan asked. He leaned against the counter across from her next to the coffee maker, his gray shirt speckled with Peter's rejected dinner. Their two boys were asleep now, despite four year old David's protests that he wasn't tired.</p>
    <p>"There's the Roswell contingent still proclaiming the aliens as the saviors of Humanity and another religious fanatic calling for burning them at the stake for witchcraft. Like he could get his hands on them. *If* they even exist."</p>
    <p>"They released the contact tapes and the radar data. I'd say that's pretty irrefutable proof right there," said Ryan.</p>
    <p>Melanie gave him a withering glare. "This is the US government were talking about. If you recall, they aren't exactly forthright when it comes to
    videotapes."</p>
    <p>"You still believe that conspiracy theory of the '04 bombing?"</p>
    <p>"There is supporting evidence, you know. And it's not that I believe all of it, I'm just not discounting it. But aliens, Ry?"</p>
    <p>"I thought you talked to your Dad and he said this was the real deal," Ryan steered clear of the old argument.</p>
    <p>Melanie rolled her eyes. "My dad. My dad is a 70 year old dreamer. His head's always been stuck up in the stars. Hell, he missed half my life because of them."</p>
    <p>"You don't believe in aliens because Jack does," Ryan snorted. "You have one warped conception of logic for a computer analyst, Mel."</p>
    <p>"I'm just saying that he wants to believe in them so he takes them at face value. I'm not discounting the possibility that this is all an elaborate hoax. They had an English speaker for Christ's sake. How do you explain that?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know. But why would anyone want to fake an alien encounter?" Ryan argued.</p>
    <p>"For kicks? Entertainment? There are a lot of weird people out there who would love to do it."</p>
    <p>"On this scale?" Ryan asked. "You're saying some random Star Trek nerd faked out both IASA and the US government?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know!" Melanie shrugged. "But it's the more likely explanation."</p>
    <p>"Mel, you just don't *want* to believe," Ryan shook his head. The coffee done, he poured two cups and handed one to his wife. She took it quietly, staring into its bitter depths before taking a sip.</p>
    <p>"Nothing good ever came of space," she remarked.</p>
    <p>"I don't believe you!" Ryan burst out. "You're an astronaut's daughter and you still hate him for it."</p>
    <p>"What's there to like? Strangers knew him better than I did," Melanie said, waving a hand for emphasis. "Then he went and infected John with his dreams of space and aliens. Where did that get him? Dead!"</p>
    <p>"I don't think that's fair. From what I've heard, your brother wasn't other people's puppet. He wouldn't have become an astronaut if he hadn't loved it."</p>
    <p>"Maybe so," she conceded, "but he still went into space and never came back. Being a 'hero' or a 'scientific martyr' or 'space pioneer' doesn't make him any less dead."</p>
    <p>Ryan sipped his coffee and didn't reply. He'd never met his late brother-in-law. Melanie had been dating Steven Whirel, her future first husband, when he had died. She had been close to John, he knew, despite the six years between them, and it had taken her a long time to get over his death. She didn't speak to Jack for almost three years and even now that they were talking, they weren't really talking.</p>
    <p>"So what are the scientists saying?" he finally broke the silence.</p>
    <p>"Same old, same old. The answers are incomplete, lots of alien terms and concepts, though they say they're making progress deciphering them."</p>
    <p>"More fuel for the unbelieving."</p>
    <p>"Just don't be disappointed when they don't come back." She took another sip of coffee. Ryan watched, amazed again at how rational thought flew out the window when space was mentioned.</p>
    <p>"Melanie, why don't you believe in the aliens?" he asked.</p>
    <p>She smiled. "You sound like you're asking me if I believe in God." Ryan smiled back but didn't say anything, his expression telling her that he wanted to know and understand. Melanie looked down into her coffee, the smile fading. "I can't," she finally said, not looking up. After a moment she continued. "They...they never found any wreckage. Of John's ship." She looked up and Ryan could see the pain in her eyes. It was hard to bury an empty box. Without a thought he set his mug down and gathered her into his arms, running a soothing hand up and down her back.</p>

    <p>Chiana snaked an arm around the slug's throat and pinched his mouth closed, harder than necessary. She wasn't irritated enough to through him out an airlock, but she was getting close. Ever since they'd entered John's system he hadn't stopped bitching about the Humans. She swore if he mentioned dissection one more time... "Rygel, shut the frell up!"</p>
    <p>"Thank you!" Emmerit sighed in relief, rubbing her temples to no doubt ease the headache caused by listening to Rygel's non-stop doomsaying.</p>
    <p>Rygel was doing his best to bite Chiana's hand, but cycles of practice had perfected the grip. After a few microts of lip-twitching he finally gave up. However Chiana's laugh of triumph quickly turned into a shriek of horror when a warm spray hit her leg. Violently, she flung Rygel away from her, too disgusted to even take pleasure from the satisfying thwack he made against the wall of the center chamber. The little toad had pissed on her! A self satisfied chuckle floated up from the lump on the floor, fuelling the Nebari's anger. The frelling little piece of dren had pissed on her!</p>
    <p>With a scream she launched herself toward the dethroned dominar, intent on ripping him to pieces. She would have succeeded too if Emmerit hadn't gotten in her way and bodily moved her out the door.</p>
    <p>"Chiana! Stop!" Emmerit yelled, catching at her flailing arms. Chiana tried to kick, scratch, anything, but the older woman held her fast until she was safely in the corridor. "You'll hate yourself in the morning!"</p>
    <p>"No, I won't! He pissed on me!"</p>
    <p>"You're acting like a child!"</p>
    <p>"He pissed on me!!!" Did that count for nothing? She'd been doing Emmerit a favor by shutting him up. And when the frelling little fiskerbot *peed* on her, she was reprimanded like Essor! Right, so she was acting like Essor in a tantrum, Chiana could admit that, but Rygel still needed to be skinned slowly after an acid bath.</p>
    <p>"Chiana, just go clean up," Emmerit lowered her voice. "I'll go hide his thronesled." That surprised a bark of laughter from the Nebari, dispelling her anger somewhat as she imagined all twenty-six denches of Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth waddling around on his own two stumps of feet.</p>
    <p>"You better hurry," she replied twisting to look over Emmerit's shoulder into the center chamber. With the threat gone, Rygel had pulled himself to his feet and was starting to make his way to the table to climb back into his thronesled that still hovered in the air.</p>
    <p>"Go. You smell like...well, piss. I'll take care of his royal shortness," Emmerit gave her a gentle push down the corridor. Confident, that Rygel was in the appropriate hands, Chiana headed up the tier towards quarters with a wholesome smile on her face.</p>
    <p>She liked Emmerit. The woman had been a barkeep on her planet's space station for about fifty cycles and knew plenty of ways to take revenge without actually resorting to violence. In fact, the battle against the Peacekeepers for control of the space station had been the first time she had ever killed anyone. Emmerit and her pilot friend Edinnal had managed to get away in the flotsam of escaping or dead vessels and ended up on the same commerce planet as Moya. Aside from Aeryn almost getting killed, it had been a peaceful encounter and their passage to another planet, like Chiana's, had turned into a permanent stay.</p>
    <p>Chiana's smile slipped as she thought about it. It been about a cycle since Edinnal was killed. He'd made her laugh.</p>
    <p>Refusing to think morbid thoughts this close to another potential death-trap, Chiana entered her quarters, wondering if she had anything clean left to wear. The three weekens of time between starbursts to John's planet had been spent patching up Moya's reopened wounds. And that was after a hectic two and a half monens dealing with Zenetian pirates, a small arms carrier who swore he had nothing to do with the influx of Charrids in the region, and a spectacularly bad choice in commerce planets. It left little time for laundry.</p>
    <p>"Morning, Chiana," a sleepy voice said from her bed. Looking over, the Nebari was not surprised to see Medri lying there, eyes barely opened and looking sexy as always. Her souvenir from the two cycles she spent with the Nebari Resistance after the Takeover.</p>
    <p>Medri smiled as she sashayed over to the bed, eyes opening wider with every step. Then his nostrils twitched and the smile broke into a grin. "What happened to you?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Rygel." Mood broken, Chiana looked over herself disgustedly then headed for the shelf on the back wall. She didn't need to explain further.</p>
    <p>"Dissection?"</p>
    <p>Chiana nodded sifting through the small pile of dirty clothes. "Emm's hiding his thronesled," she answered his next question. She heard him get out of bed behind her and knew without looking that his spots had dropped from muted yellow to dark gold. A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth as she slowly turned around. "I need to go check on Essor after I change," she teased.</p>
    <p>"Essor's fine wherever he is. You need to take a shower," Medri countered stepping closer.</p>
    <p>"Do I?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, you do."</p>
    <p>"You know if you kiss me you're going to need a shower too."</p>
    <p>"Will I?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, you will."</p>
    <p>They were barely apart, so close Chiana could feel his body heat, but still not touching. Medri only wore the light pants he slept in, his large, now gold spots decorating his upper body. His species also came in blue spots - a genetic fact that left the planet in a constant state of civil war - but Chiana much preferred the yellow. Or maybe it was just him, she thought as his spots dropped another shade and she caught the glint of both humor and hunger in his eye that made her heart flutter.</p>
    <p>"We better go take a shower," she said, her breath catching slightly.</p>
    <p>"Should we?" His steady voice was at odds with his all-telling colors.</p>
    <p>Chiana grinned and closed the gap. "Yes, we should."</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>John had never realized just how huge Jupiter was until Moya was flying by it. The planet was abso-frickin-normus! John had seen gas giants before, but none had ever seemed so large. And the weird thing was that he knew it. Every orange and white stripe and the red spot glaring from the southern hemisphere like a watchful eye. But at the same time, the familiarity itself was odd.</p>
    <p>However it was the constellations that made him start. The patterns of stars he was so used to barely recognizing, suddenly oriented into figures so instinctive it made his chest ache. They were just pricks of light, gazillions of years old from other suns, yet steeped in Earth's ancient myths and legends. They'd seen empire's rise and civilizations fall, granted wishes and fuelled the hopes and dreams of Humanity for the long of its existence. His own innocent dreams.</p>
    <p>It felt surreal, and he found himself waiting for the other shoe to drop - Ancients, Peacekeepers, Scarrans, Farders, Nebari, or something else God-awful and new. It seemed too good to be true, and John distrusted that above all, yet all the evidence screamed it was real.</p>
    <p>Footsteps behind him caught his attention, and after a moment he relaxed, recognizing them as Aeryn's. She came up beside him, letting her shoulder touch his in silence. Her mere presence was reassuring, the stable center of his universe no matter which corner of it he might be in.</p>
    <p>"Your solar system," she said quietly. John looked at her. Her hair was in its usual tight braid, and her thoughts were hidden behind a neutral expression. But he could feel the tension through their contact. They'd only had one real conversation about Earth in the past couple monens, but now John wished he had made time for one more.</p>
    <p>"Earth's solar system," he said taking her hand and never looking away from her. When she finally met his eyes with her own, he added, "To final, irrevocable death do us part, Aeryn." He watched the corners of her mouth turn up slightly. The tension eased from her body at their marriage vow. As he held her eyes, John couldn't help but marvel that as much as she had changed and grown from the Peacekeeper she once had been, so much had stayed the same. She still needed to know that he would be there tomorrow.</p>
    <p>As if she knew what he was thinking, she squeezed his hand and said, "Now that we've dealt with my insecurities," John half-grinned at her self mockery, "are you all right? You've been up here since mealtime."</p>
    <p>He shrugged and looked back at the viewscreen. "Just some rattlers rearin' their ugly heads."</p>
    <p>"Second thoughts?"</p>
    <p>"Nah," John said, though he himself wasn't sure. He'd felt torn since he'd first seen Cassiopeia. Part of him was wildly excited about finding Earth, like returning from summer camp when he was a kid full of wild tales but ready to go home. He missed his family, his old life, and everything familiar. But there was deeper, darker part of him born on the other side of the wormhole that was scared shitless. "It's just...I've been gone so long and now I'm back," he finally said. "So much has happened...I'm not the same person I was when I was pulled aboard Moya."</p>
    <p>"None of us are," said Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"No." He looked down at their joined hands. "With everything ... everyone whose been through my head..." he trailed off trying to form a coherent thought. "I don't even know what to *say* to them."</p>
    <p>"You'll find the words," Aeryn said. "You always do. Even for your father."</p>
    <p>John looked up with a wry grin at the woman who knew him all too well. She held his eyes easily. Yeah, his father, he finally admitted in his mind, the only person whose opinion mattered. "You've never met my real Dad."</p>
    <p>Aeryn smiled at that and stepped in front of him to grab his other hand, blocking John's view of the screen. "The man your father raised is still part of you," she said, twining her fingers with his.</p>
    <p>It was John's turn to raised uncertain eyes to her reassuring gaze. "You sure about that?" he asked. In many ways John felt... unclean. There was so much blood on his hands and worst of all, most of it he didn't regret. Peacekeepers, Scarrans, countless others who'd tried to catch him to have their way with the knowledge in his brain - or simply kill him. It was survival fuelled by anger, not just for what they did to him, but for what they did to entire planets, what they did to their own people, what they had done to his friends and family. It wasn't something he was proud of, but there it was. How could he face his father as he was now?</p>
    <p>"Yes," Aeryn answered as if it were that simple. "You still willingly risk your life for total strangers because it's the right thing to do. That has never changed, John, and probably never will." She stared into his eyes a moment before continuing. "What has changed is that you've gotten better at it. You're not nearly as much of a half-wit as you were before. I guess that would make you a three-quarters-wit," she added after a pause.</p>
    <p>He laughed lightly. Trust Aeryn to cheer him up, compliment him, and insult him all at the same time. "When did you get to be so wise?" he asked leaning forward till their foreheads met.</p>
    <p>"About the time I fell in love with a certain drannit who insisted on saving my life."</p>
    <p>"Hmm. Anyone I know?" he teased.</p>
    <p>"Oh, I don't know," she teased back, smiling. "From a backward species? Never shuts up, smells like a moonkey, doesn't know when to frelling kiss me -" Aeryn's words were suddenly cut off by John's mouth occupying hers. He could take a hint. She smiled against his lips as he kissed her long and slowly.</p>
    <p>"Nope, don't know him," he said when they finally came up for air.</p>
    <p>"Don't you two ever do anything else?" a disgusted grunt came from the door as D'argo entered.</p>
    <p>Unembarrassed, John and Aeryn grinned at each other. "Oh, yeah!" John breathed, knowing Aeryn was thinking exactly the same thing he was. He leaned in for another kiss. Behind them, he could hear D'argo muttering something about knowing way to much about their sex life. Moya was, John thought absently as he lost himself in the sensations of the kiss, only so big after all.</p>
    <p>They were passing over the asteroid belt by the time, John and Aeryn finally settled against the strategy table to watch their progress, shoulders again comfortably touching. The rattlers had calmed somewhat, taking the edge off the fear. Then John saw Earth in the distance. It really hit him then that this could be it: no wormhole, no 'waking' from a dream or crash. Moya had brought them here by blood and sweat, starburst and hetch. Unless Harvey was playing games again - which he couldn't - that was Earth. Gaia, Terra Firma, Mostly Harmless, the 3rd Rock from the Sun.</p>
    <p>As they drew closer, the others drifted in. "See Dad? That's Earth!" said Rhia, as if she could read his thoughts. He half turned and watched her haul herself onto the strategy table for a better view. Seth tried too, but he was still too small, so instead he ducked under the table to John's side and tugged on his leather pants.</p>
    <p>"Up!" he commanded holding out his arms. John smiled and obediently picked up his son, settling him in the crook of his arm facing forward so he could see. His light weight resting against John's chest sent a wave of warmth through him. Yes, life out here had been frelling awful from time to time, he thought, but it had also been pretty wonderful too. He had a family here, he'd seen some pretty cool things, and he'd known some very amazing people.</p>
    <p>"Can we go there?" Seth asked, pointing to the blue orb.</p>
    <p>"No. Everyone's staying on Moya until we know it's safe," answered John.</p>
    <p>"But I want to go!" Rhia whined from Aeryn's other side. "We *never* get to go anywhere!"</p>
    <p>"Rhia, none of us are going down until it's safe so I don't want to hear another word about it," Aeryn admonished gently.</p>
    <p>"But -"</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>John grimaced. The kids really didn't get a chance to go rockside very often; it was too dangerous. A trip to a relatively calm commerce planet was like going to the circus, a special event that was the highlight of the cycle. He felt guilty that his own home planet was on the look-don't-touch list, but what choice did they have?</p>
    <p>"Why can't we go there?" asked Seth.</p>
    <p>"Because the Humans aren't used to aliens and might want to hurt us," John answered.</p>
    <p>"Why?"</p>
    <p>"Because we're different and they're sometimes afraid of things that are different."</p>
    <p>"Why?"</p>
    <p>Whoever invented the word deserved to be shot, John decided. "They just are."</p>
    <p>"You're not afraid of different things," the three-year-old said with all the confidence of his age. John exchanged a look with Aeryn, wondering what to say to that when Rhia beat him to it.</p>
    <p>"That's because he's not a Earth Human."</p>
    <p>"Oh." Seth, satisfied by this answer, lapsed back into silence. There was a certain logic to that, John supposed, but he didn't want to think about it.</p>
    <p>Time was frozen in space, the Earth neither growing larger nor smaller, just there. He'd waited so long, but so much had changed...well, the rattlers were speaking for themselves. All of a sudden it seemed, John could make out the craters on the moon then the satellites in orbit and the space station. The international space station that he had helped build - the solar panels on the main module to be exact. John remembered it like a dream from another life jolting him awake.</p>
    <p>"The Humans have noticed us," Pilot spoke up from the clamshell. "They are sending us a transmission, audio and visual."</p>
    <p>The center of the viewscreen changed from Earth to three men in suits and ties. "Starship Moya, do you copy?... This is Jeremy Seymore of the Planet Earth."</p>
    <p>And John couldn't help it; he laughed, dispelling his uncertainty and fear. It wasn't just the "starship" straight from Gene Roddenberry but -</p>
    <p>"What?" Seth tilted his head back.</p>
    <p>"Jeremy Seymore wearing a suit and tie!" Now that was something that would never have come out of his brain. He shook his head and passed his son to Aeryn who moved out of the field of vision.</p>
    <p>"You know him?" asked D'argo warily.</p>
    <p>John nodded and reigned his features back to half grin. "Okay Pilot, Odysseus has returned."</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Transmitting now."</p>
    <p>"Hey Jeremy, how much they pay you to wear the suit?" John asked casually. The look on Jeremy's face was priceless. John could practically see the blood drain from his face. His two companion however went red from mounting anger.</p>
    <p>"Who is this?!" demanded the one on the left.</p>
    <p>Time to drop the bomb. "John Crichton. IASA Astronaut Corps. I went MIA sometime back in '99."</p>
    <p>"I'm not here to play games!" Leftie scowled. "How did you get on this frequency?!"</p>
    <p>"I'm not playing games either," John replied. "I'm on Moya. Check your feedback."</p>
    <p>"John?" Jeremy whispered hoarsely.</p>
    <p>John, who'd seen his own share of ghosts back from the dead, suddenly felt sorry for him. "Yeah, it's me, Jeremy. I'm alive."</p>
    <p>"But you're dead."</p>
    <p>Leftie, watching the exchange, glanced sharply at Jeremy then back at John. "Mr...Crichton is it? If you are really on Moya, where are the aliens we saw before?"</p>
    <p>"They're here. D'argo or someone wanna wave hello?" John turned in time to see his Luxan friend roll his eyes. Nevertheless, the big lug moved beside him into the field of vision.</p>
    <p>"Stupid Humans," he grumbled.</p>
    <p>"That do for proof?" John asked. Leftie and Rightie exchanged a look. Jeremy was still in denial.</p>
    <p>"We would like some time to look into the matter. We'll contact Moya again in half an hour," Leftie finally said.</p>
    <p>Made sense. Give them a chance to figure out what to think. "Half an arn, then." The screen blinked out, back to the blue and white marble floating in space. Everything looked so simple from up here, John thought. Nice and uncomplicated - just a planet.</p>
    <p>For the next few minutes, John absently answered Rhia's questions about Earth's reaction. He didn't notice when she finally scampered off with the boys to more exciting things. His mind's eye had captured his attention with memories of Jeremy, IASA, and the handful of insane recreations he'd been through since he left. The Ancients had come the closest of all of them, but it hadn't been perfect. With all the others there had been the same song and dance around wormholes. But this was it, or as close as he was going to get to believing it. And it scared him like nothing had before because he wanted it to be true.</p>
    <p>It seemed like only microts had passed when Pilot informed them that the Humans were back on the line. John took a moment to center himself. Sometime during the interim Aeryn's hand had tangled with his; she gave him a tight but nonetheless reassuring smile.</p>
    <p>"We're just talking," she reminded him.</p>
    <p>"Got it."</p>
    <p>A moment later Jeremy was back with Leftie and Rightie. He'd recovered some of his color, but still looked a little worse for wear. "Mr. Crichton," Leftie took control of the conversation. "We have confirmed your signal coming from Moya and the Lux-an as the same one we saw before. You will have to forgive us if we remain skeptical as to your identity."</p>
    <p>"Fine. I probably wouldn't believe it was me either. But just for the record, I'm not a mind-reader or brain-sucker or whatever else you can think of. If I was I wouldn't waste my time with letting you doubt me. So can we just pretend to believe in each other until we have further evidence?"</p>
    <p>Leftie blinked but quickly recovered from John's bald speech. He found himself beginning to like the guy. "Very well. We will accept that you are John Crichton for the time being and you will accept...?"</p>
    <p>"That you're a Human on Earth and not a figment of my imagination." That got a reaction. Jeremy started to sputter, but Leftie waved him to silence. John took the opportunity to continue. "Let's go for take two. What style do you want? Kirk or Picard?" Jeremy actually smiled just as John hoped, even the corners of two government types' lips twitched.</p>
    <p>"Why don't we try freestyle?" Leftie replied with a hint of a smile. John definitely liked the man.</p>
    <p>"All right. I am John Crichton on the leviathan Moya. I was formerly an IASA astronaut and presumed dead. I disappeared during the Farscape experiment in 1999 and ended up in another galaxy. Now I'm back."</p>
    <p>"Welcome home, Commander," Leftie intoned formally. "I am Ambassador Thomas Reginard of the United States State Department. On behalf of Earth I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Ka Dargo and the crew of the spaceship Moya. I'd like to present Ambassador Michel Soutain of the European Union, and of course you already know Jeremy Seymore of the IASA First Contact Commission."</p>
    <p>"It's a pleasure. Seeing Jeremy in a suit was definitely worth the trip." John grinned at his old friend's scowl. For the Jeremy he knew, non-ratty jeans and a t-shirt was considered "dressed up."</p>
    <p>Lefite, now Regie in John's head because it rhymed, smiled tolerantly as any ambassador would. "We are glad to have you home, Commander. If you don't mind my asking, what are your intentions now that you've returned?"</p>
    <p>You had to go straight for the toughie didn't you, thought John wryly. *He* didn't know what he wanted right now. The emotional tug of war wiggled it's way back to the forefront of his thoughts asking, What *did* he want? For a long time just "Earth" had been the answer, but now that he was here... Instinctively he looked at Aeryn. Hope, fear, and expectancy mingled freely over the beautiful curves of her face. Even silent, John thought her amazing. And if he could, he wanted his father to meet her.</p>
    <p>"I'd like to land if that -"</p>
    <p>"You want to what?!" Rygel yelled.</p>
    <p>"Sparky, shut up -"</p>
    <p>"No, he's absolutely right," D'argo jumped in. "You want to go down there now?"</p>
    <p>"I thought we agreed to wait." Aeryn's eyes, warm a moment before, now crystallized.</p>
    <p>He couldn't believe this. What the frell did they think he wanted to do? Sit on his ass and just wave hello? "Why are you all so surprised? -"</p>
    <p>"Excuse me, Commander," Regie spoke up.</p>
    <p>"Pilot, switch us off," barked D'argo.</p>
    <p>"Pilot, wait -"</p>
    <p>"Done." Pilot looked suspiciously smug to John. The rather frosty glares the other eight launched in his direction didn't dispel the conspiracy theory feeling.</p>
    <p>"What?" he demanded. "This is my planet, my home. You expect me to just stay up here?"</p>
    <p>"We agreed to wait," Aeryn repeated. "It's far too dangerous to be rushing down there."</p>
    <p>"We've gone to more dangerous planets before."</p>
    <p>"But never with every tracking instrument they have on us and an army waiting to greet us," put in Filalla. "Trust me, pre-alien species are not nice."</p>
    <p>"Thank you very much for your informed opinion," John snapped. "That didn't seem to stop you from trading with Earth before."</p>
    <p>"I was against it! You yourself proved the Humans will stop at nothing, not even murder, to make some scientific breakthrough!" declared Rygel.</p>
    <p>"That was completely different, John! We had no choice." Emmerit angrily moved away from the back wall. "We were out of food with a shipload of refugees."</p>
    <p>"They won't harm us!" John protested. "If we sign an agreement they won't harm us."</p>
    <p>"They put a bomb in the food crate!" Chiana shouted. "I'd say that's hurting us. Or trying to."</p>
    <p>"I'm not losing you again, John." This from Aeryn, stopping John's next argument in his throat.</p>
    <p>"This is really Earth, Aeryn. I want you to meet my family," he finally said.</p>
    <p>"Look, you said that they would honor an agreement?" said Jool, ever the advocate for civilized behavior. Without quitting his wife's gaze, John nodded. "Good. Then as long as we don't *rush* into things," she said pointedly, "and make sure everything's safe, you can go."</p>
    <p>"There's more than one way of getting hurt," said Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"I'm willing to take that risk."</p>
    <p>"Then I'm going with you." There was no arguing with that tone and John had long ago learned not to bother trying. So be it. It was definitely an incentive to make sure they would be as safe as possible. And his cunning woman knew it.</p>
    <p>"Fine." He turned to the others, ending on Pilot's image. "Can I talk to Regie now?"</p>
    <p>"No military, no cells, no doctors, no tests, no army -"</p>
    <p>"No visit home. Yes, Dad. And I'll have the car back by ten." D'argo glared at him without the usual I only-tolerate-you-because-you're-my-friend behind it. He was deadly serious. John wouldn't get as far as the maintenance bay if the Humans didn't meet the warrior's security measures. John looked away first.</p>
    <p>The issue settled, Pilot re-established the link with Canaveral, and the three ambassadors for Humanity reappeared.</p>
    <p>"Sorry about that," John apologized but offered no explanation.</p>
    <p>Regie gave him another diplomatic smile. "It's quite all right. Now, you would like to land?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah, if it can be arranged. Who's in charge down there, IASA?" It would make everything so much simpler.</p>
    <p>"Yes. IASA and the International First Contact Commission are in charge of all alien encounters."</p>
    <p>"Good." Now what would be the best way to go about this? "Good. Up here we're a little worried about our safety on Earth because of that bomb and some ... other things -"</p>
    <p>"Commander Crichton, that bomb was placed by an independent group and was not sanctioned by IASA or the United States government. We will do everything in our power to keep you and your alien companions safe. Security measures will be put into place."</p>
    <p>"Yeah, that's another thing." We're afraid of the government too, thank you very much. Regie meant well, he supposed. "I don't want the US government involved with the meeting any more than strictly necessary. I want the President to sign a reaffirmation of my civil and Human rights and extend at least the Human ones to my friends. I also want him to sign an agreement of no military intervention. This will go down under IASA control only."</p>
    <p>"You forgot the doctors and the locks," D'argo reminded him.</p>
    <p>"I'm getting there. There will be no medical tests on anyone, and at no time will we be put into a locked room or cell. I want all that on paper, too."</p>
    <p>"Commander Crichton, be reasonable."</p>
    <p>"John," Jeremy spoke for the second time. "We're not gonna hurt you. And IASA would never harm the aliens. You *know* that."</p>
    <p>But John didn't. Maybe once he had, but cycles of fighting for survival had striped that kind of trust away. Home planet or not, now he had none to spare. Jeremy couldn't possibly understand. John cringed inwardly, feeling more than ever the uncleanliness of his existence. Score one for the Uncharted Territories, he thought bitterly.</p>
    <p>"Just ask, okay?" he said wearily. "These are our lives here. I'm not negotiating."</p>
    <p>"And if we say no, you'll stay on your ship?" Regie asked. "You're the one who wants to land. You don't seem to be in a position to give non-negotiable terms."</p>
    <p>It didn't take long for John to come up with an answer to that. "I've been living in an interstellar ... society, I guess you could call it, for the past ten cycles. There's a war going on out there, and Earth is completely vulnerable. There's no guarantee they won't come out here. And trust me when I say none of the potential victors are very nice."</p>
    <p>Regie, Rightie, and Jeremy exchanged dubious glances.</p>
    <p>"Besides," John added feeling guilty, "I heard all about that question list and I'd be happy to fill in the blanks once I'm on the ground." A little extra incentive for the scientists at IASA.</p>
    <p>Regie finally nodded. "We will speak to the necessary people on your behalf Commander."</p>
    <p>"Thanks. And Jeremy, I want to talk to DK or my Dad if I can." If he wasn't going down, he wanted to see them. And if he was, it was better to be prepared for the face-to-face meeting. Coward, he chastised himself. You just want to hide in the distance between because maybe then it won't hurt so badly.</p>
    <p>"I'll see what I can do," his old friend said.</p>
    <p>With that, they signed off. John turned to face his friends. "Well?"</p>
    <p>"Don't expect me to go down to the planet with you. I won't - no matter how much you beg," said Rygel in typical Rygel fashion before leaving command.</p>
    <p>Chiana asked, "How long do you think it will take?" to which John shrugged.</p>
    <p>"They're politicians but I don't think they'll be too long. National Security is at stake after all."</p>
    <p>Unsatisfied and nervous, the others drifted out of command until only John and Aeryn were left. Aeryn broke the silence first, "I don't like it."</p>
    <p>"You always say that."</p>
    <p>"Most of the time I'm right."</p>
    <p>"I can't turn my back on them, Aeryn. My family's down there."</p>
    <p>"I know. But I still don't like it."</p>
    <p>*****************************</p>
    <p>Chapter 4: Drawing the Bow</p>
    <p>*****************************</p>
    <p>"I don't want to hear it!" DK shouted in Jeremy's face before turning and striding down the hall on jelly legs. "This is somebody's idea of a joke!" He felt sick, wanting to throw up or pass out to ease the pain that would not go away. He could hear the world crashing around his ears like an ocean wave. Nothing was right anymore. All of a sudden, something ... everything was falling.</p>
    <p>"DK, please -" Jeremy started but DK cut him off.</p>
    <p>"John is dead!" Gone, not alive, vaporized. "I don't know what kind of alien showed up on that screen but it wasn't John!" Yesterday had been his day off, and he'd spent the beautiful early October day fishing so he hadn't seen the second contact. He was glad he hadn't, not if there was some ...creature posing as his very dead friend. "John is dead!" he repeated because he knew it was true. He'd been there.</p>
    <p>"And you're the person to confirm it!" Jeremy grabbed his shoulder but DK shook him off. He didn't want contact. "You were his best friend since God knows when. You knew him better than anyone and he *wants* to talk to you. We tried to contact him three more times yesterday, but he said in no uncertain terms that unless it was you or his father, he ain't talking. And if you don't do it, I'm calling the colonel."</p>
    <p>DK spun around so fast he nearly knocked Jeremy over. "You say away from him!" he yelled. "He was devastated when John died and I won't let some alien toy with his emotions!"</p>
    <p>"Then you'll do it?"</p>
    <p>Would he? Could he? *Could* he do it? DK closed his eyes in the face of the question and took a deep breath. It had taken five long years for him to get over the guilt. After the investigation, he hadn't had the strength to go back to the Farscape project and it had languished under various others, shifted around till Yora had grabbed it and convinced DK it was just an accident. He didn't know if he could face a mockery of his best friend, but better him than Jack. Jack had...Jack wouldn't be able to bear it.</p>
    <p>"DK -"</p>
    <p>"Fine, damn you, I'll do it." He'd said it. He'd do it. Though he didn't know how.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"So Lewis, what's the probability that we can keep this low profile?" Landers asked. On his desk were the signed and stamped civil and Human rights agreements for the aliens and John Crichton along with the statement that IASA was indeed in charge and that no military unit of any kind would interfere with the landing in any way, shape, or form. Paranoid returned hero.</p>
    <p>"None, sir," his aide replied. "Even if we had the power to suspend IASA's open public relations policy, too many scientists, including independent research stations here and abroad, know and would easily spread the word on the Internet. There is no way we could cut off all their computers and cell phones, and if we could it would create a major scandal that would blow the whole thing out in the open anyway. Besides it's already too late for that. As soon as the ship entered orbit, half the world knew about it."</p>
    <p>"Welcome to the Information Age," Landers muttered. It had been a hopeful question. He still preferred ink and paper most of the time, though e-mail was just as essential and the nifty locator message thingy on his cell phone came in handy.</p>
    <p>Besides, it would probably be political suicide for the US to try and direct the meeting more than was her right as an international partner. Landers sighed and resigned himself to the media frenzy that was, according to Lewis, already outside his door.</p>
    <p>"You and Richard get me a statement. Something cozy and diplomatic but not too cheesy or the people won't buy it. The media's going to be giving this enough saccharine as it is."</p>
    <p>"I'll get right on it." Landers handed him the signed documents and watched as his aide left the office, already making notes on his Palm Pilot. Yes, he thought back over Lewis' assessment, welcome to the Information Age.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>DK was more nervous than he cared to admit. He glanced at the piece of paper in his hands one more time. The list of questions stared back at him, questions of their shared childhood. The edges of the paper were already crinkled and curled from his anxious fingers. He wanted to back out and run away, but like a nightmare, he couldn't. They would call the colonel and DK knew he'd never be able to look John's father in the eye again.</p>
    <p>Jeremy appeared around the corner and beckoned him to one of the back rooms of the control center where the support teams normally plugged into the mission. It was almost empty now and the monitor set up in the corner at least gave DK the illusion of privacy.</p>
    <p>As he settled into the waiting seat, Jeremy sent the transmission to the alien ship. "Moya, come in. This is Jeremy Seymore with DK Moore. Do you copy?" There was only static; they were communicating by radio waves and not a digital signal. Jeremy repeated the message, and this time one of the aliens answered.</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid we don't understand," Jeremy told it. That was another thing, since the appearance of 'John', the translator had disappeared. DK wished they were still dealing with her instead.</p>
    <p>A moment later, another voice echoed over the line. "DK?"</p>
    <p>He felt his heart stop. Knowing it was supposed to be John and hearing his voice for the first time since the Farscape I were two far different things. "Yeah." He clenched the piece of paper in his hands. It was John's voice, there was no mistaking it, and it was tearing him apart because John was dead. He'd been there.</p>
    <p>"DK? Give me two microts," he said. *John* said.</p>
    <p>By the clock on the wall, it was actually five minutes before the monitor flickered to life, though it felt like hours to DK. But finally he was there. *John* was there, on the screen. His head and shoulders anyway. He wore a black shirt and didn't look nervous, but then John rarely had no matter what his stomach was doing.</p>
    <p>"Hey." Dk's throat was so dry it was more a croak than a word.</p>
    <p>"Hey," John practically whispered. His face was older, a few more wrinkles and gray hairs than before. But the eyes that watched him were the same, filled with both hope and fear. DK understood for the first time the saying 'the eyes are the window to the soul'. And when the thumb came up to brush his bottom lip, DK knew.</p>
    <p>"John." He tried to smile and think of something to say. "You're supposed to be dead," was what finally came out.</p>
    <p>"Everyone keeps saying that."</p>
    <p>"Yeah." But what were they supposed to say? he thought angrily, not sure why he was angry. Great gag? Glad we mourned you for nothing? It wasn't something to joke about. But John wasn't smiling. They stared at each other, neither one knowing what to say. Finally John looked away.</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry. Sorry for everything." For dying. It hung in the silence between them. According to the investigation report, the solar flares combined with the slingshot maneuver and possible pilot error were what killed him. Except he wasn't dead. He was sitting on the screen before him. Whose fault did that make it? Yora blamed fate - it was a terrible accident and there was nothing they could have done from the ground.</p>
    <p>"What happened?" he asked. John looked up, something new in his eyes that DK couldn't read.</p>
    <p>"A spatial anomaly triggered by the flares transported me to another galaxy."</p>
    <p>"Do you know what it was?"</p>
    <p>"Does it matter?"</p>
    <p>DK blinked. Did it matter? No, he guessed it didn't. In chemistry it was called a state function: when only the end result and not the path it took mattered. John had ended up in another galaxy. That was what mattered. Another galaxy - DK was having a hard time wrapping his mind around that too. "Not really."</p>
    <p>There was another brief silence. John opened his mouth a few times, but nothing came out. Finally he asked, "Will you come when I land?"</p>
    <p>"Yes." The answer was free before he thought about it. "I've missed you."</p>
    <p>John let out a sound that could only be relief. "I've missed you too." And for some reason everything was okay. They could talk again - about the frustrating question list, about the colonel, about the verifying questions John answered tolerantly - because it was another state function that John was alive and finally home.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"And we're rolling in five...four...three...two..." David raised one finger then pointed it at her. Shannon relaxed for the camera and began her rehearsed speech.</p>
    <p>"On October 4th the alien spaceship Moya returned to Earth, six months after the initial contact in April. But this time, the aliens didn't come to trade. Instead they were bringing someone home - Commander John Robert Crichton Jr. of the IASA Astronaut Corps, the first Human ever lost in space. Crichton worked with childhood friend DK Moore developing the Farscape Project which still exists today. He was believed to be killed in the first experimental flight of the Farscape I, attempting the Slingshot Maneuver to prove the Theory of Gravitational Acceleration. The theory was later proved in 2005 by the unmanned Farscape II.</p>
    <p>"After extensive interviews this week, IASA officials say they are 90 % certain that it is indeed John Crichton on Moya and not an alien recreation. Commander Crichton has asked for and been granted permission to land at the Kennedy Space Center. While a date has not yet been set, officials are already planning for the event. Assured the threat from above is minimal, the main concern now is safety on the ground. In a statement earlier today, President Landers announced that he recognizes Commander Crichton as an American citizen and returned hero. His alien companions will be offered diplomatic status. The meeting will be held according to IASA protocol and military involvement will be limited to the National Guard securing the perimeter around the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
    <p>"After the bomb found in the food crates during the alien Trade last April, IASA is taking every precaution. The international organization has already received letters of protest from anti-alien groups, including the Independence Day League and the Southern Baptist Coalition. Spokesman Peter Fielly says that they are taking the letters seriously. More on this story as it unfolds."</p>

    <p>Chapter 5: Leap of Faith</p>
    <p>***************************</p>
    <p>"Long sleeves or short?" asked John holding a shirt in each hand.</p>
    <p>Aeryn looked up from the bed where she sat fastening her boots. She was already dressed in her usual black leather pants, dark green long sleeved shirt, and black vest with her hair neatly pulled back in a braid. Around her neck hung a silver star on a thin chain. A matching star rested on John's bare chest as he waited anxiously for an answer.</p>
    <p>"Short. And wear your vest." Aeryn moved to her other boot.</p>
    <p>"Are you sure?" John looked critically between each garment.</p>
    <p>Aeryn sighed and stood up. He was as fussy as a ... well, him. "Just put the shirt on," she ordered, snatching the long sleeved one out of his hand. She went over to the shelf to grab his vest. It was a little shabby around the edges but suitable enough for high ranked officials. Besides, it was sexy. "You really shouldn't be so worried," she said holding the vest out for his arms.</p>
    <p>"I know. I can't help it. It's like seeing you again after...after everything."</p>
    <p>Aeryn's hands smoothed across his shoulders once then fell away. She didn't have to ask, she knew: after *him* and everything that had happened afterwards.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn," John, sensing the memories he'd called up, turned to face her. "I didn't mean -"</p>
    <p>"I know," she cut him off. "I know what you meant." No need to cut open healed wounds this close to Earth. Neither of them needed that right now, and as far as she was concerned, it wasn't relevant anyway. That decided, Aeryn reached out and pulled the star out from under his collar, her hand lingering just below. His wedding necklace, the compromise they'd finally settled on. The gesture spoke louder than words to the man whose body and soul were in tune with hers. "Think you can do this without falling apart?" she asked.</p>
    <p>John tilted his head slightly and took a deep breath. "Yeah, I'll make it."</p>
    <p>"Whatever happens..." She took a half step forward and leaned in so their foreheads were touching.</p>
    <p>"Yeah."</p>
    <p>"Ready?" they said simultaneously after a moment. Smiling at each other, they moved apart and headed for the hangar.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Medri shook his head at the mess in the maintenance bay when he walked in. Granted, most of the time it wasn't the tidiest of places, but now it looked like an explosion had rocked the room. Open crates, small arms, and grenades mixed with the usual mechanical parts and tools scattered about. In the middle of it all were the rest of Moya's denizens. The four going down to the planet armed themselves with the small, flat explosives they'd robbed from the gun runner, tucking them into waistbands and inner pockets so they wouldn't be noticeable. The authorities on Earth might have promised not to hurt them, but no one, not even John, was willing to go down there without backup.</p>
    <p>At one end of the work bench, John and Filalla were talking about Human customs and at the other, Jool was helping Chiana adjust her coat over the hidden weapons. In the corner by the hangar doors D'argo, Aeryn, and Emmerit were having a private conversation too low for him to hear. Knowing them, they were probably discussing possible escape routes for the four landing. John and Aeryn were of course going, Filalla because he was the best diplomat after Rygel who had made it very clear what his feelings were on the matter, and Chiana who had insisted. She could never resist a new planet, Medri smiled. He headed toward her and Jool who were bickering as usual.</p>
    <p>"If you don't stop twisting, it will fall out again."</p>
    <p>"It wouldn't fall out if you had put two denches higher!"</p>
    <p>"Have you seen the clothes you're wearing?"</p>
    <p>"I am not the one who wears -"</p>
    <p>"You don't know dren about -"</p>
    <p>"I don't know about -?" The girls voices overlapped louder and louder until their words were lost in an indistinguishable shouting match that drew everyone's attention. After a microt, Filalla threw one of the grenades at them - with the safety still on of course. The shouting immediately shifted directions.</p>
    <p>"Oww!" Jool rubbed furiously at the spot where the grenade had hit her. "That's going to bruise, you trejamb!"</p>
    <p>"If you'd shut your frelling mouth, I wouldn't have thrown it! So shut up!"</p>
    <p>"Jool, calm down," Medri told her, taking a seat near Chiana.</p>
    <p>"But he -"</p>
    <p>"Jool, get over it already." John unstrapped Winona from his leg and carefully set her down. "It's not like you've never been hit worse before."</p>
    <p>"It's the principle," she grumbled, shooting an angry glare at Fil. Chiana laughed, enjoying Jool's discomfort.</p>
    <p>"Are you ready to go?" Aeryn came up behind them with D'argo and Emm. She too had taken off her pulse gun, but nonetheless looked as dangerous as ever in her head-to-foot black and serious expression. Her words, brought the three floorfleas out of the walls or wherever it was they'd disappeared to - lately they seemed to pop out of thin air. Rhia and Seth noisily asked to go down to the planet again, but John and Aeryn were having none of it.</p>
    <p>Essor immediately ran to Chiana, tugging on her coat to be picked up. They were an odd match, black and white with a little pink thrown in. And with him, they were a veritable paints shop.</p>
    <p>"What are you smiling at?" Chiana asked with Essor in her arms. The little boy rested his head on her shoulder.</p>
    <p>"Just thinking what a colorful family we are," Medri answered. Tilting her head she glanced at Essor and then back at Medri, an almost distant smile on her lips.</p>
    <p>"Pip?" John and Aeryn had finished reassuring their two and stood with Filalla by the open hangar door. "You ready?"</p>
    <p>"I'm gonna go now," she kissed Essor's forehead. "We'll be back for supper, all right?" Essor nodded and let her pass him to Medri. With a last smile for them, Chiana followed the others to the transport pod. Pilot closed the doors.</p>
    <p>Essor tugged on Medri's shirt until he had his attention, then looked at the hangar door with a frown. Medri hugged him closer. "She'll be back by supper. Just like she said." They heard the engines powering up and the outer doors open. Around them, the others left for command, but Essor pulled on his shirt again when Medri went to follow. Understanding, Medri gestured vaguely at the work bench. "You want to help me straighten all this up?" He got a nodded affirmative in response, but when he tried to put Essor down, the kid refused to detach. "So," he settled the boy on his hip. "You be the right arm, I'll be the left."</p>
    <p>************************</p>
    <p>Chapter 6: Homecoming</p>
    <p>************************</p>
    <p>Ryan watched the TV somewhat guiltily with the volume turned low even though the house was otherwise empty. Melanie had taken the boys to the park because it was a beautiful day, she said. But he'd understood and let her go without a word.</p>
    <p>So here he was watching history alone. On the screen, the news voiceover babbled on about the two mile security perimeter around the Kennedy Space Center and the protesters and pro-alieners with their painted faces and banners to accompanying shots. As the minutes ticked away, the focus changed to the gaggle of dignitaries headed by the IASA First Contact Commission lining the red carpet on the runway. Other IASA personal waited anxiously on the wings, well back so as not to overwhelm their guests.</p>
    <p>Ryan started when the camera suddenly panned onto Jack and Lisa waiting beside diplomats from all over the world. He had known they would be there, Melanie had been invited too, but seeing them on TV was still strange.</p>
    <p>Unsettled, he glance at the top right corner of the screen where a small radar screen had been looped in from the Control Center. Even as he watched it, a smaller dot detached itself from the larger one labeled "MOYA".</p>
    <p>The stir at Canaveral grew like a wave through the crowds on the perimeter. Signs reading "TAKE US WITH YOU" waved wildly opposed by others denouncing the devil incarnate. The dignitaries in contrast remained calm as the beige craft - the same type as before - landed at a T with the red carpet. After about a minute, stairs unfolded from its side and four figures descended. When the shot zoomed in, Ryan recognized one from Jack's photo album.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless he was still surprised. His brother-in-law was not what he expected from the pictures and family stories. John Crichton was dressed all in black leather with a serious expression on his face that showed no hint of the easy going nature he supposedly had. Ryan was suddenly glad Melanie had gone to the park.</p>
    <p>Turning his attention to the other three figures, Ryan was again surprised because there was another Human! A woman, wearing the same style black and neutral expression as John. Together they looked like two soldiers in uniform. The other two aliens were clearly alien, he saw with relief. Both were grayish white but that's where the similarities ended. One was the same three-legged creature from the first landing wearing a dark blue outfit with silver lining. The other, dressed in silver-gray a shade darker than her skin, was two-legged and walked with a strange tilted gait.</p>
    <p>There was no sound of the event, only the commentator's who's-who narration as the two groups met. IASA Director Phil Oursler offered his hand. John stared at it for a split second before taking it, a smile suddenly transforming his face. There was a brief exchange, then the camera pulled back showing Jack and Lisa smiling broadly, unable to keep their emotions in. "John Crichton's father and sister have been waiting for this moment since they received confirmation that their lost astronaut had come home," said the commentator. The two groups stared at each other until John crossed the last line to his family.</p>
    <p>Ryan looked away from the screen, embarrassed that such a private moment was bared open for the world to see. He thought they should've waited, but IASA and the press wanted all the melodrama they could squeeze from their returned hero. From what Lisa had told him, IASA was being very careful with the media, not exactly shutting them out but not letting them run the program either.</p>
    <p>When the welcoming committee began walking toward the buildings, the image shifted to the conference hall where the official welcome would take place. "Well, Jim, as you can see," said the reporter live from Canaveral, "the scientists and astronauts here are very excited to meet John Crichton and his alien companions. Many of them knew Crichton before his fateful Farscape I mission and are anxious to find out what happened to him. In addition, IASA has invited sixty representatives from nations around the world, the UN, and the EU." Flags from every country with the representatives who were not in the welcoming committee were visible over the reporter's head in the background. "The global community spirit is very much alive for our galactic visitors."</p>
    <p>The woman didn't have time to say more because at that moment, the galactic visitors came in with their escort. Triumphant music Ryan didn't recognize played in the otherwise silent hall. All eyes were glued to John and the aliens. As they walked down the center aisle, a murmur grew into clapping and all out cheering by the time they had mounted to the stage for all the world to see. Oursler stepped behind the podium, adjusting the mike while he waited for the applause to die down.</p>
    <p>"My friends," he began over the dying noise. "Six months ago the age old question of whether we were alone in the universe was answered by the arrival of the Leviathan Moya, a ship full of intergalactic voyagers who wanted to trade. We thought then that Humanity would never be the same. Today I am here to tell you that once more history is in the making. In 1999, the manned space program lost its first astronaut, John Crichton, in our first step in manned interstellar travel. John Crichton was indeed lost, but only to another galaxy. Today, I have the great pleasure to say, Commander Crichton, welcome home." He stepped back amid more wild applause and cheers to shake John's hand again. The returned astronaut offered him a small smile before Oursler turned back to the podium.</p>
    <p>"On their first visit, our alien guests were wary of us, a new planet unused to travelers from beyond our solar system. Today we have the great honor of receiving the Sebacean Erin Sun, the Trojallal Filalla la Iola la Salla, and the Nebari Chiana as our first ambassadors of the universe." He half turned to their guests. "On behalf of our planet, I welcome you to Earth." Thunderous applause again rocked the room as Oursler shook the aliens' hands as well. Ryan thought he saw a spark of amusement in their faces but from their otherwise bland expressions he wasn't quite sure. The Sebacean woman exchanged a glance with John who shrugged lightly in reply.</p>
    <p>As the noise died down, John stepped up to the podium. "Thank you, Director, for your hospitality. It's good to be back." His brief words were met with more cheerful noise.</p>
    <p>The ceremony finished, the camera zoomed out to show the whole room. On stage, John and his aliens were doing the meet-and-greet with the diplomats. The reporter came back on with the schedule for the rest of the afternoon before the station switched back to its panel guests to tear the incident apart. Ryan switched it off, put on his shoes and headed for the park. It was after all a beautiful day out.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Shifty. That's what Reginard thought of Crichton: he was shifty and paranoid and damned good at hiding it. If he hadn't talked with the guy every day of the past week he probably wouldn't have noticed the way Crichton's eyes - and those of his companions for that matter - checked out every person, door, window, and security camera while he chatted amicably with the IASA Director about the Super Bowl. The four constantly exchanged innocent looks Reginard was now sure held the weight of conversation. In the medical lab for the translator microbe test and DNA sample, he'd noticed Erin Sun waiting conveniently by the door for them to finish. Crichton kept glancing at her throughout, reminding Reginard of the chopped arms comment and the ensuing hour long interruption when he'd asked for the sample.</p>
    <p>Getting Crichton to agree on an agenda had been like pulling teeth. Every single point was interrupted by one or another of his shipmates (Reginard had gotten to know Jeremy Seymore in the time they had spent waiting in front of the blank screen) and came back riddled with conditions or flat refusals. Crichton hadn't budged much once he came back on the line, and Reginard wondered just who was in charge up there, if anyone. The DNA request had set off an all-out shouting match quickly cut off from Earth's view.</p>
    <p>"Simply incredible this," Deputy Director Dean Scott came up to him. There were still five minutes before Crichton gave his speech to the diplomats in a meeting closed to the media. "I've dreamed of meeting aliens, but this is simply incredible. I wonder what we look like to them?"</p>
    <p>"Probably like excited children." Reginard looked over at the group speaking to Secretary Clermont. The gray woman, Chiana he reminded himself, looked fascinated by the conversation, Fil-what's-it smiled politely, and Erin, her features softer than before, was still impossible to read. There was irony in that somewhere.</p>
    <p>"I certainly hope Earth's finest make a better impression than that," Scott laughed. "There's so much we can learn from them. Just think of the possibilities! I can't wait till we get a chance to pick Crichton's brain!"</p>
    <p>Reginard smiled politely. A week ago he would have said the same thing, but Crichton had vetoed a Q-n-A session beyond completing the Trade List with a 'maybe later.' "I think that'll have to wait for his next visit."</p>
    <p>"What next visit? The man's home." Scott stared at the black clad astronaut hungrily. "He must have had an incredible life out there. That's probably what he's going to talk to us about today, don't you think?"</p>
    <p>"Probably," he agreed. Reginard was saved from further conversation with the appointee by the general shuffle to seats. As a member of the First Contact Team he had one on stage. "Excuse me. I believe were about to start." He made his way up the steps and to his assigned chair next to Crichton whose eyes flickered in his direction before roaming back across the hall. "Commander," he nodded in greeting.</p>
    <p>"Hey, Regie." Crichton shifted his attention back to the State Department man with a polite nod. Reginard had long since given up trying to get him to stop calling him by that awful nickname. But he had to ask himself, how hard was it to remember 'Reginard'?</p>
    <p>"I'd like to thank you for agreeing to give this presentation," he said instead.</p>
    <p>"Maybe you should hear it first before you thank me."</p>
    <p>Oursler began his short introduction then, leaving no time for a reply. But as Crichton rose, his jet black clothes suddenly jumped out at Reginard. He had a feeling Scott was going to be disappointed.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>His son was alive. Jack had been repeating it like a mantra ever since DK had told him the news Monday night. He still hadn't believed it till he'd seen John on the runway, really alive and home at long last. It had been like that summer John had come home from college with his hair in a ponytail - different but exactly the same. Jack didn't kid himself, he knew there'd be some readjustment, but they could deal with that later. For now, Jack intended to make the most of the hour they had before the final meeting with the press since there was no telling where John would be whisked off to once the aliens returned to their ship.</p>
    <p>The door to the lounge waited closed at the end of the hallway, the final barrier between him and his son. Jack didn't hesitate but firmly opened the door. DK, Lisa, Mark, and their two boys followed him in.</p>
    <p>Two heads looked up: John standing and the Human-like woman sitting on the edge of the couch. Recognizing them, she stood. Brushing aside the question of why she was there, Jack turned his attention to his son. John looked good, he thought smiling. Older perhaps, and different in black, but his boy with Leslie's nose and his grandfather's eyes was there just a few feet away.</p>
    <p>"Dad." That one word said everything. The next instant, the Crichton clan descended on their lost sheep in a storm of laughter and happy exclamations.</p>
    <p>"I still can't believe it!" "You must tell us everything!" "We missed you so much!" "It's so amazing you made it home!" "My God, John, you've got muscles!" This last from Lisa who gave his arm an appreciative pat.</p>
    <p>"What? You saying I was puny before?"</p>
    <p>"She wouldn't be wrong." Jack turned in surprise to the alien woman who'd spoken - in English! She smiled at their shocked expressions. Would wonders never cease.</p>
    <p>John, also grinning at their surprise, gently cupped her elbow and drew her into the group. "Enough insulting me. Everyone, I'd like you to meet Aeryn Sun."</p>
    <p>"She speaks English!" DK exclaimed.</p>
    <p>"It's a microbe thing. I'll explain later," said John. He turned to Aeryn and waved a hand in their direction. "As you've probably guessed, the king of the obvious is DK. My dad, Jack, my little sister Lisa and her husband Mark, and - my God, you're huge!" John really noticed the boys for the first time.</p>
    <p>"Robert and Ben," Lisa finished the introductions proudly. At fourteen, Robert was trying, and failing, to look cool while Ben, ten, wiggled in place.</p>
    <p>"You were this big when I saw you last." John held his hands about two feet apart.</p>
    <p>"I was just a baby," said Ben helpfully.</p>
    <p>"I remember babysitting you guys a couple times," said John. "Do you remember?" he asked Robert.</p>
    <p>"Sort of," said Robert. "I only remember the airplane."</p>
    <p>"Yeah," John nodded. "So Melanie didn't come?" His eyes turned to Jack who found he couldn't support their weight, his last conversation with his youngest daughter ringing in his ears.</p>
    <p>"She couldn't get free but you'll see her soon I'm sure," he said. "She's married now with two boys."</p>
    <p>"Melanie's married?" By mutual agreement, they moved to the sitting area. Aeryn and Jack settled on either side of John on the couch, Lisa, Mark, and DK in chairs across from them. They boys ended up on the end between their parents and Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"Twice in fact," Lisa answered. "Her first marriage lasted about a year, year and a half, and didn't end well. Ryan's great though. They got married in 2005 just after the Farscape II launch in November. It was small but at the cutest little chapel -"</p>
    <p>"Wait," John interrupted, "Farscape II?"</p>
    <p>Jack smiled at his obvious surprise, easing into the conversation. "You didn't think your death would stop the Farscape Project did you? Your theory worked. It worked so well in fact that we couldn't recover the module."</p>
    <p>"We're trying to work out a fuel ratio for the Farscape III," DK added. "Do you still have the Farscape I?" Jack couldn't help but laugh at DK's barely contained excitement at the prospect. It had been a long time since he'd seen his honorary son so unconditionally happy.</p>
    <p>John glanced at Aeryn who, from the turn of her mouth, was amused as well. "More or less. You probably wouldn't recognize her."</p>
    <p>"Did you put in a hetch drive? We still haven't figured out how it works."</p>
    <p>"Oh, Lordy, here we go. They're gonna be talking nothing but shop now," Lisa rolled her eyes.</p>
    <p>DK took the jibe with a sheepish smile. "Okay, forget the hetch drive. I have so many questions, and I know you're gonna get to them later, but I have to ask just one. The curiosity is killing me."</p>
    <p>Laughing at DK's anguish with the rest of them, John nodded.</p>
    <p>"Who or what is the translator that was here before?"</p>
    <p>Silence met the question as John and Aeryn exchanged a glance that held none of their earlier laughter. Watching them, Jack almost felt the tie that bound them together and wondered again what John's life was like out there. Lisa, ever the social butterfly, quickly changed the subject.</p>
    <p>"So." She turned to the alien woman. "I love your necklace. I'd ask where you got it but I doubt it would do me any good. Does it mean anything special?" Aeryn just stared at her a moment, then suddenly smiled and looked back at John, saying something in her alien language. Like magic, the smile transformed her into a woman of incredible beauty.</p>
    <p>"What?" asked Lisa looking back and forth between the pair. For that's what the were Jack realized when he noticed the same star necklace around John's neck.</p>
    <p>"You're married," he breathed, surprised and happy all at once. Lisa gasped, DK and Mark didn't know who to look at, and the boys were doing fish imitations.</p>
    <p>John nodded. "Our six-year-old is your translator." His thumb came up and rubbed his lip like it always did when he was nervous. The familiar gesture for some reason just added to Jack's happiness.</p>
    <p>"I'm so happy for you!" He grabbed John in another hug that was returned just as fiercely. The others, set free from the spell, leapt forward with congratulations. While he gave Aeryn a peck on the cheek, Jack heard Ben whisper to his brother, "It's like one of those books. Our aunt is an alien." Jack couldn't have cared less.</p>
    <p>"I want to hear all about it!" Lisa declared when they resettled into their respective seats. "How you met, was it love at first sight, the wedding, everything!"</p>
    <p>"It was definitely not love at first sight," said Aeryn launching the story of their distrustful meeting in one of Moya's cells after being picked up from space and going on to describe their short wedding on the ship years later. The time quickly passed, and before Jack knew it there was a rap on the door. It opened hesitantly revealing Jeremy in the hallway.</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid I need to steal John and Aeryn away," he apologized.</p>
    <p>Nodding, Jack stood with the rest to say goodbye. "We'll be there when the shuttle takes off," he said giving John a last hug. "Aeryn, I'm very happy to have met you and I look forward to spoiling my grandkids."</p>
    <p>"Thanks for coming," said John.</p>
    <p>"We'll see you later," Jack replied. John nodded and followed Jeremy out with Aeryn by his side. They watched them go silently. Staring at their retreating backs, Jack smiled feeling warm all over. Married. His son was alive, married and happy. He couldn't ask for anything more.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>DK once again found himself on the runway waiting for John. This time however, he was waiting for his best friend to finish speaking with Oursler and take the shuttle back to Moya with his friends and his wife. DK still couldn't believe John was married!</p>
    <p>A noise behind him caught his attention and he turned and saw one of the news trucks pulling closer. The media had been everywhere for the past week, practically camped out in the press room. They'd asked him for interviews he'd mostly refused - it was crazy.</p>
    <p>Back on the red carpet, John shook hands with Oursler then the ambassadors from the major countries. In all there were only about twenty who made up the escort: IASA First Contact people, a few diplomats, and him and Jack. Lisa and Mark had decided to skip the formal goodbyes and the ever present press looking for an angle.</p>
    <p>The gray aliens started down the carpet followed soon after by John and Aeryn. They were going now but this time it wasn't forever. Still, DK felt a kind of loss that John had decided to go back to the ship, even though he knew his friend had two kids waiting on him. When the group stopped suddenly, DK thought he had changed his mind. But before he could even brush the thought away as wishful thinking, John turned and yelled, "Down!"</p>
    <p>All hell broke loose. Automatic fire rained from behind, screams, shrieks, people running every which-way. On the ground, DK searched desperately for Jack but couldn't find him in the chaos. The woman next to him screamed when a bullet sliced into her arm and blood splattered on his cheek. The next thing he knew, someone was yanking on his arm and pulling him to his feet towards the shuttle, the nearest shelter.</p>
    <p>DK ran. He ran as fast and as hard as he could for sanctuary, the whole escort running with him. One of the gray aliens was scrambling up the steps closely followed by the first of the Humans. There was no sign of John or Jack. Amid the noise of gunfire and panicked shouting, DK could only focus on running. When he reached the steps, a noise more horrible exploded behind him and knocked him into the steps with a wave of heat. The people behind him screamed at him to hurry.</p>
    <p>Seconds later he was safe inside. The cabin was crowded and noisy with panic. No one knew what was happening, everyone was talking at once. John burst through the door and slammed his hand against the bulkhead. "Get us the frell out of here!" he yelled before dropping to the floor. It was then that DK saw why he looked distorted. He carried Aeryn, bleeding and unconscious. DK glanced around looking for Jack again, but it was too crowded and dark to see anything clearly.</p>
    <p>There was more noise, more shouts, and by the door John was holding his own coat against Aeryn's wound. Dimly DK realized they were taking off.</p>

    Sam Winchester always felt that the common misconception that his brother just didn't get possessed was rather unfair. True, the really bad shit did seem to bypass him and head straight for Sam, which was something of a bitch. But Sam had slowly developed the theory that Dean's amulet protected him from Full-On Evil, but at the price of drawing all kinds of Fucked-Up Weirdness straight to him. There was just no other explanation for the things that happened to Dean.
    
    Of course, no one knew about those things, because they all got filed immediately under the heading of "Not To Be Discussed Ever Again Under Any Circumstances, I'm Not Even Fucking Kidding Here, Sammy, This Never Happened, Got That?".
    
    Still, Sam did have some truly awesome photographic evidence if he ever decided he really needed to blackmail his brother for some reason.
    
    <u><i>One</i></u>
    
    When Sam was shaken awake in the middle of the night to find a mime standing over him, he actually screamed.
    
    In retrospect, he should have seen it coming. He and Dean were in the midst of another escalating prank war, and he'd got Dean pretty good in that bar the day before. He'd been expecting Dean to come up with something fiendishly creative, and he'd made a point of checking his bed out very cautiously before going to sleep that night. He should have known that Dean was just waiting until Sam let his guard down.
    
    Still, a mime? Who could be expected to see <em>that</em> coming?
    
    Dean was dressed in a ridiculous black-and-white clown outfit, his face covered in white face-paint, dark crosses marked over his eyes. He was possibly the most surreal thing Sam had ever seen, and considering the nature of their family business, that was saying something.
    
    He was laughing silently at the expression on Sam's face, almost doubled over with the force of it.
    
    "<em>Jesus</em>, Dean," Sam said, trying to bring his heart rate back under control. "You complete <em>asshole</em>!"
    
    Dean was still laughing, his entire body shaking.
    
    The fact that he was doing so silently was weird, though. Sam somehow doubted it was out of consideration for the people in the motel room next door.
    
    "Your mind is seriously twisted, dude," Sam grumbled, lying back down. "<em>Twisted</em>. Fuck off and let me go back to sleep. You are so going down for this one."
    
    Dean had stopped laughing and was now shaking his head wildly.
    
    Sam rolled his eyes and turned onto his side. "I mean it, Dean. Payback can wait until the morning."
    
    Dean moved around so that he was in Sam's line of sight and shook his head again, his expression now mildly panicked. He placed one hand deliberately across his mouth, then the other on top of it, and shook his head again, eyeing Sam meaningfully.
    
    Sam stared. "Dude, what the fuck?"
    
    It was Dean's turn to roll his eyes. He repeated the same actions slowly, placing both hands over his mouth and shaking his head. Then he gestured at his clown outfit and spread his arms in a helpless gesture.
    
    "You have got to be kidding me," Sam said sceptically. "You had your joke, Dean, I screamed like a girl, I get it, okay? This part is totally weak by comparison."
    
    Dean shook his head again and mouthed as if trying to shout, then clapped both hands over his mouth again.
    
    "You're kidding," Sam said. "You are totally not trying to tell me you actually can't talk, Dean."
    
    His brother waved one hand in a <em>finally</em> gesture, and nodded emphatically.
    
    Sam waited a moment for Dean to start laughing, then took a deep breath when he didn't. "You're serious."
    
    Dean rolled his eyes again, but nodded.
    
    Sam slowly sat up again and leaned against the headboard. "Oooooooookay. What the hell happened?"
    
    Dean glared at him meaningfully, but launched into a rapid series of mimes.
    
    Sam stared, openmouthed, and interrupted after a couple of minutes. "Dude, I'm not getting any of this. Start again."
    
    His brother glared harder, but began again, pointing at Sam and then placing both hands at the side of his face, tilting his head slightly and closing his eyes.
    
    "I was asleep," Sam said, guessing aloud. "Or you waited until I was asleep to pull this stunt?"
    
    Dean nodded firmly and continued, miming something very complicated that Sam took as meaning "payback for that prank in the bar the other day, you little bitch". He wrinkled his face in a puzzled expression, then mimed a light bulb going on above his head, then pointed at Sam, at his outfit, and mimed screaming.
    
    "Nice," Sam observed drily.
    
    Dean grinned broadly, then sobered again. He placed one hand above his eyes and peered around the room as if searching for something, then gestured at the outfit again, then pointed at himself and gave a thumbs-up sign. He mimed pulling on clothes, mouthing words soundlessly all the while, then clapped his hands over his mouth again, before spreading his hands helplessly.
    
    "I don't believe this," Sam said, shaking his head in disbelief. "You're being possessed by a <em>mime outfit</em>?"
    
    Dean shrugged, looking vaguely embarrassed.
    
    Sam stared at him for a moment longer, and then cracked up.
    
    It turned out that Dean could mime "fuck you" very effectively.
    
    ***
    
    "Sounds like..." Sam frowned. "Cake?"
    
    Dean nodded, and gave the "keep going" gesture.
    
    Sam thought about it, then suddenly sat up. "Lake! Spirit Lake? We drove through there a couple of days ago, didn't we? So that's where you bought the outfit?"
    
    Dean gave a relieved-looking nod and sank down into a chair.
    
    "I can't believe we're trying to solve a case using <em>charades</em>, man," Sam said, starting to laugh. "This is so fucked up."
    
    The response was a rapid series of mimes amounting to "You're telling <em>me</em>?" But Dean's mouth was twitching too, underneath all the make-up.
    
    They had experimented and discovered that Dean was restricted to mimes and gestures. He couldn't write or talk. The most amusing part, from Sam's perspective, was that his brother <em>had</em> to mime a response to a direct question, whether he wanted to or not. Sam wasn't entirely sure whether to be slightly freaked out or hugely amused by his brother's newfound miming skills, but he was taking a fiendish pleasure in asking Dean awkward questions just to see the mimed response. Dean's rendition of "I'm going to the bathroom to take a piss, QUIT ASKING ME FUCKING QUESTIONS, SAMMY" had left Sam in hysterics.
    
    The costume couldn't be removed. The make-up refused to come off, even when they had tried using holy water. They had concluded, after much talking (on Sam's part) and gesturing (on Dean's part), that their only option was to return to where Dean had bought the costume and investigate why it might possibly be possessing him. Of course, that plan was dependent on Dean managing to communicate where that had been.
    
    At least they'd narrowed it down to the town, Sam thought with relief. Dean would be able to point out the shop when they got there. Another round of charades to try to figure out the name of the shop was a bit more than he was feeling able to cope with right then.
    
    "Okay," Sam said, "let's get moving. Gimme the keys."
    
    <em>Like hell</em>, Dean mimed.
    
    "Fine," Sam said, grinning. "You can be the one to explain to the police officer who stops us that you're not drunk or anything, you're just possessed. Through the medium of mime."
    
    Dean glared daggers at him, and threw him the keys.
    
    Sam hummed happily all the way to the car.
    
    ***
    
    "Feel any more talkative yet?"
    
    The cause had proven to be fairly easy to pinpoint, after all; a mime artist had killed himself in Spirit Lake several years previously, leaving a suicide note complaining about how hard his life was, and how underappreciated mime artists were. The costume Dean had purchased had belonged to him. It had been a simple matter at that point to find the grave, and they were already at the salt-and-burn part of the evening.
    
    Unfortunately, it did not appear to be having any effect.
    
    "Maybe it's the costume that needs to be destroyed," Sam mused aloud. "Though since we can't get it off you, that'd be a bit tricky."
    
    Dean mimed what he'd do to Sam if his brother tried to set his outfit alight while he was still wearing it.
    
    Sam grimaced, then frowned suddenly as an idea struck him. "Hey, Dean. Why don't you try miming salting and burning his bones?"
    
    Dean stared at him as though Sam had gone mad.
    
    Sam shrugged. "Well. It's got to be worth a try, right?"
    
    One eyebrow arched sardonically, but Dean sighed and shrugged and did so, miming opening the container of gasoline and pouring it over the bones, despite the fact that they were already burning merrily, then pretended to shake salt over them, flicked open an imaginary lighter, lit an imaginary twig, and threw it onto the blazing bones.
    
    "- No way in hell this is going to - <em>hey</em>!" Dean beamed. "What the <em>fuck</em>, dude."
    
    Sam started laughing.
    
    Dean stripped hastily out of the mime outfit and threw it onto the flames, then snagged a bottle of holy water from their supplies and tried washing his face. The make-up came off this time.
    
    They tacitly agreed that Sam had won that prank war. And called a truce. For at least a couple of hundred miles.
    
    
    <em><u>Two</u></em>
    
    
    Sam had wondered what the hell was going on when his brother didn't return after an hour. After three hours, Sam figured he must have been kidding about going for a swim and had actually slipped off to the nearest bar. Or possibly the bed of the nearest waitress.
    
    Four hours after Dean had left for a quick dip to cool off, Sam went out to find something to eat. The path led past the motel's swimming pool, and Sam slowed and then stopped at the realisation that someone actually was swimming.
    
    It was Dean, although he looked exhausted and entirely lacking in his usual grace in the water.
    
    "Dean?" Sam called, incredulous. "Have you been out here swimming all this time? It's been hours, dude, I thought you wanted to go grab something to eat?"
    
    "Sam!" Dean gasped, his voice filled with relief. He didn't pause in his swimming; he was currently doing the breast-stroke, talking every time he surfaced. "Sammy, am I glad to see you -" He ducked underwater for another stroke and resurfaced. "You gotta help me, man, I can't stop -" Another stroke. "Think the pool's possessed or something..." He reached the end of the pool and performed a neat underwater turn before resurfacing. "I have to do eight lengths per stroke, and breast-stroke..." Underwater, resurface. "Only one I can talk during. Dude, you gotta help me, I don't know -" Underwater, resurface. "- How much longer I can keep going like this."
    
    If Dean hadn't looked so utterly exhausted, Sam would have thought he was joking. As it was, he called back "I'm going to fetch the laptop," and sprinted for the motel room.
    
    He returned to the pool side with the laptop a few minutes later to find Dean performing the butterfly stroke. Sam knew damn well that Dean had never voluntarily used that stroke in his life; one swimming coach had tried to make him, but Dean had insisted it was like violently drowning yourself, and really there were better ways to go.
    
    That settled it. Dean really was possessed.
    
    Sam rolled his eyes. How the hell did Dean even get himself into these situations?
    
    By the time Dean had completed his lengths using the butterfly stroke, front crawl and back crawl and returned to the relatively communication-friendly breast-stroke, Sam had managed to zip through a lot of research.
    
    "Okay, so you remember when the motel owner said the pool wasn't safe?" Sam asked rhetorically, and waited for Dean to dip underwater and resurface before continuing. "Three people have died here in the past year. All good swimmers, but drowned in the pool." Another pause for Dean to resurface. "The first seems to be the one causing the problem - high school student who hoped to make the swim team, undiagnosed heart problem, pushed himself too hard while practising and died."
    
    "Dude," Dean gasped out, "just tell me you know how to stop it."
    
    "Oh, right," Sam said, and started thinking.
    
    Dean groaned and shifted back to his drowning-not-waving butterfly stroke.
    
    The problem was, the high school kid had been cremated, Sam noted. Which... well, which left the pool itself. Right?
    
    He ended up pouring their entire stock of holy water into the pool water and performing a hasty banishing ritual.
    
    He knew it worked when Dean suddenly went under like a stone in mid-butterfly, choking and spluttering.
    
    Sam hauled him out, and Dean lay on the ground next to the pool, gasping for air.
    
    "You really need to work on your butterfly, man," Sam said eventually. "That was pretty weak."
    
    As it turned out, Dean didn't even have enough energy left to give him the finger.
    
    
    <u><i>Three</i></u>
    
    Sam had always had a slight terror of the pop star Shakira, ever since he'd seen one of her videos for the first time.
    
    He suspected that non-Winchesters, on seeing one of her videos for the first time, would probably be slack-jawed that any human body could move like that. And then most men would move straight on to thinking "Whoa, hot." Sam, however, was a Winchester, and he reached a different conclusion:
    
    Shakira's breasts were clearly possessed.
    
    Possibly not just her breasts, although the evidence for that was the most clear-cut. He'd watched several of her videos obsessively and finally concluded that no, he was not paranoid, her stomach was possessed as well. Which implied that perhaps her entire body was, and it was just manifested most obviously in those two locations.
    
    Jess had hit him upside the head and told him to stop ogling.
    
    Sam had protested that injustice, but had found it difficult to offer any alternative explanation for his behaviour. He had a feeling Jess wouldn't buy "I think Shakira's breasts are possessed" as an excuse.
    
    Now, however, Sam was feeling completely and utterly vindicated, because whatever kind of thing it was possessing Shakira, the same type of thing had now taken over his brother's body.
    
    The breast-dancing thing didn't work quite as well on Dean, since he didn't really have what could be termed a... (Sam groped - no, searched - for a suitable term) bustline. The stomach thing, though... Jesus. Sam had had no idea his brother could <em>move</em> like that. Or perhaps "writhe" would be a more accurate term.
    
    When Dean had unexpectedly hit the dance floor, Sam had at first assumed that Dean was both very, very drunk and being more of an exhibitionist than usual. Plenty of women, and not a few men, had soon gravitated towards him.
    
    But then a few alarm bells had started ringing in Sam's head, because he was pretty sure that no matter how much his brother had had to drink, he would not be dancing to <em>Shakira</em> if he was in his right mind.
    
    And then Dean had started <em>writhing</em>, and Sam had realised he was possessed.
    
    He had come up with a few theories while studying Shakira's videos, back before Jess had finally put her foot down about the whole thing. It had to be some kind of creature that thrived on the attention and the sexual energy it drew from its audience. Possibly some weird kind of Colombian succubus. He'd come up with a cunning plan to bluff his way backstage during a concert and investigate in more detail, but it was around about that point that Jess had put her foot down. Very firmly.
    
    Since he'd been back on the road with Dean, he'd almost forgotten about the possessed pop star. Dean would sooner have died than let Shakira's music be played in his car, no matter how much Sam had suspected Dean would appreciate her brand of dancing.
    
    He'd thought Dean would appreciate watching it. He'd never dreamed he would end up watching Dean dancing that way himself.
    
    Dean leaned unnaturally far back and Sam stared, openmouthed, as his stomach muscles rippled.
    
    Sam took a moment to consider his strategy. Obviously, what he <em>ought</em> to do was figure out a way to free Dean from whatever kind of weird Shakira-related thing was possessing him.
    
    Obviously, what he was <em>going</em> to do was dig the video camera out of their bag at his feet and start recording.
    
    Well, there was always the chance that it could be a ghost instead, after all. And Sam had always believed in being thorough in his research.
    
    Potential blackmail material... Well, that was just a bonus.

    <p>John and Aeryn slept in turns that night, as much as either one of them could sleep. Having put a whispered plan together, they now only had to wait for the graveyard shift to set themselves free. It was a long cold wait.</p>

    <p>"Oh, no!" said D'argo when he saw her in the maintenance bay with Norianti. "No!" He came to a halt with the four humans a step behind.</p>
    <p>"D'argo - "</p>
    <p>"You are not coming with us!" his voice was close to, but not quite a shout.</p>
    <p>"What? What's going on?" asked O'Neill, who due to shooting the DRD, didn't have translator microbes. D'argo ignored him. So did Chiana.</p>
    <p>"D'argo, you need me to cover you," she insisted, her head cocking to the side. "The old woman gave me some stuff, I'm not in any pain."</p>
    <p>"You're on drugs and you expect me to let you handle my ship?" he demanded. He glared at both her and Norianti, angry that the old healer would even consider helping Chiana put herself in harms way.</p>
    <p>"She thinks fine," Norianti told him primly. "And she should go. You can take her or Stark, but I don't think he's a very good choice." She leaned in and whispered, "Unbalanced."</p>
    <p>And while D'argo agreed that Stark was the last person he needed to go with them, there was no way he was letting Chiana, barely a day recovered, come with them. She could barely stand as it was.</p>
    <p>"Do you mind explaining what's going on here?" O'Neill asked impatiently.</p>
    <p>"Chiana was just wishing us luck," D'argo told him tightly.</p>
    <p>"I'm going with you," the Nebari quickly corrected him in English.</p>
    <p>"With us?" O'Neill asked skeptically, no happier than D'argo was about it.</p>
    <p>"I thought you were blind," said Jackson.</p>
    <p>"I got better," Chiana replied. "Now we need to go."</p>
    <p>"Oh, no!" O'Neill echoed D'argo's earlier protest. "No way. Yesterday you were almost dead."</p>
    <p>"And you'll be dead if I don't go," Chiana countered. "I'm covering you from Lo'la."</p>
    <p>"Chiana - " D'argo warned.</p>
    <p>But she just glared at him. "You can't stop me."</p>
    <p>D'argo considered tongue-ing her, but that would make her hit the floor hard, and she didn't need more bruises on top of her current injuries.</p>
    <p>"D'argo, please," she asked. And so help him, D'argo couldn't say no because he knew she just couldn't sit this out. She was functional, she would stay in his ship, and she could cover them. With their luck, they would need her, as much as he hated to admit it.</p>
    <p>"You have plenty of painkillers?" he finally asked.</p>
    <p>"You can't be serious?" O'Neill protested as Chiana nodded with a grateful smile. "We are going into a combat situation. She is too badly hurt to come with us."</p>
    <p>"Look, you already said it was a stupid plan. The more weapons we have the better chance we have of getting out alive," D'argo snapped, mad now at having to defend putting Chiana in danger.</p>
    <p>"She should not be going in there, Captain," O'Neill glared at him angrily. The other three humans looked uncertain about letting Chiana go, but by mutual consent let their leader voice their concerns. "If she collapses from exhaustion, or gets hurt what good will she be then?"</p>
    <p>"And if she saves our lives?" D'argo countered. "The decision isn't up to you."</p>
    <p>"Doesn't look like it's up to you either," O'Neill snapped back. D'argo bristled at the obvious challenge to his authority but let it pass in favor of reminding himself why he had been voted captain in the first place: to keep Moya and her crew safe and together. And right now John and Aeryn were in danger. The humans, surprisingly, seemed competent enough, but just the idea of Chiana backing them up made him feel better.</p>
    <p>"The decision stands," he told O'Neill. "Let's go." With a last hostile look at the humans, D'argo went to help Chiana up into Lo'la.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************</p>
    <p>The sounds outside the door had quieted arns ago. Aeryn hoped she was correct in her estimate of the time, but figured she couldn't be that far off. She'd tried counting away the microts while John rested, getting lost several times, but nevertheless, keeping a rough handle on the time.</p>
    <p>John was sitting in front of her between her legs, her arms wrapped closely round him as much for her warmth as his. His head rested against her shoulder where he had finally fallen into a light sleep. "John," Aeryn leaned down and whispered into his ear.</p>
    <p>"Mmmrrr," he responded sleepily.</p>
    <p>"John, wake up," she repeated, stroking his hair. "It's time."</p>
    <p>"Mmmm, 'kay." He shifted against her and opened his eyes before sitting up. A shock of cold air hit Aeryn's chest where he had lain. "Frell, it's cold," John muttered at their loss of contact. As unobtrusively as possible, he rolled onto his hands and knees and pretended to throw up. Aeryn placed a hand on his forehead and looked worried for the benefit of any hidden surveillance. They weren't sure if they were being observed, but had decided to err on the side of caution.</p>
    <p>When John finished heaving, he rolled onto his back, clutching his stomach and moaning as if he was in pain. "Get ready," Aeryn whispered to him. John grabbed her hand and squeezed. It was now or never.</p>
    <p>"Hey!" Aeryn jumped up and dashed to the door. "Hey! We need help! He's sick!" She pounded on the door to get the guards' attention, fervently hoping that at this late hour they were half asleep and tired. "He's dying! We need help!" Aeryn shouted, banging harder on the door. She could hear confused rumblings faintly through the door, then a shouted order, but so far no movement to open it. "He's gonna die! He's vomiting blood! Help! Please!" she screamed as pitifully as possible, as if her mate were really on death's door. She heard more shouting, louder this time with a frantic edge to it.</p>
    <p>And then the jangle of someone on the other side unlocking the door.</p>
    <p>"Here they come," she hissed to John in warning.</p>
    <p>"Let's hope we were right," he muttered back. Aeryn silently agreed. From their earlier observations, they guessed there were three guards in their wing of the building, token security more for the benefit of the scientist than to prevent escapes since their cell was solid.</p>
    <p>Aeryn backed up to let the first armed guard in, meekly bowing her head as he passed her without a glance. He strode over to where John lay rolling on the floor, touching him lightly with his boot. John screamed. The guard jumped back, and the second one who stood by open door darted a nervous glance toward Aeryn. Still keeping up the appearance of a helpless female, the ex-soldier shifted closer. She didn't have long to wait.</p>
    <p>Holstering his weapon was John's guard's first mistake. Leaning over his prisoner to evaluate his condition was his second. The moment John reached up and twisted his neck with an audible crunch, Aeryn sprang at her own guard, sidestepping his gun and landing a Pantak jab to the center of his forehead. As he fell backward, she snatched his weapon out of his hand and shot the third guard who was waiting just outside the door. None of them had time to shout for help.</p>
    <p>Ducking back into their cell, Aeryn went to help John strip the guards, but they had only gotten a far as weapons and jackets when the alarm went off.</p>
    <p>"Frell," Aeryn swore. Watched after all. Donning the short jackets, she and John ran from the cell down the hallway, away from where their earlier examination had taken place. Unfortunately the hallways all looked the same. Aeryn, in front, decided that avoiding recapture was of the utmost importance so they ran away from the sound of pounding feet. Behind her, John tried the doors they passed in search of a hiding place, but so far they had no luck.</p>
    <p>And even less when three soldiers turned the corner. "Down," shouted Aeryn, dropping to a knee to avoid the enemy fire as she laid into them with her own stolen gun. It gave her and John the time they needed to kill them.</p>
    <p>"Okay, that way's out," said John as he helped Aeryn to her feet.</p>
    <p>"And more coming," Aeryn stared down the still empty corridor where the sounds of more soldiers were growing. Turning back to John, she found him staring at the ceiling.</p>
    <p>"Think the ventilation system will support our weight?" he asked, dropping his eyes back to her. Glancing up at the vent, Aeryn shrugged.</p>
    <p>"If we can get in there."</p>
    <p>"Come on," said John. He grabbed her hand and pulled her toward on of the locked doors. With two shots, they were in an office and barricading the door behind them with the triangular desk.</p>
    <p>"Over here," said Aeryn spotting the vent in the corner. John stood on the chair to reach the vent, and a few minutes later he had the cover off and was shimmying up. The sounds from the corridor suddenly escalated, the bodies found. As she got on the chair herself, Aeryn heard the order for a room by room search. Doors slammed as John helped her up. A microt later, the soldiers discovered their barricade.</p>
    <p>John and Aeryn used the cover of the barrage against the door to replace the vent and slither away.</p>
    <p>While their escape through the air ducts didn't help with figuring out how to get out of the building, it did keep them hidden from their pursuers. From what they could see through the vents they passed over, the soldiers hadn't yet figured out where they had disappeared to. Now they just needed a map.</p>
    <p>"So, right or left?" John asked at yet another junction. Aeryn thought back to the last two turns. They were trying to go in a zig-zag path in one direction in hope of finding an external wall somehow.</p>
    <p>"I think this one's a left," Aeryn replied. The words were barely out of her mouth when a large explosion knocked her into John and the wall. She could feel the shock wave reverberate through the metal around them. She looked at John who stared back at her with an unreadable expression. "Maybe we should go right," she suggested.</p>
    <p>"This better not be an ambush," John muttered as they turned right instead of left and headed toward the source of the explosion.</p>
    <p>"I bet it's D'argo," Aeryn said with a grin.</p>
    <p>A smile hovered around the corners of John's mouth. "Always has to make an entrance."</p>
    <p>********************************************************************</p>
    <p>When D'argo blew a hole in the side of the building, Jack put away his anger at the alien and focused on the mission at hand. Get in, find the humans, get out. Keep everyone alive. The only problem was that he was now second guessing his trust in these people. What kind of leader let an injured, defenseless girl go into a combat situation? And wasn't she blind yesterday?</p>
    <p>During the flight, Daniel had asked about it, but all he got was a vague answer about it being the price for seeing things. To Jack, that sounded like defeating the purpose of having eyes, but with aliens you never knew. She said it wouldn't happen on this trip, but Jack had a feeling she was just saying that to make them feel better.</p>
    <p>"Ready?" D'argo rose to join them at the doorway.</p>
    <p>"Good luck," Chiana paused him with a gloved hand on his arm. D'argo nodded and lifted her hand to his lips, but instead of kissing it, he spit onto her palm.</p>
    <p>"You too," he said. Then he did kiss her, briefly on the top of her head, before barking the command to open the door.</p>
    <p>"You guys ready?" Jack looked over his own team, trying to bury the uneasiness he felt in the mundane.</p>
    <p>"We are, O'Neill," Teal'c replied. A second later they were out the door.</p>
    <p>The alarm had gone up already, wailing throughout the area so loudly that they couldn't hear themselves think. It was just a matter of time before they were swarmed by security, whatever that turned out to be. The intel D'argo and Rygel had gathered indicated that there would only be sporadic guards in the facility that they would be able to take care of if they were spread out. So without wasting any time, Jack followed D'argo inside.</p>
    <p>The first ten minutes were like any other search and rescue inside a building. D'argo was with Jack on point, taking out the ever thickening guards as they made their way to the southwest corner where John and Aeryn were supposed to be. Daniel and Carter followed a step behind, checking doors to make sure they didn't have any unwanted surprises, and Teal'c covered their six as usual.</p>
    <p>Then everything went to hell in a hand-basket. Suddenly instead of the two guards they were expecting a whole squadron rounded the corner with guns blazing. Shouts and screams drowned out the noise of the alarm as they retreated to a T intersection to take cover. Unfortunately it was a dead end. D'argo was shouting what had to be curses has he fired his rifle at the vulnerable guards. Pinned down, they couldn't even retreat the way they had come.</p>
    <p>"Carter, Daniel, find us a way out of here!" Jack ordered, giving up on the zat and sticking with his trusty P-90. The place was crawling with soldiers who had also taken cover at the next intersection. This was officially not good.</p>
    <p>Through the noise, he could hear his scientists shooting out locks in an attempt to find another hallway, or anything they could use to their advantage. He just hoped they thought of something soon.</p>
    <p>"D'argo!"</p>
    <p>The sudden shout of an unfamiliar voice nearly gave Jack a heart attack. He looked up at the alien standing above him glancing around at the ceiling.</p>
    <p>"John?" he called.</p>
    <p>"Ghost of Christmas Past, buddy. We're right above you," the voice answered. They were in the ceiling, Jack realized. How did they get there? Exchanging a look with Teal'c, he turned back to the soldiers. He would ask later when they were safe.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn there?"</p>
    <p>Another alien language answered at length.</p>
    <p>"Alright. Chiana's in Lo'la at the end of this corridor." D'argo replied.</p>
    <p>"And tell your friend in green to get our clothes and guns," the first voice, John added.</p>
    <p>Jack looked at D'argo. "Well?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"They escaped on their own. They're going to cover us from above so we can get out of here and meet us back at Lo'la," D'argo informed him. "Jackson," he called down the hallway.</p>
    <p>"Yeah?" Daniel appeared out of one of the side rooms.</p>
    <p>"Take all the clothes and weapons you found," D'argo ordered. Jack nodded when Daniel gave him a questioning look.</p>
    <p>"So when do we go?" he asked, turning back to the soldiers around the corner. The sudden screams answered his question.</p>
    <p>"Now!" D'argo leapt into the hallway firing his rifle. Jack and Teal'c quickly joined him. Daniel and Carter followed with a bag of what had to be the clothes. "Run!" And they ran, picking up even more soldiers from other hallways as they did. Once they cleared the hole in the wall, D'argo was yelling at Chiana and his ship to open up and cover them, which she did. Ducking low, they raced for safety.</p>
    <p>"Where are they?" Chiana demanded as soon as they were on board.</p>
    <p>"They're coming," said D'argo taking over the controls. The soldiers retreated to the rim of the blast hole, but didn't back off further.</p>
    <p>"There!" cried Daniel, pointing. Jack followed his line of site to a pale figure in an air duct on the left side of the hole. The person held up three fingers to them and slowly counted down. When he reached his fist, D'argo fired the big guns again just to the right. As the wall once again exploded, two people dropped down from the duct, firing guns at the remaining soldiers as they ran for the ship. D'argo barked more commands to open the door, and they were aboard. SG-1 turned to meet them as D'argo lifted off and shot them into space.</p>
    <p>"Hi," said the man from where he lay gasping on the floor, wearing only a jacket tied around his waist. The woman lay next to him, also gasping for breath, wearing her jacket properly, but nothing else. Jack looked away in embarrassment and turned back to the man.</p>
    <p>Before he could say anything, Chiana pushed past him. "John, Aeryn!" she cried happily as they got to their feet.</p>
    <p>"Whoa, Pip, what happened to you?" asked the man, John, as the white girl gave him a careful hug.</p>
    <p>"Stuff, you know," she evaded the question. "These guys found me, got me to D'argo."</p>
    <p>The man eyed Jack and his teammates over Chiana's head. "Colonel Jack O'Neill," Jack took the opportunity to introduce himself. "Major Carter, Dr. Jackson, and Teal'c."</p>
    <p>"John Crichton," the man extended his hand. Jack shook it firmly. "You have our clothes?"</p>

  content: "In her letters, Flannery O'Connor once stated that all her stories were about the action of grace on characters unable or unwilling to support it.  She achieves this effect most often by selecting one character to represent grace and playing him or her against a morally and socially ambiguous protagonist.  In many of her stories, the character who symbolizes grace is him- or herself deeply flawed, sometimes even to the point of also being a personification of Evil (see as an example the character of Manley Pointer in \"Good Country People,\" who represents Satan himself but brings some much-needed humility and perspective in his swindling of Hulga).  Ultimately, O'Connor's portrayal of grace is not as clean-cut as that a person would find in the Bible, or even the dictionary.  Her concept of grace is based in the mundane and the grotesque as much as it is based in the divine; from her perspective, grace is more defined by the effect characters have on each other than it is by any divine mandate.  For her, grace is for everyone, it's simply a matter of being willing and able to accept it when it acts.  In particular, her treatment of grace in her story \"Everything that Rises Must Converge\" highlights the everyday forms grace can take, and how flawed and human they ultimately prove themselves to be.  Eudora Welty's stories also often contain characters who represent various virtues, including grace.  Though it predates \"Everything that Rises Must Converge\" by nearly twenty years, her story \"A Worn Path\" has many of the same character elements of an O'Connor story.  Indeed, there are many parallels between O'Connor's personification of grace in \"Everything that Rises\" and Welty's story \"A Worn Path.\"  The main contrast between the two, then, comes as a matter of form and of purpose: while grace in the form of Phoenix Jackson is the central character of \"A Worn Path\" and is generally a morally good character, grace takes the form of a less overtly moral secondary character in \"Everything that Rises\" so that the main character is the one recieving its revelation and buckling under the weight of it.  In addition, while Welty uses Phoenix as a means to highlight grace itself, O'Connor chooses to focus on the effects of grace when it is bestowed on those characters who have none."

    Section 11: Who are you and where do you come from?<p>************************************************************************ ***********************************************************************</p>
    <p>Daniel was flustered as he retrieved the bag he had stuffed the clothes in. It didn't help that the woman, Aeryn Sun, glared at him the whole time, just daring him or anyone to look at her the wrong way. A little embarrassed himself to be still standing there staring at the two naked people they had just rescued - or been rescued by - Jack turned his back and said, "We'll just give you some privacy." He glanced over at Teal'c who looked back with a small smile Jack couldn't help but mirror. Sneak peaks at gorgeous women just couldn't be left unappreciated, no matter how wrong it was. And it was funny to see Danny all worked up. Carter just rolled her eyes at them.</p>
    <p>"So, Chiana, what's going on?" he heard John ask behind them. The girl apparently felt no need to turn her back, and surprisingly, Crichton and Sun didn't complain. She spent the next five minutes explaining to her friends in her own language.</p>
    <p>"Humans, huh?" said Crichton when she finished. "You can turn around now."</p>
    <p>The first though that jumped into Jack's head upon seeing them dressed was that they had to be hot in all that leather. The second was that he was dealing with two dangerous people. But that was probably a reaction to the all-black Matrix ensembles that screamed 'I know how to hurt you' to anything with eyes.</p>
    <p>"Uh, yes. We're humans from Earth," Daniel answered. "Though from what Rygel and D'argo have told us, not your Earth."</p>
    <p>"We think this is an alternate reality to ours," continued Carter. "I think the planet we landed on is an alternate version of the one in our reality. When we came through the wormhole we must have passed through either a radiation field in subspace or encountered - "</p>
    <p>"Carter, English," Jack pleaded. He was getting a headache.</p>
    <p>"Sir, this is a boiled down as I can make it."</p>
    <p>"It's alright, Joe - "</p>
    <p>"Jack."</p>
    <p>"Right," Crichton accepted the correction. He moved toward the wall and sat down between Aeryn and Chiana. SG-1 followed suit. "Back up a sec. How did you get on a planet if you came through a wormhole?"</p>
    <p>"We came through the stargate," Carter replied, as surprised as Jack was at the question. Both Crichton and Sun looked at Chiana who just shrugged nonchalantly.</p>
    <p>"I didn't understand this part," she told them.</p>
    <p>"The stargate is a device that creates a stable wormhole between planets. You enter in a gate address to another stargate and then you can just walk from one world to another. We explained it to D'argo and Rygel," Carter said patiently.</p>
    <p>"We didn't understand it either," D'argo called from the pilot's seat. For some reason that made Jack feel better. Looked like Carter had her work cut out for her here to convince these people about alternate realities and explain gate technology. Only problem was you needed her kind of PhD to understand most of it, and Jack for one didn't want to suffer through the lecture.</p>
    <p>"Just accept it okay?" he told them. They stared at him like he was crazy.</p>
    <p>"Accept that a wormhole can come into contact with a planet and the planet still be there afterwards?" demanded Sun skeptically.</p>
    <p>"Yeah," said Daniel, slightly confused, wondering like Jack, what she meant.</p>
    <p>"So you're saying that you have this thing that . . . controls wormholes?" asked Crichton.</p>
    <p>"Well, it's not like we carry it around in our pocket," said Jack.</p>
    <p>"But yes," Carter finished.</p>
    <p>"Blue, swirly thing. Takes you to other places too far to go by ship," Crichotn went on, still clearly not believing them.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Jack hissed. This was getting old. "Stargate. Big circle of stone that looks like a big puddle of water standing the wrong way up."</p>
    <p>"Must be that then," said Crichton totally confusing Jack now. The guy had a weird look in his eye that seemed to be looking through them.</p>
    <p>"What are you referring to?" asked Teal'c.</p>
    <p>"Your stargate," Crichton answered. "It keeps the wormhole from swallowing the planet. How big is it?"</p>
    <p>"About six meters in diameter," said Carter. He seemed surprised by that.</p>
    <p>"Wow, small."</p>
    <p>"How big are yours?" Jack demanded, insulted at the slight.</p>
    <p>"Much bigger," Crichton smiled. "But she's right about the alternate reality thing," he gestured toward Carter. "Except it wasn't a radiation field or a quantum scattering in subspace or solar flares that got you here."</p>
    <p>"Oh?" Jack raised his eyebrows, partly in surprise that he spoke Carter, partly because of the way he dismissed the second part of her theory. She was usually right about this sort of thing.</p>
    <p>"You just came out at the wrong place."</p>
    <p>Now that sounded entirely too simple to Jack. In fact it was something he could have come up with and saved the trouble of the whole discussion. Jack slapped his hand to his forehead in the classic light bulb switching on gesture. "That's it! We came out at the wrong place! Mystery solved, Carter."</p>
    <p>His second in command shot him a withering look before asking, "What do you mean, wrong place? We dialed a specific address that should have sent us to P5V-344. Any deviation would mean interference from an outside source."</p>
    <p>"So your stargate works like a phone?" Crichton asked. Carter nodded in reply and explained dialing planets again based on their coordinates in space. Crichton looked like he was actually listening now. "And you just walk through?" he asked when she finished.</p>
    <p>"Our bodies are molecularized and reconstituted at the other end of the wormhole," said Carter.</p>
    <p>"Pretty powerful phone you got there," said Crichton seriously. He looked pensive, and Jack did not take that as a good sign.</p>
    <p>"You still haven't explained this wrong place thing," he said suggestively.</p>
    <p>"Well I don't know much about your wormhole tamer, but wild wormholes out here connect billions of places and times." Looking at Jack he clarified. "Think of one like a big circular highway with lots of exits. Each exit leads to a different place in space-time. Exits that are close together are similar, varying in time and by different decisions that are made at specific points in time so you get your alternate realities - unrealized realities from the one we're in right now. It's hard to explain," Crichton shrugged and looked away. "Since you're not from my Earth, you're probably from one of those. It's kinda creepy actually."</p>
    <p>"Alright," said Carter. Jack could see her analyzing the new information and tying it into what she already understood about wormholes. "So our gate network is just one set of possibilities in a single wormhole network tied together by the same temporal indicator?"</p>
    <p>Crichton nodded. "That'd be my guess. The gates must let you navigate safely around unrealized realities and keep your time straight."</p>
    <p>"How do you navigate, John Crichton?" asked Teal'c.</p>
    <p>"Very carefully," he answered with a token smile. "It's hard to explain."</p>
    <p>"We're almost therer," D'argo called from the cockpit. The sudden turbulence or entering the atmosphere where Moya was parked, forestalled any further discussion. Soon, they were flying through the open door in the ship's hull and landing. D'argo talked to his ship to get it open and the six of them disembarked. Rygel, Nori, and Stark were there to greet them.</p>
    <p>"Sparky, my man!" Crichton shouted, snatching up Rygel and swinging him around amid the slug's profane protests. But Jack noticed that he didn't even try to escape in his flying chair. Meanwhile the old woman greeted both Chiana and Sun warmly, puttering about with her pouches for Chiana who was coming off her adrenaline and other painkillers. Stark hesitantly approached them, and Sun turned and spoke directly to him. He smiled and took the hand she offered.</p>
    <p>"They are a very close group," Teal'c observed as they followed D'argo over.</p>
    <p>"Ahh. The humans!" Nori smiled at them. "Did you have fun?" Her third eye blinked blue, and Jack couldn't help but smile at the crazy woman.</p>
    <p>"We ended up being the ones who needed rescuing, but yeah," he told her.</p>
    <p>"But you are still here and unhurt," Nori smiled, beckoning them closer.</p>
    <p>"Fun?" Daniel asked quietly so only his teammates could hear.</p>
    <p>"Well, you know," Jack gestured vaguely. Daniel only gave him a wry smile.</p>
    <p>"So what now?" Carter asked D'argo as Crichton put Rygel down. The tall alien was watching Chiana. He shrugged.</p>
    <p>"Chiana needs to rest," he said, moving to help her.</p>
    <p>"So do we," said Crichton. "Didn't sleep last night."</p>
    <p>"And then there was the escaping," Sun added.</p>
    <p>"So we'll hit the sack till dinner," Crichton finished, taking her hand.</p>
    <p>"Rygel can take you to your quarters," said D'argo over his shoulder as he left with Chiana once more in his arms.</p>
    <p>"What?" squawked the little slug. Jack smiled as they began to argue over who should do what while he, Carter, Daniel, and Teal'c followed them into the golden ship.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s a new one,&rdquo; said Tony as they left the family house of their dead Staff Sergeant. &ldquo;Sorry, sir, the computer did it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You think this is funny, DiNozzo?&rdquo; asked Gibbs as he strode back to the truck where McGee and Kate were finishing loading the evidence. Including the nefarious computer that the wife claimed was responsible.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;No, boss, I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not weird, it&rsquo;s a hacker that we are going to catch.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Or rather, Abby and McGee were going to catch. The two of them got to work as soon as they got back to headquarters. Two heads bent over two keyboards and one monitor, bouncing ideas and problems and weird things that came up out of nowhere. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; Abby wailed in frustration. &ldquo;This shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>By the time Gibbs came in with a Caf-Pow!, Abby was rhythmically beating her head, gently, against the desk, and McGee was using his finger to follow along a line of what looked like gibberish to Gibbs.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; he asked offering Abby the drink which she grabbed with half of her usual relish.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not looking good, boss,&rdquo; said McGee without looking up.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We found no evidence of hacking: no hidden files or Trojans, no weird access times,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;We peeled back every layer we could think of that might have been hiding his tracks. We couldn&rsquo;t find anything.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And things started changing with no reason,&rdquo; said McGee, finally glancing up, finger holding his place. &ldquo;File&rsquo;s we altered changed back.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We thought it might be auto recovery.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;But then it happened on changes to the program files and the operating system.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;So we looked closer because none of our interfaces were showing anything.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We even went into the assembly language, but the changes kept happening, with no record of them showing up anywhere.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re happening to at the machine code level. Which is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>It was all going over Gibbs&rsquo;s head, so he lifted his eyebrows meaningfully. &ldquo;In English?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Abby stared back, eyes wide and serious and no trace of humor, just defeat. &ldquo;I think the computer&rsquo;s haunted.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Gibbs stared back. Blinked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an answer, Abby.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not haunted, boss,&rdquo; said McGee like he had had this conversation a dozen times already. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on yet. It&rsquo;s making changes that only a user should be able to do without any evidence of a user doing it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo; asked Gibbs.</p>
    <p>Abby and McGee looked at each other, and it wasn&rsquo;t hopeful. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call you as soon as we have anything.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the next four hours of the night were spent with more nothing. Worse, the unauthorized changes kept happening, reverting files, deleting personal files and programs. Then new programs started to appear that hadn&rsquo;t been there before. The first time it happened, Abby jumped out of her chair and back away from the table. McGee could only stare, shocked.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;This is not normal,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s got a life of its own,&rdquo; said McGee with no little amount of awe.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;See! Haunted!&rdquo; said Abby pointing at the computer that otherwise sat on the table docilely. &ldquo;All right. You keep working on it, I&rsquo;m going to find out what the internet says about haunted computers.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The internet?&rdquo; said McGee skeptically. &ldquo;Abby, you know what people write on the internet?&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t believe she was taking the haunted thing that far. Though as another program &ndash; World of Warcraft, of all things &ndash; appeared, McGee was beginning to get more than a little creeped out by it, too.</p>
    <p>While midnight bled into ungodly morning, Abby made searches and read wikis and forum posts. By the time she picked up the phone and started making calls, McGee was asleep with his head on the desk. Abby&rsquo;s first attempt got her laughed at and hung up on, but the second did better. It started with a reply to comment on a &ldquo;Help! Erasures!&rdquo; forum thread, and led to a college student who had a friend of a friend, who had died, but his online account was still active, in use by another guy who was cagey and took an hour and generous paypal contribution to convince to give Abby the name of someone who might know someone who could help. The first someone was a women with a drawl who was even more suspicious and asked a thousand questions before finally asking for her address. Abby was still energized and awake enough to give the address of her favorite coffee shop and her phone number, figuring that whomever was coming to see her would appreciate the non-government building setting. So would Gibbs.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to meet who?&rdquo; demanded Gibbs three days later when Abby asked if she could borrow McGee for an hour.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;A guy who might be able to help us with the computer problem?&rdquo; she said.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And he can&rsquo;t come here?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s &ndash;&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to help us dehaunt it,&rdquo; said McGee, raising his chin a little. Abby beamed at him for a second before giving Gibbs a &lsquo;see?!&rsquo; look. It had taken her hours to convince McGee that they had to go talk to this guy. The fact that the computer was still acting like a crazy person &ndash; emo music had followed the programs into loading itself. Worse, when they played the songs, they were often scrambled and with sections or words missing, or sometimes sung in gibberish.</p>
    <p>Gibbs sighed and gave both of them a long look before rubbing his head and going back to whatever he was working on. &ldquo;Tony, tail them,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
    <p>Abby didn&rsquo;t go to her coffee shop for the coffee, she went for the ambiance. It was dim inside, with wall sconces and lamps instead of fluorescent lighting. It had brick walls and tables of different shapes, sizes, and heights to go with the non matching chairs, couches and beanbags in bright colors. A mural of the ocean and Poseidon with his horses covered the wall behind the couch. For midday, it was moderately occupied, a gaggle of college kids, a couple in the darkest corner, and a pair of guys watching the door. Abby led the way to them.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Sam?&rdquo; she asked them and the one with shaggy hair smiled and nodded. He looked like a college kid too.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Abby?&rdquo; At her nod, he added, &ldquo;this is Dean.&rdquo; Dean smiled too, his eyes flickering to McGee who was noticeably in a suit.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;This is Tim. We&rsquo;ve been trying to figure this computer out.&rdquo; Abby and Tim sat down, and after a few prompting questions by Sam, told the two of them about the computer. Dean obviously checked out of the conversation early, fidgeting and looking around the rest of the coffee shop. In jeans, boots, and flannel shirts, he didn&rsquo;t look like your usual urbanite. Sam, on the other hand looked quite at home. He was the one that paid attention, though didn&rsquo;t write anything down, his hands instead were wrapped around his mug looking red and chapped. He nodded seriously when Abby said, &ldquo;which is why we &ndash; I,&rdquo; she corrected when McGee coughed, &ldquo;think it&rsquo;s haunted.&rdquo; She waited uncertainly, nerves flitting back and forth, because while she did believe in the paranormal, Abby never really expected to encounter it herself. She was a scientist at heart, and there was a difference between believing in it and having to maybe deal with it.</p>
    <p>Sam said, &ldquo;It sounds like it.&rdquo; Then he smiled a little bit. &ldquo;Though I haven&rsquo;t heard of one haunting a computer before.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We ran into a haunted truck once,&rdquo; said Dean, almost out of nowhere. Both Abby and McGee looked over sharply at him when he rejoined the conversation. He had been listening. &ldquo;Who owned the computer?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;A Marine,&rdquo; said McGee. &ldquo;He died from blood loss when he stabbed himself with a knife while he was cooking dinner.&rdquo; Dean and Sam exchanged a glance and waited. McGee swallowed but went on. &ldquo;His wife wrote an email to her sister that she was worried about him stabbing himself since he was so careless with knives in the kitchen. She meant fingers of course, but . . .&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Who owned the computer before?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
    <p>Abby and McGee both shook their heads. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Sam, as if that were perfectly normal. He reached into his bag on the floor and rummaged around for a pen and notebook. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need the name of the Marine who died, his address, and the computer. We&rsquo;ll take it from there.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Uh,&rdquo; said McGee.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Abby with an anticipatory wince.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t what?&rdquo; said Dean, his gaze sharpening and all of his attention suddenly focused.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Have the computer.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s evidence,&rdquo; said McGee.</p>
    <p>Dean&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;Then how did you &ndash; oh no!&rdquo; He pushed out of his chair suddenly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Sammy, we&rsquo;re out of here.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Dean.&rdquo; Sam stayed seated and glared at his friend.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Dude, they&rsquo;re fucking cops,&rdquo; Dean hissed.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re asking for our help,&rdquo; Sam hissed back. Abby didn&rsquo;t know if she should break the staring contest that went on next. Beside her, McGee tried not to fidget. Finally, Dean broke it off and grabbed both his and Sam&rsquo;s mugs, taking them to the dishes counter. He stayed there, leaning back against the wall where he could see the whole room, a stormy expression on his face.</p>
    <p>Sam checked his position, over his shoulder, and Abby waved a hand to get his attention. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a cop,&rdquo; she told him.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Forensic specialist.&rdquo; Abby could feel Sam&rsquo;s eyes hit the highlights of hair, makeup, and tattoos, the corners crinkling a bit as he smiled ruefully.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he asked McGee.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a cop either,&rdquo; said McGee. &ldquo;Not technically. I&rsquo;m, uh, a Special Agent. Probational Field Agent.&rdquo; He squirmed under the level stared Sam fixed him with, the smile leaving his face and his eyes flickering back to his friend.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Feds?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;NCIS,&rdquo; said Abby quickly. &ldquo;And we really need your help.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s NCIS?&rdquo; asked Sam.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Naval Criminal Investigative Service,&rdquo; said McGee.</p>
    <p>Sam regarded them both for another moment, then said, &ldquo;Okay. First, we need to know who originally owned it. We&rsquo;re still going to need the computer but that can wait. It&rsquo;d be nice if we could verify that it&rsquo;s haunted, but it&rsquo;s a computer.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;How do you do that?&rdquo; asked McGee.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Normally with EMF,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Abby unable to contain her curiosity. &ldquo;Ghosts really emit that?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Sam nodded. &ldquo;But the computer will emit it&rsquo;s own that will screw up any signal. It&rsquo;s not connected to the internet, is it?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Abby responded, a little offended that he would think she would do something so amateurish.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Good. Are you sure there&rsquo;s no way I can see it without going to your forensics lab?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We could ask,&rdquo; said McGee tentatively, his tone making it clear that it was a long shot. &ldquo;What do you need from it? Is there anything we can do?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Sam sighed. &ldquo;You need to get some salt and put it in a solid ring around it, no gaps. It should keep the ghost contained so it won&rsquo;t hurt anyone else. You said it was adding programs that hadn&rsquo;t been there before? And you&rsquo;ve been the only ones to work on it?&rdquo; They both nodded, and Sam said, &ldquo;Then you two will probably be its next targets. You have to stay outside the salt.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Us?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It wants things the way they were. Ghosts can be particular about things like that,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;And it killed the last person who made changes to it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Put that way, there was a whole new dimension of creepy added to the case.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you when we have the information,&rdquo; said McGee after Sam explained exactly what they were looking for in their previous owner.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you,&rdquo; said Sam, pulling his phone out.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;But &ndash;&rdquo; McGee stopped and they watched Sam pry out his SIM card before repocketing the phone. He would bet that the phone would disappear into a dumpster minutes after they left. They weren&rsquo;t kidding about not trusting cops. Sam gave them a terse smile then went out the back with Dean.</p>
    <p>Abby and McGee &ndash; and Tony &ndash; took a detour to the grocery store before going back to the office. Tony mouthed off the whole way about how stupid and crazy pouring salt all around the computer would be.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing what?&rdquo; said Gibbs when they tromped through the bull pen still arguing.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Ring of salt to keep the ghost from killing me and McGee,&rdquo; said Abby who really wanted to get it done because who knew what could happen in the next ten minutes. There were guns in the room. She left McGee to fill in Gibbs on what Sam wanted and how paranoid Dean was.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Do they have last names?&rdquo; asked Kate at one point. To which the answer was no.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;They are helping us out,&rdquo; said McGee meaningfully.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;With a ghost,&rdquo; said Gibbs slowly as if speaking to a child. He still wasn&rsquo;t on board with the idea even though he had heard one of the spontaneously appearing songs.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yes, a ghost. That&rsquo;s living in a computer. I know it sounds crazy, boss, but there&rsquo;s not a rational explanation for the things it&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; McGee stammered.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;So your first explanation when things went strange was &lsquo;ghost&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;No. My first response was a, a program, that we weren&rsquo;t seeing, and then . . . Abby thought it was a ghost. After a few other theories . . .&rdquo; he trailed off. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t hurt to do what they say?&rdquo; he tried.</p>
    <p>Gibbs still had that flat, unamused, going-to-kick-ass-without-breaking-a-sweat glare going, but he finally waved McGee off. The real problem was there were too few other leads. Sadly even to him, the ghost explanation was looking better and better, if for no other reason than they were doing something about it. Load of crap that it was. The rest of the investigation was turning up bunk. There were no other hidden agendas popping up in unexpected places. No money, no drugs, no torrid love affair. Just a happy soldier who had quietly stabbed himself in the chest five times while his wife was in the next room.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Find out who these ghost hunters are and why they don&rsquo;t like cops,&rdquo; Gibbs told Tony and Kate. &ldquo;Then track them down.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;No problem, boss,&rdquo; said Tony. He waggled his phone with a huge, face splitting grin. &ldquo;I got pictures.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>McGee and Kate ended up tracking down the information Sam wanted while Abby and Tony worked on tracking down Sam and Dean. The pictures were really dark, and by the time they had the photos lightened, somewhat recognizable, and uploaded to the database, McGee and Kate had found out that Staff Sergeant Nygren had indeed purchased the computer second hand, and that the retailer had been donated the computer by a woman whose brother had died a year ago from tripping and banging his head on a coffee table in his living room, not five feet from the computer. He&rsquo;d been getting a snack during a pause in World of Warcraft. Gary Linburg had been a total computer geek.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Worse than you, McGee,&rdquo; said Kate when they were telling Gibbs.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s supposed to mean?&rdquo; McGee immediately had his back up.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Kate sweetly. &ldquo;You are after all redeemed by the fact that you use your powers for good.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>McGee frowned, not quite following. &ldquo;She means you use them for me,&rdquo; said Gibbs.</p>
    <p>The frown didn&rsquo;t go away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that would count as using them for good,&rdquo; he said. When Gibbs tilted his head just so, he added, suddenly remembering he was actually talking to Gibbs, &ldquo;I mean, you don&rsquo;t always have me follow procedure, or, stay exactly inside . . . legal . . . I mean, yes, absolutely good, boss.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Our computer geek?&rdquo; Gibbs prompted Kate.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty much it,&rdquo; Kate picked up the story. &ldquo;He was an online presence, had friends who were also into gaming. In real life, he worked for the Department of Agriculture in IT. No problems at work. His death was a clear cut accident, according to the police report.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our ghost?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s out ghost,&rdquo; said McGee. &ldquo;Now we just have to wait for Sam to call Abby.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Sam didn&rsquo;t call for another hour, and by that time the whole team was gathered around Thai take-out and the plasma screens with the mug shots of Sam and Dean Winchester displayed along with a rather impressive list of crimes they were wanted for by the FBI.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;They had to have been ghosts. Or things,&rdquo; said Abby as they stared at one grisly crime scene.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Why d&rsquo;you think that?&rdquo; said Tony. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably some scam that lets them get away with murder.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;My gut,&rdquo; said Abby, rounding on him. &ldquo;Why go to the trouble of listening to us? Why keep helping after they figured out this was a NCIS case?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Abby had a point that they all mulled over during the three seconds before the phone interrupted. They all jumped up, but Abby won the scramble for the phone, while McGee picked up the other line to get the trace started. Gibbs leaned over and hit the button for speaker, nodding to her to go on.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Abby, hey,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Hi, Sam!&rdquo; said Abby cheerfully. &ldquo;We think we have the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; The smile in Sam&rsquo;s voice was audible. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Gary Linburg,&rdquo; sad Abby. She spelled the name for him when he asked, and answered the few questions he had about where, when, and how he died.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;So, uh, we&rsquo;re still gonna need the computer,&rdquo; he said when she was finished. &ldquo;We have a way to take care of most of the ghost, but if he was that attached to his computer, he might have left part of himself there permanently.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Gibbs handed her a pad with what he wanted her to ask. &ldquo;I though the ghost was in the computer already. How are you going to get rid of most of it without the computer?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Uh . . . &ldquo; Sam paused. &ldquo;No offence, but you work for the government.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Grave desecration?&rdquo; Abby read off Gibbs&rsquo;s pad. The silence on the other end was long and heavy.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You looked us up,&rdquo; Sam finally said.</p>
    <p>Abby didn&rsquo;t feel that bad about it. &ldquo;As you said, we work for the government.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;So? Grave desecration?&rdquo; Abby repeated, this time like a little kid way to excited about digging up dead people.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You know where he&rsquo;s buried?&rdquo; Sam asked instead of answering. Abby looked at Gibbs for his approval, and when he nodded, took the file Kate handed over. &ldquo;Oak Hill Cemetery,&rdquo; she told him.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;There gonna be a SWAT team waiting for us?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Abby didn&rsquo;t even wait for a prompt.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t sound like he believed her. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m gonna have to call you back.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;But &ndash;&rdquo; He hung up on them. &ldquo;Gibbs!&rdquo; Abby turned on her boss. &ldquo;Why did you have me ask that? Now they&rsquo;re never going to trust us and we&rsquo;ll be stuck with a creepy, murdering computer.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;They were never going to trust us once they found out we were federal agents,&rdquo; Gibbs countered, gesturing to the screen where Sam stared back sullen and Dean was making kissy faces. &ldquo;Tony, take McGee and stake out the cemetery. Let&rsquo;s bring them in for questioning.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Tony and McGee shared an unhappy sigh, taking their dinners as they went. Kate followed Abby back to her lab where Abby grumbled as she pulled out the futon and crashed out.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve done some pretty horrific things,&rdquo; said Kate, trying to soothe her rumpled feathers.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I looked at one of those cases,&rdquo; Abby replied. &ldquo;And, all things considered, I don&rsquo;t think they did it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>That made Kate frown &ndash; all things considered was probably a hoax &ndash; and she said, &ldquo;Which case were you looking at?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Abby scrambled up and back to her computer. She pulled up the San Francisco murder and pointed out the first deaths with the same MO had happened before anyone saw any sign of Sam and Dean Winchester. &ldquo;And they all occur on the full moon,&rdquo; she pointed at the dates.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Dog maulings that occur once a month? I looked it up,&rdquo; said Abby.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Werewolves?&rdquo; Kate looked over at the computer sitting innocently in the center of a thick ring of salt. She looked back at the file. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m going to regret this,&rdquo; she said, going back into the bull pen. When she came back a few minutes later, she had the hard copy of the Winchester file and a new pad of paper. It was like a slumber party, camped out with Abby on the futon as they tried to remember every ghost story they&rsquo;d ever heard of and read between the lines of an FBI file.</p>
    <p>At sunrise, they shook Gibbs awake. &ldquo;Look at this.&rdquo; Kate shove her notes in his face, wild eyed and grinning, like she was about to eat him for breakfast if he didn&rsquo;t hurry up. Gibbs squinted, sleep still in his eyes and a crick in his neck. When he was taking too long trying to find a good distance to read it from Abby blurted, &ldquo;It means they didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; asked Gibbs, blinking hard.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Any of it! They were fighting ghosts and werewolves and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The Winchesters?&rdquo; It took a little while for Gibbs to go through their notes, and as he was finishing up, Tony and McGee rolled in looking much the worse for a night spent at a graveyard.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t show up,&rdquo; said Gibbs before either one of them could say anything.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tony. &ldquo;The rat bastards.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;But they did leave us something,&rdquo; said McGee holding up a plastic grocery bag. &ldquo;Lighter fluid, rock salt and step-by-step instructions for getting rid of the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Instructions,&rdquo; Kate snatched the sheaf of papers out of Tony&rsquo;s hand. They were stick figure cartoons &lsquo;so easy, even cops can do it&rsquo; the bubble above the shorter of the two figures said. Even his line-smile looked sarcastic.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Abby grinned, reading over Kate&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d they get past you?&rdquo; was Gibb&rsquo;s response making both McGee and Tony squirm.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big cemetery, boss,&rdquo; said McGee.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We think they hiked in and hopped the back fence,&rdquo; said Tony.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Look! That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; Abby exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bossing everyone around!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Think you can do it?&rdquo; Gibbs looked back at Tony and McGee.</p>
    <p>They eyed each other, puzzled. &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Get rid of the ghost,&rdquo; said Gibbs completely serious, even when Tony laughed thinking he was joking until he realized, that no, Gibbs wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; he swallowed hard. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The instructions are pretty clear,&rdquo; McGee added a little more confidently. &ldquo;They say to burn the computer, too.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;What are you still doing here then?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, boss, that it&rsquo;s the electronics and they&lsquo;re made of plastics and have mercury and heavy metals . . . burning is not really very environmentally . . . friendly. Or we could get the hazmat suits and do it in a closed . . .&rdquo; he looked at Abby for help.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really bad,&rdquo; she told Gibbs.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Get rid of the ghost,&rdquo; Gibbs told them. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>In the end they decided to first see if just salting and burning the bones would do the trick. Tony and McGee went back to the cemetery, dug up Gary Linburg, salted, burned, and complained a whole lot about the back breaking labor digging &ndash; &lsquo;Then fill in the hole back in before someone (you) falls in. It looks like less of a crime that way.&rsquo; said the cartoon &ndash; and filling holes was.</p>
    <p>Back in Abby&rsquo;s lab, she, Kate, and Gibbs watched the computer go crazy. It was amazing really &ndash; &ldquo;This would be so cool if it weren&rsquo;t really happening in front of us!&rdquo; said Abby &ndash; and if it hadn&rsquo;t been Abby&rsquo;s lab or evidence that his team had collected, Gibbs would never have believed it.</p>
    <p>Kate even said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe this,&rdquo; soft and a bit awed by the violently rocking desktop and the small whirlwind of papers and pens within the ring of salt.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t see it with my own eyes,&rdquo; Gibbs agreed, equally soft. When it stopped, it was a shock; the sudden silence after the final bang of the desktop on the counter was deafening. Tony called a second later.</p>
    <p>Kate drew the short straw for who had to turn the computer on. It booted up fine, and she followed Abby and McGee&rsquo;s shouted directions for finding the files that had appeared before. They were all gone. But when the computer jumped in one last death rattle, she screamed.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Salt! Salt!&rdquo; Abby tossed while Kate retreated, Gibbs and McGee helping steady her over the line.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;So now what?&rdquo; said Tony. Everyone looked at him expectedly. &ldquo;Oh no. No, no, no.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>But he went, armed with a screw driver, and followed Abby and McGee&rsquo;s shouted directions for turning off and dismantling the, quite literally, damned thing. The computer tried to electrocute him.</p>
    <p>That was when Gibbs shot it.</p>
    <p>After that it was practically a cake walk to dismantle. Abby and McGee took charge of the pieces, including the motherboard with a hole through the processor for later salting and burning. Gibbs sent everyone home for a much needed rest.</p>
    <p>The next day, after falsifying reports and officially putting the case on the back burner until it could get cold, Abby came over to Gibbs&rsquo;s desk and pressed a button on his phone. &ldquo;Hi, Sam,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You still there?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said Sam Winchester with the sound of wind in the background.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I can hear you much better now. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I was actually going to ask you that,&rdquo; said Sam with genuine concern. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re good. Thanks for the presents. It was so cool when I was in the cartoon.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Dean&rsquo;s idea. I think he likes you &ndash; ow.&rdquo; There were a garble of sounds then Sam was back. &ldquo;So did it work?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Exactly like you said. Even the imprinting on the computer after the bones were burned, but we had it covered. It was kind of exciting.&rdquo; Gibbs glanced at Abby, amused by her enthusiasm.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t recommend making a regular practice of it,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we couldn&rsquo;t do it ourselves. It&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t trust you, just . . .&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust <em>us</em>. It&rsquo;s okay. I read through your file and I wouldn&rsquo;t either. The FBI&rsquo;s doing a pretty crappy job with your case.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>That got a laugh and a resigned, &ldquo;Yeah. Hendrickson&rsquo;s a piece of work.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Hey, Sam? Thanks,&rdquo; said Abby seriously. Their asses would have been toast without the Winchesters.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Take care.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;We will. Bye.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>He hung up. Gibbs sat back in his chair and smiled a bit. Abby returned it with interest. Tony and Kate came around the corner, lunch in hand and McGee trailing.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Kate, you screamed like a little girl.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Tony, I am a girl. I can scream however the hell I want. You, on the other hand, screamed at least a register above your normal range. I though only boy sopranos could do that?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Or eunuchs,&rdquo; McGee piped in with his own grin at Tony&rsquo;s flapping jaw and hot protests.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Abby leaned in close over Gibbs&rsquo;s desk and said quietly, &ldquo;You think we can help them?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>It was an FBI case, so there wasn&rsquo;t much Gibbs could do. Through normal channels. If there was one thing Gibbs had learned from this case, was that normal had very little to do with anything.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>**************************************************
    Part 3: Battlefield Moya</p>
    <p>**************************************************
    Chapter 1: M*oya's A*erial S*ort of a H*ospital</p>
    <p>**************************************************</p>
    <p>"I need bandages!" John couldn't think farther than stopping the blood. His leather coat was all but useless for staunching Aeryn's shoulder wound. She was unconscious too, but a quick eye check promised no major head damage from the fall. But the blood loss worried him.</p>
    <p>The objective part of his brain told John that the transport pod was both noisy and crowded. He saw DK through several pairs of legs sitting stunned and out of breath on the floor. Louder shouts pulsed around him, one sounded like D'argo over the comm, but John barely noticed. Right now his head had space for only one thought.</p>
    <p>"Chiana!" he shouted. Aeryn's blood pooled around his knees; under his fingers her pulse grew weaker. The thud of the aid kit dropping beside him came none too soon with Chiana just behind. Quickly, the Nebari helped him replace his coat with a compress.</p>
    <p>"How bad?" she asked breathlessly.</p>
    <p>"Dunno. She's losing blood." John rummaged one handed through the aid kit for the syringe of blood clotters. Finding it, he emptied it into Aeryn's collarbone. Now there was nothing more to do except keep pressure on the wound until they got to Zhaan's apothecary. Nothing but frelling wait.</p>
    <p>"John, are you there?" D'argo's voice finally penetrated the haze of his mind.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn's hit," he lost no time telling the Luxan. "Looks bad so tell Jool to be ready when we land."</p>
    <p>"What the frell happened down there?"</p>
    <p>"We were attacked by a news van."</p>
    <p>"Some of the Humans were shot too," added Chiana.</p>
    <p>"Humans?"</p>
    <p>"We've got a podfull with us." John glanced around. Shock was settling in among the scientists and politicians. Arguments, tears, and in some cases blank silence mixed with the moans of pain from those wounded. No one knew who to turn to. Chiana, also looking around, patted his shoulder then rose with the aid kit to help those hurt. John turned back to Aeryn's pale face, silently praying to gods he didn't believe in for her to be okay.</p>
    <p>The trip to Moya was short; to John it didn't seem long before the docking web hauled them into the hangar where D'argo was waiting at the bottom of the steps. Together they rushed Aeryn to the apothecary where Jool shot questions at John as she hooked up monitors and a blood transfusion for the downed ex-Peacekeeper. He answered as best he could while he watched, helplessly holding onto a slack hand.</p>
    <p>It had happened so fast - but then it always took just one moment for things to spin wildly out of control. As soon as Chiana had uttered her warning, John had stopped thinking and simply reacted. Now, standing still while Jool worked, the adrenaline high that had gotten him through the last twenty minutes suddenly crashed, leaving John feeling empty. The bitter taste of betrayal settled on his tongue - having half-expected it only made it worse. And now Aeryn had paid the price for his misplaced trust.</p>
    <p>He closed his eyes. "Just tell me I didn't kill her again," he said.</p>
    <p>He could hear Jool and D'argo breathing and the noise of the approaching Humans in the corridor.</p>
    <p>A beat. "You didn't kill her," said Jool.</p>
    <p>The wave of relief was almost too much for John to bear, but nevertheless the weight of guilt eased somewhat. Reluctantly, he moved aside at Jool's prodding so she could get at the shoulder and let D'argo shove him onto a stool.</p>
    <p>"Here," the Luxan handed him a wet cloth before going back to help Jool. Accepting it, John noticed the blood on his hands for the first time. More blood. And they'd been so close to leaving in peace this time.</p>
    <p>John had just begun cleaning himself up when the noise from the corridor burst into the apothecary. The shell-shocked escort followed Fil and Medri in, clamoring for doctors and explanations. "Crichton! Crichton!" he recognized Oursler bearing down on him, followed by Regie and his father - Dad was here? Here and apparently not wounded, he saw with relief. "Crichton, what the hell is going on?! Why did you bring us here? I want explanations and I want them now, you hear me?!" shouted Oursler.</p>
    <p>"Director -" Regie laid a hand on Oursler's shoulder that was roughly shaken away.</p>
    <p>"No! This man was throwing grenades and I want a goddamned explanation!"</p>
    <p>"And what the frell was I supposed to do?!" John shook off his momentary surprise and jumped to his feet. "Let them kill us?!"</p>
    <p>"You *murdered* them!!"</p>
    <p>"I seem to remember them attacking us first! It was self defense and you'd be dead if we hadn't fought back!"</p>
    <p>"You -"</p>
    <p>"Everyone not bleeding get the frell out!" Jool interrupted. "OUT!" She stamped her foot and pointed at the door.</p>
    <p>"I'll not be ordered around -"</p>
    <p>"GET OUT!" D'argo's roar silenced the room. Oursler stared slack-jawed up at all of D'argo's seven feet for the first time. With a last wide-eyed look at John, the Director let Regie pull him away.</p>
    <p>"Son?" His father looked at him with compassion but also the same expression he'd worn each time John had tried to sneak in after curfew, his first car accident, and every other teenage transgression that had betrayed his father's trust.</p>
    <p>John turned away. He finished wiping the blood away angry at Oursler for being stupid, angry at his Dad for not understanding, and angry at himself that he ever thought he could go back to Earth.</p>
    <p>"John, please," his Dad tried again.</p>
    <p>"Not now," he said harshly, throwing the rag on the table. He wanted neither lecture nor comfort. A hand on his back made him start, but it was only Chiana with Winona. Grimly, he accepted his weapon and strapped her to his leg.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Of all the people they'd brought onto Moya, the Humans were, in Medri's opinion among the most curious. They were more subdued now that their comrades were being looked after, the panic replaced by acceptance for the moment. For a non-stellar society they were handling the situation well. A handful still had that wild look of terror of the unknown in their eyes but the others kept them close while they murmured to each other about Moya. Medri supposed discovery was a way of escaping the reality of their situation.</p>
    <p>"This way, you frelling coclemied welnitz!" Filalla's sudden loud shout brought the group up short, the Humans falling silent as suddenly as a comm cutting off. Craning his neck over heads, Medri saw the three legged man pulling one of the Humans back from a wrong turn. He could practically feel their guests holding their collective breath as they watched the scene, the calm a microt before melting into tension. The poor things couldn't understand a single word they spoke and it didn't help that, while Filalla was shorter than most of the Humans, he was still terrifying when he was as angry as he was now.</p>
    <p>"Follow. Me." Fil enunciated carefully, poking his chest on each word for emphasis. The Human smiled weakly and nodded, eyes wide and scared. "Idiot," Fil muttered then turned back down the main tier. Tentatively and with another growl from Filalla, the Humans followed. They passed through another tier before they resumed their quiet chatter in relief.</p>
    <p>"I thought he was going to shoot him or something," one of the men in front of Medri said quietly.</p>
    <p>"Me too. It's so nerve wracking not knowing what's going on," his companion replied. "At least at Canaveral we knew they wouldn't hurt us, but after what happened and what the director said...it's all different now. Like playing with fire."</p>
    <p>Medri snorted. In his experience, just about *everything* was like playing with fire. The two men turned in surprise and stopped suddenly when they saw him, apprehension on their faces. Giving them both a soft push to get them walking again Medri said, "I'm not going to eat you," which only made them flinch. Right, couldn't understand; they thought he was going to eat them anyway. "This is ridiculous. Pilot, can we get some DRD's with microbes down here?" The two men were glancing over their shoulders at him every few microts. Medri tried smiling to reassure them but it didn't seem to help. Instead it made him feel like a moron with defective children.</p>
    <p>Didn't they have interspecies cultures different of their own? Every planet did, or at least had factions of some sort. Of course, looking at his own planet where the Blues had been fighting the Yellows for millennia even after they'd gone out into space, Medri really couldn't fault them for being afraid. He himself had been a partisan, fighting against the Blue government in the streets of Moran for the better part of his life until the Nebari Takeover had changed everything. He'd rallied mobs, helped organize coups d'etats, and been a twisting knife in the foot of the authorities in general.</p>
    <p>Sometimes a leader would pop up calling for cooperation but Medri had never believed in it, hadn't even wanted to try until the Takeover. Who knew? The common Nebari threat had temporarily united his people, maybe it would last. An idle wish, he knew. Not after the new joint government had exiled almost everyone who'd put it in place, including him. Three cycles and Medri still wanted to pound the Senate into the concrete for it. He'd lost everything: power, respect, the only home he'd ever known, his meager family. He had been broken by the news of his exile, after everything he'd done, the difficulties of working with Blues and off-worlders, the loss; he didn't know what would have become of him if Chiana hadn't offered to take him with her to Moya.</p>
    <p>He'd thought it was another planet under the Nebari's heavy hand that he had no desire to help liberate. But Chiana had tilted her head in that way of hers when he'd asked. "She's a leviathan," she'd told him. "I guess she's home. The closest I'll ever find anyway," which had surprised Medri. Chiana had been a part of the Resistance when he'd met her and she'd clearly been around the galaxy a few times. He hadn't thought her the type to call anyplace home, much less a ship where order was the norm. When he'd asked if the captain would take him, she'd laughed. "All of them will take you, at least the ones that count." With nowhere else to go, he'd followed her on that slim recommendation. He'd been shocked at first by the flotsam and utter chaos - his own gang was better organized - but he didn't regret it.</p>
    <p>As they reached tier 21, one of the tiers outfitted for refugees, a commotion up by Filalla jolted Medri back to the present and the little party to a halt. "They're gonna kill us!" "Watch your feet!" "They sting!" The DRD's had arrived. Medri rolled his eyes then quickly grabbed a pair of Humans trying to run back the way they'd come. He managed to hold them still long enough for them to be injected before they broke away shouting. Medri let them go. They wouldn't get far if they ran since he'd locked the last door they'd come through. But they didn't run, merely pressed themselves against the bulkhead, staring at Medri with a mix of resignation and fear. He thought they looked silly. One of them was one of the two he'd scared earlier.</p>
    <p>"I told you I'm not going to eat you," he told them, a slight smile dancing across his mouth. The two stared then looked at each other, then back at Medri. "And you're not going to die; it was just microbes." They continued to stare stupidly.</p>
    <p>"Um... You're speaking..."</p>
    <p>"And you understand. That's generally what translator microbes do." Medri glanced towards the rest of the group. They'd calmed as well, no longer terrified. Many smiled in relief at their unbased fear, taking comfort like John often did in humor. Up at the very front however Fil was shouting with someone, their two voices carrying easily down the corridor. Filalla was winning.</p>
    <p>"I don't frelling care if it was not authorized by *you*!" His friend overrode the Human's argument forcing him to shut up. "We need to frelling communicate and thanks to *you*, Aeryn is bleeding to death and John has definitely had enough correllious dren for one day - I will not ask him to waste his time translating! So don't you dare accuse me of breaking any frelling agreement! That was done by *you* before we left the damn surface! So you will shut up and listen while I explain how the frelling door works!!!"</p>
    <p>The other blustered but Fil quickly and loudly cut him off. "Either you shut up or you won't see the outside of a cell until you leave! And I won't waste any food on you either."</p>
    <p>The negotiator, Reginard, pulled the other back. "I'm sure that won't be necessary," he said, placatingly. "Mr. Oursler was simply surprised. It has been a trying day."</p>
    <p>"Make whatever excuses you want. He yells again and I'll throw him out an airlock myself. He wants to talk to us, he talks through you. Is that understood?"</p>
    <p>"Absolutely," Reginard nodded. "Now, I believe you were going to explain the
    door."</p>
    <p>Following his lead, the Humans all looked at the cell door next to Fil and quietly listened while he showed them how it worked. Communication or dictation, Medri shrugged to himself as his friend began the same speech they gave the refugees. Filalla certainly had a way with people.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Rhia hurt. Her stomach clenched, her chest burned, and her eyes stung but she didn't want to cry. That was for babies. She was older and braver and besides, Seth wasn't crying anymore so she couldn't start now in front of everyone. No, she had to eat like normal. Except nothing was normal now.</p>
    <p>"I don't like these things," she declared, stabbing savagely at the fried vegetables with her fork. They tasted old and sour in her mouth after weekens of eating them, even fried. And they were on a *gray* plate which didn't help the taste.</p>
    <p>"Rhia, just eat." Dad sighed beside her. He looked at her tiredly until she shifted her death grip then turned toward his other side. "Seth, use your fork." He put said utensil into her brother's greasy hand. Rhia watched him and Dad, D'argo and Emmerit, Chiana and Essor. All of them ate as if it was normal. Her stomach knotted in protest.</p>
    <p>"I don't like them!" she repeated louder this time.</p>
    <p>"Rhia, eat. We'll trade for new food with Earth before we leave, all right?"</p>
    <p>"No! I won't eat it!" The burning pounded till she could hardly breathe.</p>
    <p>"Rhia," Dad set his fork down but she didn't wait for him to finish.</p>
    <p>"Never! I hate Earth! I hate Humans! An' I'll never eat their frelling food!" Needing to scream, strike, anything before she exploded, Rhia grabbed her plate and flung it as hard as she could at Dad, because somehow it was all his fault. Then she ran, sobbing in pain because nothing was right: Mama was wounded bad, the stupid Humans who were supposed to be good were bad, everyone was eating as if it was all right, and it was old food off a gray plate!</p>
    <p>Rhia couldn't see through the tears that burned down her cheeks, but it didn't matter. Her cries echoed strangely off Moya's ribs while she searched for a place to hide. Everything hurt inside and it would never get any better. Never! Because it was all *wrong*!</p>
    <p>She didn't know when or where she finally collapsed from exhaustion, just that her fists hurt wonderfully from pounding the floor in frustration. It wasn't fair! It wasn't fair! It wasn't fair, she sobbed. Dad's shirt had had blood on it, so had Chiana's. Mama was hurt and unconscious and might never wake up like Edinnal. The Humans were her Dad's people but they were nothing like him. They were stupid and mean and...and..., they were!</p>
    <p>"Shh," a hand on her back gently curved to pull her close. Rhia was too tired to resist and instead latched onto her Dad with what little strength she had left. It was easier to cry into his shoulder than Moya's floor. Wrapped in his arms she felt safe. The burning eased but the holes were still tearing her to shreds. "Shhh. It's all right," he crooned. "It'll be all right." He repeated it softly and just held her while she sobbed her heart onto his sleeve.</p>
    <p>Time stilled and her emotions lay like a weight over them while she cried, too thick to move. Why was everything so wrong again? Dad's soothing voice eased the rage Rhia didn't want to let go of. She *wanted* the pain and the misery, to fight against the peace he offered, but she found in the end she didn't have the strength, and her sobs softened into hiccups.</p>
    <p>"Why do the Humans hate us?" she demanded when she caught her breath enough to ask. "Is it 'cause we're different?"</p>
    <p>"Some of them," Dad answered. He brushed her hair out of her face with a gentle hand. "But not all the Humans hate us."</p>
    <p>"But they shot Mama!"</p>
    <p>"And they shot at the Humans with us. Humans aren't all the same, Rhia." He hugged her close rubbing her back. Rhia wiped her eyes with a corner of his sleeve. "It's like the Nebari or the Peacekeepers," Dad went on. "They've done some pretty terrible things. But does that make Mama or Chiana bad?"</p>
    <p>Rhia thought about it. She thought about the refugees she'd seen on Moya, battered and chased from their homes by the war. Emmerit had lost her home because of the Peacekeepers, Medri his because of the Nebari. But he loved Chiana anyway. And Mama would never hurt defenseless people, ever! And she'd been a Peacekeeper.</p>
    <p>"No," she finally answered. "But *why* would they would want to be mean like that?" Rhia didn't get it. They weren't at war; they were Dad's people!</p>
    <p>"I don't know, baby," Dad sighed. "They have their reasons, I'm sure. Fear maybe."</p>
    <p>Rhia cuddled closer, tired of everything. Dad didn't say anymore. It still wasn't fair, but the burning rage had drained away with her tears. They sat together in the corridor for some time, Dad's hand on her forehead soothing away the rest of everything.</p>
    <p>"John," his comm broke the silence.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, Jool." Rhia looked up at Dad who in turn looked down at her. It was about Mama.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn's waking up. You can come see her for a few minutes if you'd like."</p>
    <p>A smile split Dad's face. "We'll be right there," he said. Rhia suddenly felt light as air, tired but ready to fly because Mama had woken up. Maybe things would be okay after all. She scrambled to her feet and looked down at Dad who was still sitting. She offered him a hand up which he accepted saying, "What do you say we go find Seth?"</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>A throbbing pain welcomed Aeryn back to consciousness. It emanated from her left shoulder, behind her eyes, and just about everywhere else. All in all, it was bearable; she'd certainly had worse.</p>
    <p>From the hum, she was back on Moya which was a relief. She'd woken up injured in too many strange places, most not holding the best of intentions toward her, for her to be comfortable anywhere else. She still hated being wounded, always would, but at least she didn't have to think of escape plans at the same time. Thinking was not a good idea at the moment.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn?" It took her a microt to recognize Jool's voice but with the question came another level of awareness. Little noises of people moving, cloth rustling, various machinery, the drip of water. Her eyelids fluttered as she tried to open them. Once she succeeded, she closed them again - the light hurt. She tried again, and this time the gold-skinned Interion came into focus above her.</p>
    <p>Speaking was more difficult; her first attempt grated on her dry throat. Gratefully, she accepted the water Jool offered. "John?" she finally managed.</p>
    <p>"He's on his way. He wasn't hurt," Jool told her. Aeryn closed her eyes again, this time in relief. "Chiana and Filalla are fine too."</p>
    <p>"The vehicle?" Aeryn remembered it bearing down on them, and her pulling out an explosive, but she had been hit before she could throw it. Afterwards everything went black - the source of her headache she imagined.</p>
    <p>"I think John destroyed it. One of the Humans was yelling at him about it." Aeryn frowned, puzzled. "The ones with you on the landing pad are all on Moya. Five of them are wounded," Jool explained. "How does your shoulder feel?"</p>
    <p>"Hurts, but not bad." Jool made a sound that was probably disbelief, but she didn't have time to interrogate further because just then two sets of small footsteps pattered through the door.</p>
    <p>"Mama!" Aeryn turned and smiled when she saw her children running towards her, John following just behind. He'd shed his coat and vest and looked tired but nonetheless happy to see her awake. He and Jool helped the kids up onto stools on her uninjured side of the high examining table.</p>
    <p>"Are you okay?" asked Seth as soon as he was installed. "Dad says Jool says you'll be okay." He gingerly touched her hand, his forehead pinched with worry.</p>
    <p>Aeryn smiled. "I'm doing better now that you're here." She still hurt, but knowing her family was safe was enough to dull the pain.</p>
    <p>"Dad killed the bad Humans for you," put in Rhia. "And there's good Humans here now." Her eyes and nose were red from crying, and Aeryn wanted nothing more than to hold her close. Instead she settled for taking her hand and giving it a weak squeeze.</p>
    <p>"Are there? You'll have to tell me about them since I don't think Jool will let me go soon," she said. "But I'll be better in a few days."</p>
    <p>"Really?"</p>
    <p>"Really," Aeryn smiled. Rhia bent and hugged her arm. Seth too leaned in for a handhold, imitating his sister. John stepped forward and laid a hand on each of their backs murmuring, "Gently, gently."</p>
    <p>"I love you, Mama!"</p>
    <p>"I love you, too."</p>
    <p>"Come on," said John. "Mama needs her sleep. And so do you." He eased the pair back but they were reluctant to let her go.</p>
    <p>"I'll be here in the morning," she said. "Now go get ready for bed. No arguments." Surprisingly, they didn't offer any. When she looked at him, John gave her only a tiny smile as he ushered them away.</p>
    <p>"Go finish supper with Chiana, then pj's and dentics. I'll be by to tuck you in, okay?"</p>
    <p>"Night, Mama." The pair waved like two lost urchins, walking backward out of the apothecary.</p>
    <p>John watched them go, turning to Aeryn only when they were out of sight. "They were real worried about you," he said. He looked down and paused before going on. "Aeryn, I'm sorry for all this. If -"</p>
    <p>"John," she cut him off before he could start blaming himself out loud. "It's done. There were no guarantees." She waited till he looked at her then opened her hand which he gently took into his.</p>
    <p>"Are you in pain?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn considered it and shook her head. "I'll live."</p>
    <p>"Don't play the stoic soldier with me."</p>
    <p>"Really, I'm all right. I'm tired."</p>
    <p>"I'm staying right here." He squeezed her good hand; his was warm and comforting where hers was cold. Aeryn closed her eyes and let herself drift to sleep. They had time to talk later.</p>

    <p>Chapter 2: Carnival Mirrors</p>
    <p>******************************</p>
    <p>The conference room was in an uproar when President Landers walked in. Secretary of State Andrew Clermont and Secretary of Homeland Defense Brian Wheeler were each talking with their people, voices rising and papers shuffling anxiously back and forth. A few generals from the Pentagon were also there, as well as Locher from IASA, and most of Landers' own staff. Each group drowned out the others while they competed with ringing cell phones.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most disturbing part of the chaos before him was the sight of Lewis Sheinson in his shirtsleeves with his tie loosened around his neck. His aide hadn't looked this harried since the embassy attack in Pakistan had sent him running all over Capitol Hill. He was presently standing in a corner of the conference room talking on his cell phone while he worked his Palm Pilot which he had hooked up to the hardworking printer.</p>
    <p>"Mr. President." The two words brought the room to a halt as everyone turned to look at Landers. Then like a freeze frame released back into motion, there was a flurry of rearranging and last minute paper shuffling - Lewis scooped up his printouts and, with Richard's help, rapidly sorted them into folders, one of which landed in front of the president, blue as usual.</p>
    <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," Landers began after his people finally settled into their seats, "I have gotten some very mixed reports in the last half hour and some worried phone calls from our partners overseas." Across from him, Clermont nodded in agreement. "The press is calling for the heads of just about everyone involved with IASA and specifically the US Government. Now I want answers." He made eye contact with the serious faces listening to him. "What happened, how, and what we are facing now. Locher, let's start with you."</p>
    <p>To the left, the IASA liaison cleared his throat and stood up. "Mr. President, preliminary reports from Canaveral - eyewitness accounts and distance news footage - show a breach in press security. The perpetrators hijacked a news van, bluffed their way past the secondary perimeter around the runway and opened fire on our departing guests. The sentry that let them by said they showed authentic looking documents permitting them within two hundred meters of the aliens. He gave a description of the men to the police who are currently running them through local, federal, and international databases. They should have more evidence for the investigation once the remains of the van cool down." He paused, pulled out a folder and passed it to Landers. A quick look showed it was a copy of the report with the details. He'd read it later. Locher continued when he looked up.</p>
    <p>"The escort headed by Director Oursler and Thomas Reginard took refuge in the alien shuttle when the van opened fire. We believe there were wounded; we know that the alien woman, Erin Sun, was shot. John Crichton destroyed the van and its occupants with some sort of explosive he had on his person then boarded the shuttle, which then took off immediately at 6:14 PM. IASA has been trying to contact Moya since the attack, but they're not answering."</p>
    <p>"All the people on the runway are now on Moya?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir." Locher motioned to the report. "There is a complete list there. Among them, IASA Director Phil Oursler; the First Contact Team liaisons Thomas Reginard from the State Department, Jeremy Seymore from IASA, and Michel Soutien from the EU. Eight other IASA personnel, seven diplomats - two US, the rest foreign - and Jack Crichton, John Crichton's father."</p>
    <p>"The Canadian, French, Russian, German, and Japanese embassies have been calling us non-stop demanding action," added Clermont. "The other IASA member countries are also holding us responsible for the breach in security. Everyone wants their people back on Earth a.s.a.p., but I don't know what we can do until Crichton talks to us. Everyone I've spoken to is on edge, especially since Crichton blew up the van. Added to the intergalactic war he brought us that sounds as fanciful as 'Star Wars', people are wondering what his real intentions are and if he's even Human. The good faith that started this has cracked and is disintegrating as we speak. If we don't get results soon, we're *really* going to have a crisis on our hands."</p>
    <p>Silence met Clermont's words. Looking at him, Landers read the seriousness of the situation on his friend's face and wished everything could have just gone right for once. The world did not need this now. Disconnected as they incident might be from geopolitics, the ramifications would no less shake the balance and web of trust that held the nations of the world in peace. Who knew how the Middle East would react to another failing of the Great Capitalist Nation; the new arms treaty would probably fall apart as a result, a piece of paper they desperately needed.</p>
    <p>"Do we know where the shooters came from?" asked Landers.</p>
    <p>"We're still looking into it. We should know soon," said Wheeler. "If it is a terrorist group, they'll probably claim responsibility. But with all the unrest, they could just as easily have been unaffiliated Americans."</p>
    <p>"What about Crichton? How did he get past security armed?"</p>
    <p>"To be honest, we didn't thoroughly screen Crichton or the aliens," said Locher. "They were skittish enough as it was, and we were more concerned with threats from the protesters. After all their demands, no one thought they would betray the conditions by bringing weapons. In my opinion, they would have left without using them. It was just another precaution."</p>
    <p>"Opinions won't convince the press," muttered Richard. Landers could only agree.</p>
    <p>"I want to know as soon as Crichton responds. He is going to explain himself one way or another." Paranoid son-of-a-bitch had just lost him a lot of good will and Landers didn't plan of forgiving him. "What else do I need to know?"</p>
    <p>Reginard was proud of his little group and thanked God he was with IASA personnel and diplomats, people who were trained to deal with crises. The situation, however bizarre and unprecedented, had only cracked three people: Oursler, a junior diplomat from Canada on his second assignment, and one young woman with IASA. After the scene earlier, each one had been assigned a buddy to make sure they stayed separated and calm. Reginard didn't want any more outbursts complicating issues, especially from Oursler. The threat earlier hadn't looked like a bluff, and even if it was, he had no intention of calling it.</p>
    <p>Reginard and the fifty-year-old flight director, Tony Prow, had taken charge of the group now assembled in one of the four large rooms on their hallway. Filalla had informed them that they were locked in, so to take their minds off the imprisonment and restore a feeling a control, they had called a meeting to organize the household, so to speak. Looking down at the notes on his left arm - the scientists of course had pens but no paper - Reginard wondered how long they would have to stay here. One of the many questions on the list. God, he hoped they saw Crichton soon. He tried not to be prejudiced, but the aliens frankly unnerved him.</p>
    <p>Pulling his thoughts together, he turned back to the matter at hand. But before Reginard could announce the final list of room assignments, Filalla and the leopard spotted man walked in, each carrying a tray. The Human group watched in silence as the aliens brought what appeared to be food to the table next to Reginard - where he suddenly found himself under a pair of curious stares. Filalla's eyes squinted and he hunched forward slightly as if he was looking for a speck of dirt. Reginard had to force himself not to squirm under the close inspection. Finally, the alien straightened and looked up, an unreadable expression on his face. He exchanged a glance with his companion who just gave him a puzzled shrug, then said, "You know you could have just written on the floor."</p>
    <p>Startled in spite of himself, Reginard stepped back a little to re-establish his personal space. "We were not aware of your customs."</p>
    <p>"I don't write on the floor either but it's better than my skin," Filalla said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "We usually use chips. Don't you use real paper? John does when he can find it."</p>
    <p>"Yes." Reginard was a little embarrassed. "We unfortunately don't have any paper and we didn't want to sully the ship," he explained. "Is there any available, you could get for us?"</p>
    <p>"I'll ask," the alien shrugged slowly, his shoulders rolling oddly under his shirt. The strange gesture was disconcerting. "Supper," Filalla waved a hand at the trays. Reginard looked away from him toward the unrecognizable food. Sci-fi visions of raw, wriggly worms popped into his head but this looked safe enough, cooked at least. The hand-sized pieces were off-white, but he couldn't tell if it was animal or vegetable.</p>
    <p>"You eat it. And don't worry, we wouldn't waste food poisoning you." Reginard looked up startled by the new voice: the leopard spotted alien had spoken for the first time. He seemed amused. Looking around, Reginard realized that they had all been staring at the food as if they had never seen its like before. They hadn't in many ways, he thought defensively, glancing back at the food. Well, here it goes. He picked up a piece with his fingers since there were no forks and, before he could think about it, took a bite. It tasted fried with a slight orangey tang mixed with something else he couldn't describe. It was definitely *not* chicken.</p>
    <p>"It's good," he smiled politely and took another bite. It really wasn't that bad, if a bit unusual.</p>
    <p>Filalla snorted. "Taste's like dren if you ask me."</p>
    <p>"You're only sick of it because we've been eating it for a monen," his companion retorted.</p>
    <p>Reassured by Reginard's approval, the group of Humans came up in twos and threes for their own portions. "You're not going to eat us for variety's sake are you?" one of the IASA men suddenly asked. There was a pause; everyone turned to the aliens.</p>
    <p>"Anything's edible fried," said the leopard man seriously. A shot of panic stabbed through Reginard, but before it could settle, a wicked grin revealing yellow tinted teeth spread across the alien's face. And to his surprise, the IASA engineer's as well.</p>
    <p>"Edible if you're Rygel," Filalla grumbled, turning to leave.</p>
    <p>Seeing his chance to get answers leaving, Reginard hurriedly crossed the room to their departing hosts. "Wait! Please wait, sir." When Filalla turned back around he added, "I'd like just a minute of your time."</p>
    <p>"It's late. We'll talk in the morning," said Filalla. He started to move off again but Reginard hurried after him.</p>
    <p>"No. We need to make a few things clear," he pressed on. "Are we prisoners here?"</p>
    <p>"Technically?" the alien sighed, stopped, and turned. "No. Practically, we're locking you on the tier for the late watch because you outnumber us. But we do that with just about everybody whose not paying us for transport. Nothing against you except the attack. We'll see about the morning."</p>
    <p>"Who will make that decision? The captain?"</p>
    <p>"We'll put it to a vote," he shrugged and turned to go again, but Reginard laid a restraining hand on his arm that he quickly snatched back again. The skin was cold and clammy. Filalla looked at him with a fierce gaze.</p>
    <p>"Enough of this. I'm going to sleep," the leopard alien broke the staring contest by walking between them towards the door. Watching him go, Reginard glanced at his watch. It was only seven.</p>
    <p>"What do you mean a vote?" he turned back to Filalla. From the way the gray alien stared at him, he had just dropped a few notches on the list of intelligent life forms.</p>
    <p>"A vote: everyone chooses either yes or no."</p>
    <p>Letting it go, Reginard moved on. "I'd like to see our wounded."</p>
    <p>"In the morning. Jool says they'll live. That it?" Filalla leaned forward to scratch his middle knee. Watching him, a shiver ran down Reginard's back and he was reminded just exactly where he was.</p>
    <p>"Yes, for now. I'll see you in the morning?" he asked.</p>
    <p>All he got in answer was another rolling shrug. "Maybe." Filalla turned down the hallway then without a backward glance. The door was still open from the other's departure. Reginard watched him walk through it on his three legs, then as it closed and the light turned red. One of the little yellow robots was staring at him. Unnerved, Reginard returned to his blessedly normal Humans.</p>
    <p>Jack couldn't sleep. Old bones and tangled thoughts kept his eyes searching the curved ceiling for answers that remained in the unfamiliar shadows. Life was never simple, Jack knew that, but lost in its complexity he felt like he was floundering in deep water. In his mind's eye, he kept seeing John throw that damn grenade at the van, over and over again, without a flicker of emotion on his face. He saw John turn away from him in the medical bay and buckle the gun around his waist as if it naturally belonged there. He didn't want to think about it or consider what it meant, but his old brain wouldn't let the images go.</p>
    <p>His hopes of a happy reunion had been destroyed along with the news van, and he hadn't even realized it at first. John had had every reason to fight back, he'd told himself. *They* had opened fire first on a peaceful delegation; Aeryn was one of the wounded, it had been self-defense. But his arguments, reasonable at first, fell flat the more he thought about it, sounding like a bunch of excuses.</p>
    <p>Beneath was something Jack didn't want to touch but that nonetheless struggled to surface. *Why* had John been armed in the first place for a peaceful mission? How did he explain the cold face that didn't even bother to look back? The questions roiled in Jack's stomach as he slowly came to understand that he no longer knew his son. And it hurt, worse than when he thought him dead because the hole that had begun to heal with John's return was suddenly ripped anew, leaving raw, jagged edges.</p>
    <p>He'd believed another John had come home, one who would pop over for the afternoon to tell him about the latest on the Farscape Project and end up staying for diner and the game on TV. A John who hated guns and didn't wear black leather like some Hell's Angel. One who would never dream of actually killing another Human being as if it were part of the goddamned daily routine! It wasn't fair of God, Jack thought bitterly, to give him his son back just to have him be the kind of person Jack and Leslie raised him not to be. From the hour they had spent together, Jack had believed that everything would work itself out, but now he felt nothing but biting disappointment and a wellspring of grief. Jack feared the son he had lost was truly dead.</p>
    <p>He closed his eyes against the hailstorm of condemning images. Why, goddammit? Why had he been armed? Even if the change had saved his life, it was nothing like his John.</p>
    <p>Sighing in frustration, Jack rolled onto his side - and came face to face with a little girl not five feet away. She crouched by the wall with an adult's t-shirt pulled over her knees. Her black hair tumbled messily over her shoulders, and she watched him with clear blue eyes that made Jack's breath catch. Except for the hair color, she looked much as Melanie had as a child. There could be no mistake he was looking at his granddaughter, Rhia. She was beautiful.</p>
    <p>"Hello there," he said quietly.</p>
    <p>She didn't break eye contact, didn't move in fact, simply continued to watch him. Jack met her eyes and smiled to reassure her, enchanted. Her angelic face held a serious expression it wasn't quite comfortable with, but that was endearing nevertheless. Jack didn't know what she saw, but he didn't want her to be afraid.</p>
    <p>"You're my grandfather," she stated clearly after a few moments. "Jack."</p>
    <p>"And you must be Rhia," he replied. "It's an honor to finally meet you." She blinked once but didn't say anything. Jack wondered for a second if she had heard him but decided to let her take her time.</p>
    <p>"I have parents, but I've never had a grandfather before," she finally said. "Did you?"</p>
    <p>Surprised by the odd statement, Jack nodded, "I sure did."</p>
    <p>"Dad says he has two sisters and I have Human cousins. Do you know them?" Rhia went on.</p>
    <p>"Yes, I do." Jack smiled. He thought of his grandsons and wondered how they would react to the girl before him. "They're all boys. Robert and Ben are 14 and 10, and David and Peter are 4 and 1."</p>
    <p>"I'm six cycles old and I only know Seth and Essor, but they're little. Essor hasn't even started to talk yet," she imparted this news seriously. Jack smiled wider, amused by her sincerity and loving her for it.</p>
    <p>"You'll get to meet your cousins soon, I bet," he told her.</p>
    <p>"They'll come here?" she asked with wide-eyed surprise.</p>
    <p>"I don't know if they'll be able to, but you'll probably go down to Earth. You'd get to see your Dad's home too."</p>
    <p>Rhia shook her head, a small frown marking her forehead. "I don't like Earth, right now," she answered quietly but just as seriously as before. She looked away for the first time towards DK and Jeremy who were sharing the room. "But Dad says not all Humans hate us. Is that true?" Uncertainty showed through as her eyes bored into his for an answer.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, the conversation that had finally pulled his thoughts away from the attack brought it crashing back down on him as Jack realized what she was talking about and why she would hate Earth: her mother had been shot by Humans. The realization sent a wave of anger through Jack that his *granddaughter* whom he loved already, so innocent and vulnerable, had been touched by the violence. She should be playing with dolls and on a playground, for Christ's sake, not asking about how many people hated her. What kind of place did she live in where parents were special, grandparents unheard of, and violence the norm? His John would have protected her, he thought angrily, but the one he saw yesterday was a part of it.</p>
    <p>"Yes, it's true," Jack said strongly. "In fact, most Humans like you and would never hurt you."</p>
    <p>"How do you know?" Rhia asked, looking unconvinced.</p>
    <p>"I just do."</p>
    <p>Rhia digested this with another frown, then asked again, "But how?"</p>
    <p>"Because I've seen a lot of people who welcome you to Earth," Jack hoped that would be enough for her curiosity.</p>
    <p>"Did you really walk on Earth's moon?"</p>
    <p>The sudden change of subject evoked another smile out of Jack. It was just like Lisa, and Jack was happy to follow her to safer ground. "Yes, I did," he answered. Then Rhia surprised him by getting up, crawling under the covers, and making herself comfortable beside him.</p>
    <p>"Dad says its gravity is one sixth of Earth and it's like walking on Sorres without an atmosphere. Is that true?"</p>
    <p>"Walking on the moon was one of the best days of my life," Jack embraced the familiar subject.</p>
    <p>"Tell me." Rhia yawned. So Jack quietly told her about the selection and training, the flight, and finally the day he'd spent on the moon. By the time he finished, she was fast asleep with her head pillowed happily on his shoulder. Jack felt his heart go out to her again. His granddaughter. Holding her, his earlier turmoil eased. Somehow, he knew, he'd figure things out.</p>
    <p>A moment later it seemed, a soft noise woke Jack from a light doze; Rhia however didn't stir. Looking around for the cause, Jack found his son leaning against the wall just inside the open door.</p>
    <p>"Good morning," he said when he saw Jack was awake. He looked barely awake himself, hair mussed from sleep. He still wore black: an untucked t-shirt, the same leather pants, and unbuckled boots, but he was relaxed now, not a sign of his earlier anger and distrust. For the moment Jack saw the old John, and in this moment of peace, the one he wanted to hold onto. No matter what had changed, he was still his son.</p>
    <p>"Lose something?" Jack asked quietly. He sat up, careful not to wake Rhia.</p>
    <p>John smiled. "She does this every day. Our early bird alarm clock. Pilot keeps an eye on her." He nodded toward the red and yellow machine by the wall where Rhia had been sitting.</p>
    <p>"Everyday? Do you ever sleep?" Jack chuckled.</p>
    <p>"It's not just us, luckily. She pretty much rotates through everyone except Rygel and Filalla - they're apparently not very cuddly," John grinned and Jack smiled back. The gray alien taking care of them earlier didn't seem the cuddly type to him either.</p>
    <p>John pushed himself of the wall and came and sat down on the side of the bed. He brushed back a strand of hair that had fallen on his daughter's face. The contrast with his earlier coldness was startling. "I think she does it to make sure we're safe," John said after a moment.</p>
    <p>Safe because their universe wasn't safe, thought Jack. Again he saw John throwing the grenade and putting on the gun that, when he looked, was still there. There had to be a reason.</p>
    <p>John was watching him look at the gun. "I need you to be okay with this, Dad," he said. Hurt and hope vied for dominance across his face. The face of one who wasn't a killer.</p>
    <p>"What happened to you, son?"</p>
    <p>"What didn't?" John snorted and looked down at Rhia. "I've changed, Dad. Maybe not for the better, but I had to change to survive."</p>
    <p>"By killing?"</p>
    <p>"When I have to."</p>
    <p>"There are other ways," Jack bit out before he could stop himself. John's calm admittance without a trace of shame went against every principle he held. There was no way he could just let his son act as if it were all right. "You have a family, John! What do you think you're teaching your daughter by solving problems with a gun!?"</p>
    <p>"How to survive to the ripe old age of seven!" John hissed back angrily. "It's not a nice universe out there, Dad, and I have to *protect* my family. If it's a choice between us or them, I'm gonna make frelling sure it's them!"</p>
    <p>"And that justifies it!?" Jack snapped back, his voice rising. Beside him Rhia stirred as did DK and Jeremy, woken no doubt by the argument. John noticed, throwing a quick glance in their direction.</p>
    <p>"Look, I didn't come here to fight," John turned back to him. He offered a weak smile without any of his earlier warmth behind it. "Just for Rhia. It's time for her to get up. Tell Regie someone will be by in about half an arn to take you to the center chamber for breakfast."</p>
    <p>He stood then, gently shaking his little girl awake. Rhia blinked her eyes open. "Mama?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"She's doing fine. We'll visit her as soon as she's awake, okay?" John held out a hand for her to take then looked back at Jack. He was going to say something but in the end simply nodded.</p>
    <p>Jack watched them leave, wishing things were different.</p>
    <p>***************************************</p>
    <p>Chapter 3: Spinning Magic Eight Ball</p>
    <p>***************************************</p>
    <p>"Does 'Chiana' mean anything in your language? I only ask because our names often have ancient meanings from old languages. Mine for example, Peter, means rock, the symbol of solidarity that dates back about two thousand years to the founding of Christianity, one of our major religions, and you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?" The Human smiled self consciously and looked away. The woman of the bunch, Maria, chuckled and exchanged a knowing glance with Chiana.</p>
    <p>The two of them along with an older IASA man and John's father made up the small group Chiana was taking to the center chamber to eat. Since these Humans posed a minimal threat, they had decided to let them off their tier for breakfast in manageable groups as a show of trust. That and no one had wanted to haul food up to them again. After getting Essor fed, Chiana had jumped on the opportunity to change the routine.</p>
    <p>"I don't know if my name means anything," Chiana smiled at Peter. He looked up, his longish hair falling back into his face. He'd been asking questions the whole time they'd been walking, mostly about her, the Nebari and their customs, trying to get to know her as if they were chatting in a bar. He was very young by Chiana's standards and had an air of innocence about him that was endearing as he fumbled to make an impression. "What do you think it means?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"Me?" he asked, a thoughtful look crossing his face. "To me it will always mean 'Angel from the Stars'."</p>
    <p>Maria and the IASA man nearly choked trying to muffle their laughter. John's father, preoccupied by his thoughts, only smiled.</p>
    <p>Chiana paused, an amused twist to her lips: even she had to admit that was smooth. "You know, stars burn if you get too close," she blinked slowly and trailed a hand lightly down his arm.</p>
    <p>"I guess I'll just have to be careful then."</p>
    <p>"Peter, give it a rest already," Maria broke in. "I'm losing my appetite here."</p>
    <p>He looked at her with another sheepish smile. Tilting her head to get a better look at him, Chiana also smiled slowly. He was adorable.</p>
    <p>Turning down the next tier, they soon reached the center chamber where Emmerit was busy cooking, her way of getting out of escorting a group. "Sorry it's the same as your last meal, but it's all we have left," Emm apologized setting the plate of white vegetables on the table. From the shelf by the refrigeration unit, Chiana grabbed plates and cups.</p>
    <p>"Can we help?" asked Maria.</p>
    <p>"Nah, everything's ready," she told them, snagging the water jar and taking a seat.</p>
    <p>"Thank you again for allowing us to eat here," the older IASA man said as they followed her example. Chiana couldn't remember his name; she thought it started with a 'T' sound but she wasn't quite sure. She watched curiously while he patted the table around his plate, then, not finding a fork, shrugged and took two of the vegetables with his fingers.</p>
    <p>"You won't hurt us," Chiana belatedly replied. "It felt like the right thing to do."</p>
    <p>"After what happened..." Peter shifted uncomfortably and wouldn't meet her eyes. "We're really sorry about that."</p>
    <p>"Could have been worse," Chiana acknowledged. She actually would have been more surprised if nothing had happened at all. "What's John's phrase? Dren happens?"</p>
    <p>"Have you known him long?" John's father asked. Looking at him, Chiana noticed for the first time how much they resembled. They had the same set of the jaw, the same eyes.</p>
    <p>Realizing she was staring again, Chiana blinked and looked away. "Yeah, a long time. He's a good friend," she added, thinking back over the cycles.</p>
    <p>"How did you meet?" Jack asked.</p>
    <p>"I was being taken back to Nebari Prime to be mind cleansed. We took passage on Moya. To cut a long story to pieces, John set me free and convinced the others to let me stay."</p>
    <p>The Humans stopped eating in surprise. "You were a prisoner?" asked Peter quietly. He looked more shocked by this news than by everything else he'd seen.</p>
    <p>"Why? Do you like restraints?" she returned seductively, grinning when he blushed.</p>
    <p>"I didn't know you were a prisoner," Emmerit interrupted their flirting. "You were on Moya before you left the Resistance?"</p>
    <p>"I came aboard when Moya was pregnant," said Chiana, surprised Emm hadn't known.</p>
    <p>"The ship?" the T-man asked. "The *ship* was pregnant?!"</p>
    <p>Before Chiana could answer, John appeared in the doorway followed by Reginard. "Hey," he said. His eyes flickered over the room, locking on his father. "Sorry to interrupt your breakfast," he glanced at Chiana briefly before looking back at Jack, "but Rhia wanted me to ask if she and the boys could spend the day with you?"</p>
    <p>There was a silence, confusion once again passing over the other Humans' faces. The tension between father and son was palpable, making Chiana wonder how much John had told him while they were together on the planet. Obviously about Aeryn - he'd have to have been blind not to see it - and the children, maybe about his life the past few cycles. Whatever, his father was troubled by it.</p>
    <p>Finally a genuine smile eased over the old man's face. "I'd love for them to."</p>
    <p>John smiled as well, but his was in relief. "Thanks," he said before turning to Chiana. "Pip, that okay with you?"</p>
    <p>"It's fine -" She didn't have time to finish because just then the wall exploded. Rhia, Seth, and Essor burst from between two ribs in the shadows, the two boys tripping over each other and landing in a heap on the floor. Rhia nimbly jumped over them and ran to her grandfather.</p>
    <p>"See?" she called to Essor and Seth as they picked themselves up. "I told you he was real! I told them you were real," she turned to Jack. "That's my brother Seth, he's the white one, and Essor, he's the black one. He's Chi's. You'll really play with us today?"</p>
    <p>Chiana wanted to laugh at the wide eyed surprise on the others Humans' faces that quickly turned to amusement when the little girl started pulling Jack out of his seat talking as fast as an auctioneer.</p>
    <p>"Rhia, let him finish eating first," John admonished.</p>
    <p>"But Daad! It's already late and we only have now," Rhia whined, still tugging on Jack's arm.</p>
    <p>"He's not hungry," piped up Seth. He climbed onto a nearby stool and tipped Jack's plate. The vegetables slid to the floor in three successive plops. He showed the now empty plate to John. "See, Dad? Al' finished!"</p>
    <p>"Seth -"</p>
    <p>"John, it's all right," Jack interrupted laughing. He picked Seth up and settled him on his hip. "He's right, I'm not hungry."</p>
    <p>John rolled his eyes. "At least take a doggy bag." The tension between them gone, Jack did as ordered with help from Rhia who took extra "to feed the bats."</p>
    <p>"I'll be on the phone with Earth if you need me," John said. "They're all yours." Then with a final general wave, he and Reginard left turning toward command while Rhia pulled Jack in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p>Turning back to her charges, Chiana wanted to laugh. The Humans looked like they'd been hit by a transport pod. Maria opened her mouth, closed it, then finally said, "I'm confused."</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>John was relieved his dad had accepted; he'd been half afraid he'd say 'no' after their earlier fight. Seeing him smile and laugh gave John hope that they could work things out like they finally had after Mom's death. He didn't want to go back to the sterile discussions and half hearted pretension that they were there for each other. Now they had another wall to tear down, even more formidable than the first, but it looked like some of the ice was beginning to thaw.</p>
    <p>John smiled to himself, thinking about the pleased surprise on his dad's face when the floorfleas had appeared out of nowhere. Regie gave him a quizzical glance but didn't break the silence that had accompanied them since the center chamber. Probably thought he belonged in the loony bin, thought John. Hell after yesterday, everybody probably did.</p>
    <p>"You have beautiful children," Regie said suddenly. His voice was neutral, not a hint of what he thought beneath the words. "How old are they?"</p>
    <p>"Six and three," John answered, his good mood turning defensive. "And don't get any ideas about science experiments. The first person who touches them is dead."</p>
    <p>"Whoa," Reginard held up a hand. "No one said anything about science experiments. No harm will come to them if they go down to Earth."</p>
    <p>"Yeah, keep telling yourself that." Thinking about it now, John should have made them wait outside for Dad. Of course, knowing the kids, they would have popped up again somewhere else, their curiosity getting the better of them.</p>
    <p>"Commander Crichton," Regie broke the silence, "don't take this the wrong way, but may I ask why you insist on seeing the worst of us? We welcomed you with no strings attached. I know there was a bomb and the shooting, but those people represent only a small portion of our population."</p>
    <p>"Small but effective," John replied lightly, noting the irony of being given the same lecture he'd given Rhia.</p>
    <p>"A step up in security -"</p>
    <p>"Regie, there are always holes in security. Trust me on that." He sighed, running a hand over his face. "As to why I'm so paranoid, my kids are half Human, half Sebacean. Unique in the universe. I've met enough psychos who would kill just for the chance to study such - how did that one guy put it, 'rare specimens'." The normally cool diplomat paled around the edges. "You know as well as I do, the same type of people exist on Earth. A few alien recreations, a brief look into history, you bet Humans scare me. We're here."</p>
    <p>John led the way into command and up to the strategy table. On the clamshell, Pilot's image flickered on. "Crichton," he said in greeting.</p>
    <p>"Hey, Pilot, how's it going? Regie meet Pilot. Pilot, Regie."</p>
    <p>The diplomat nodded politely, his lingering eyes betraying his surprise. "It's a pleasure."</p>
    <p>"Moya and I welcome you aboard, Ambassador Reginard."</p>
    <p>Regie started at the use of his proper name. "Uh... Thank you."</p>
    <p>"Pilot, anytime you're ready," said John. Might as well get it over with. A few microts later the view screen changed from the view of Earth to a suit in Mission Control. The poor man jumped, obviously startled by the sudden change of status.</p>
    <p>"Commander Crichton? Mr. Reginard?"</p>
    <p>"Good morning. I'd like to talk to the head honcho," John said cheerfully. The young man nodded hurriedly and picked up a cell phone.</p>
    <p>"Hold on please," he said as he dialed a number off a scrap of paper. "Excuse me, sir. Commander Crichton has contacted us. Yes, sir, he's still here." He listened for a moment, then hung up with a shaky smile. "They're on their way. It'll be about five minutes."</p>
    <p>Pilot had told him that Earth had been trying to get in touch with them since the attack but with John angry and occupied first by Aeryn, then the kids, there hadn't been anyone to reply. Now after half a night's sleep, he was ready to talk and find out just what the hell had gone wrong. Regie's reassurances of Earth's good intentions didn't mean squat: they hadn't stopped the bullets that landed six people flat on their backs in the apothecary.</p>
    <p>"So who do you think they've let out of the bag to talk to us?" John asked Regie while they waited.</p>
    <p>The man shrugged. "Someone from IASA probably. All alien contact is under their jurisdiction."</p>
    <p>"Good ol' global spirit. It's a small world after all," the tune jumped into John's head. "It's a small world after all. It's a small, small world," he sang, earning him another loony bin look from Regie and a slightly fearful one from the kid on the screen not unlike those his shipmates had given him when he had first come aboard. It was the look that said, 'bizarre creature.' So be it, thought John. He continued humming.</p>
    <p>They didn't have much longer to wait. A hundred microts later, three more suits replaced the nervous watchman in front of the screen. Introductions revealed an IASA deputy director, an IASA first contact lady, and a government rep. The deputy director, Scott, began with the standard greetings and apologies from IASA for the breach in security, sugar coating the problem in an obviously practiced speech. "IASA feels *certain* that we can resolve our differences and reopen channels of communication," he concluded earnestly. John had the impression he wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.</p>
    <p>"Commander Crichton," Giller, the government rep, continued. Unlike Scott, his tone was abrupt and far from apologetic. "I'd like Mr. Reginard's report first before we begin talks." Without waiting for permission, Giller asked about the Humans and the wounded to which Regie told him all was well. They were fed and watered, and the wounded were being cared for in the medical bay. He gave their names and reported that the doctor expected them all to recover with minimal long term effects. He failed to mention the ravid scientists and the five star lodgings, but it was accurate enough.</p>
    <p>"So, Commander Crichton," Giller turned his cool gaze back to John. "It seems we have a situation on our hands."</p>
    <p>"You could say that," John replied.</p>
    <p>"Would you care to explain *why* you thought it necessary to kidnap twenty diplomats and IASA personnel? And *why* you refused to answer our hails?" The acid practically dripped from his words, sizzling the connection between them.</p>
    <p>"You want to tell me what the frell happened down there and why a peaceful conference turned into Tiananmen Square?" John met fire with fire.</p>
    <p>Giller didn't wither under his glare, in fact his own hardened under it. "Three men hijacked a news van and use forged papers to get within the perimeter. We are still investigating their identities."</p>
    <p>"Do you know who was behind it?"</p>
    <p>"We are still *investigating*." And would be every time he asked, John bet. Couldn't be sharing information with the enemy, now could they. "Now would you care to explain yourself?"</p>
    <p>"We were under fire, we had wounded, Moya was closer. And I wasn't about to let Aeryn be taken to a hospital."</p>
    <p>"She would have been cared for with the others."</p>
    <p>"In twice as much danger of being kidnapped herself to be someone's personal lab rat," John snapped back. Giller's nostrils flared, reminiscent of a fairy tale
    dragon about to fry his enemies to a crisp. Bring it on, John thought. He was more than ready.</p>
    <p>"You -!"</p>
    <p>"Mr. Giller," Regie interrupted over the other's rising voice. "To be fair everything happened very quickly. It was a snap decision and I'm sure the Commander will be more than willing to return us at the earliest convenience."</p>
    <p>Giller's lips thinned. "We would like our people back on the ground today."</p>
    <p>"When Jool gives the okay for the wounded we'll be happy to drop them off," John told him. There was a pause.</p>
    <p>"That's acceptable," Giller finally conceded. "How long will that be?"</p>
    <p>"Couple days maybe."</p>
    <p>"You have two days."</p>
    <p>"Or you'll what? Blast us with your photon torpedoes?"</p>
    <p>"Gentlemen, please," Regie interrupted once more, his diplomat sensibilities taking over. Scott and Henley, Jeremy's First Contact replacement, shifted uncomfortably.</p>
    <p>"Two or three days. We'll let you know," John repeated lowering his voice.</p>
    <p>"Thank you," Giller grated out. "Now, why didn't you respond to our calls yesterday? We were very worried about our people, especially the embassies of the ambassadors in your escort."</p>
    <p>"Sorry." John hadn't spared much thought for the folks waiting back home. "I was busy."</p>
    <p>"Commander Crichton, as you are aware, is the only English speaker aboard," Regie cut in before Giller had a chance to attack.</p>
    <p>"And the translator?" Henley hesitantly yet hopefully asked. Even as John's gut clenched, Giller turned his frosty gaze on her, but waiting for an answer, Henley didn't notice.</p>
    <p>"She was indisposed," Regie replied smoothly. John glanced at him sideways, grateful he hadn't said anything about Rhia. Giller could draw his own frelling conclusions.</p>
    <p>"I see," the bastard said. "Very well, that brings us to the matter of you being armed."</p>
    <p>"If you want an apology, you won't get one. It was self defense."</p>
    <p>"You broke our trust by coming to the meeting armed!"</p>
    <p>"If all had gone well you would never have known. It was only a precaution, and apparently a necessary one in light of your screw-up!" John was sick and tired of having to defend his desire to stay alive.</p>
    <p>"Commander Crichton!" said Regie, ever the peacemaker.</p>
    <p>"It doesn't matter," John went on bitterly. "After we drop off your people, we'll be leaving anyway." There was no home left for him on Earth, that much was clear. Giller smiled, tight and cold, probably skippy-dancing in his head.</p>
    <p>"Leaving?" Henley however jolted upright in shock. "We were under the impression that you would stay."</p>
    <p>"You know what they say, assuming makes an ass out of you and me," John replied.</p>
    <p>"But you *can't* leave!! There's so much we can learn from you!" The woman was indignant. "I've been charged with offering you and the aliens a formal invitation on behalf of The IASA First Contact Commission to stay on Earth. We are prepared to take all security precautions, including a press ban to ensure your safety. We will not have a repeat of yesterday's incident, that's a guarantee!"</p>
    <p>"And cashing in the warranty might cost me my life," John retorted. Stay! That was insane. Moya's crew, if sometimes crazy, was not stupid.</p>
    <p>"But you can't leave after giving us an unexplained taste of a galaxy we will never see!" She looked ready to tear John apart, angrier than even Giller had been earlier at his blasphemy. "You come here bearing gifts only to take them away!?" her voice rose shrilly. "IASA is offering you a paid position, benefits. You'll be home with your family, working for the good of Humanity. 'One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind!' That is you! You cannot turn away!" Her face was as red as her words were fierce. Knowledge: that's what she wanted, the keys to the universe.</p>
    <p>"I've had enough brain surgery for one lifetime, thanks," said John quietly. He felt distanced suddenly from Earth, as if he saw it through a tunnel. "Giller, if there's nothing else you want to shout about, we'll contact you within the next day or so about when we'll drop your people off."</p>
    <p>Mr. Giggles choked out a, "Very well," through clenched teeth, then Pilot broke the connection. John turned to Regie who's face was clean of all emotion.</p>
    <p>"At the meeting yesterday you mentioned a war," he said. "If you are leaving in two days, I would like you to brief me in as much detail as possible."</p>
    <p>John sighed and leaned back against the table. Knowledge about space technology, about wormholes, about the war that always loomed on the horizon. It was all the same.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>D'argo stared at the scene before him in disbelief. Whoever's idea it was to let eight Humans loose in the secondary hangar was going to have to do some fast talking if he - and D'argo suspected either John or Filalla, who had taken a somewhat bizarre interest in Crichton's species - wanted to escape the Luxan's wrath. They were crawling all over the half destroyed transport pod like children, touching systems the crew was in the middle of carefully dismantling for spare parts. From this mess, it would take weekens to put everything back in order! And Medri was just letting the frelling Humans play, twirling a wrench as if watching a cycle's worth of work destroyed was nothing to get upset about.</p>
    <p>"Medri!" D'argo shouted across the hangar to get his attention. The spotted man jumped slightly, the wrench stilling in his hands. "Who the frell let them in here?"</p>
    <p>"Chiana. And they're just looking," Medri replied turning back to the Humans. "She's making sure they don't touch anything important."</p>
    <p>Looking over again, D'argo finally noticed the Nebari near the back landing leg talking with the man who'd attached himself to her earlier. Her surveillance seemed to be limited to the conversation. Making sure they didn't touch anything! Yeah, right! One glance at Medri and D'argo resisted the urge to knock him on the head. He was Chiana-watching again and to hezmana with everything else.</p>
    <p>"Medri!" he snapped again.</p>
    <p>"What?!" This time the spinning wrench didn't stop as the spotted man acknowledged him, annoyed.</p>
    <p>"Anything they mess up, you get to put back in order! I am not cleaning up after them."</p>
    <p>Medri waved an unconcerned hand at him and turned back to Chiana. Rolling his eyes at the younger man, D'argo left in disgust. It was like talking to a wall.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Aeryn grit her teeth against the pain, her headache getting worse with each jarring step she took. But with Jool beside her silently waiting for her to ask for help, she held it in as she'd been trained and worked through it. After arguing for the better part of an arn, there was no way she was going to eat her words. She'd frelling won and was going to make damn sure the whiny brat knew it. Though at the moment, Aeryn was beginning to wish she'd let herself be convinced otherwise. She stole a glance at the Interion who simply raised an eyebrow.</p>
    <p>Frell them! Aeryn glared at the DRD Pilot had insisted on and ignored the sheen of sweat she could feel on her brow. She was *not* going to be an invalid!</p>
    <p>In the distance, Aeryn heard the low hum of voices coming from her tier and sighed in relief. Almost there. One foot after another, that was all she had to do: ignore her throbbing head and shoulder and simply walk. She could do that, and if she couldn't she would die trying. From the pain, she was halfway there already.</p>
    <p>They had just turned down her tier, when the voices coming from the kids' room stopped and transformed themselves into the patter of feet. First Seth then Essor then Rhia burst into the hallway, breaking into a run when they saw her with happy cries. If Jool hadn't been there to steady her, they would have knocked her over. Aeryn let the babble of little voices wash over her as she regained her balance, a medicine of it's own kind that while good for her spirit wasn't as good for her headache.</p>
    <p>"Quietly, quietly," she patted heads, calming them.</p>
    <p>"Grandpa's spent the who'e day with us! Can you play with us too now?" Seth asked.</p>
    <p>"I think your Mom needs to rest now." Jack Crichton approached from the kids doorway, a thin book in his hands. "You shouldn't be up and about," he told Aeryn, throwing a disapproving glance at Jool.</p>
    <p>"Don't look at me. I tried, but she wouldn't listen," Jool said in her defense.</p>
    <p>"I'm not an invalid," said Aeryn, annoyed by their fussing. "I know my limits."</p>
    <p>"Right, death," Jool muttered. The ex-Peacekeeper glared at her.</p>
    <p>"Come on, let's get you to bed. Standing out here arguing is not helping matters any." Jack came up and put an arm around her waist, easily batting off her attempts to brush him away. "Stop. You're as pale as a ghost and you need rest. You should be taking better care of yourself," he admonished.</p>
    <p>So Aeryn let him help her to her room and onto the bed; the kids trailed behind with Jool who sighed in relief. When she was finally safely installed and given an I-told-you-so by Jool, the Interion left, leaving Aeryn alone with Jack and the children who'd gathered around her knees at their grandfather's insistence.</p>
    <p>"You really should be in the medical bay," he said again, his tone much like John's when she did something he disapproved of.</p>
    <p>"I prefer recuperating here," Aeryn replied, slightly defensive.</p>
    <p>"Will you read the story now?" Rhia asked Jack before he could reply to that. With a last lingering look at Aeryn, Jack nodded and accepted the small book Rhia held out to him. John had made it, along with fifty others over the years for the children. He'd written the stories in both English and the intergalactic script and illustrated them. The pages had been sewn together then bound with leather from old Peacekeeper uniforms.</p>
    <p>Aeryn closed her eyes as Jack began to read, recognizing the story as soon as she heard the first line. It was a favorite of the kids about a cargo hauler that had to pass through the edge of a gravity well to bring food and toys to a planet's children on the other side before morning. The poor cargo hauler isn't strong enough to make the journey, so the toys aboard contact three other haulers and ask them to take them through the gravity well. The first two refuse, but the third small one says it will try, and succeeds, repeating 'I think I can' as it passes through the well.</p>
    <p>"And as they flew into the planet-rise, the Little Hauler was heard to say, I thought I could, I thought I could, I thought I could," Jack finished, a slight smile on his lips. "You know, that was one of John's favorite stories when he was a boy," he told them, closing the book. "I can remember reading it to him every night for almost a year." Aeryn smiled. That sounded about right, she thought looking at her children.</p>
    <p>"Let's get another!" Rhia yelled, making Aeryn wince at the noise as they scampered off.</p>
    <p>"Do they have any Sebacean stories?" Jack asked when they were gone. Aeryn shook her head.</p>
    <p>"I grew up in a military barracks," she said by way of explanation. Her bedtime stories had been of battles and long dead Peacekeeper heroes who'd sacrificed their lives for the mission. They weren't stories she wanted to pass on to her children. "My childhood was very different. When Rhia was born, I didn't have the least idea how to be a parent."</p>
    <p>Jack smiled. "That's perfectly normal. I can remember feeling both overjoyed and terrified when John was born. But you learn fast. You and John have done a fine job. Whatever else, I'm very happy I've had this chance to meet you and my grandkids." Jack glanced towards the open door. He was different from the Ancients version Aeryn had met, older and more careworn, but at the same time he had more of a presence, more humanity. He was much like John - or rather John was like him.</p>
    <p>"I'm glad I've finally met you, too," Aeryn said. "John thinks very highly of you. Sometimes you were all he had to hold onto." Jack looked at her sharply, eyes searching hers. She held them, sensing the undercurrents she'd felt in John when he had come to see her earlier.</p>
    <p>A flurry of arms and legs tumbled into the room, arguing over three books they each wanted read and drawing both Jack and Aeryn's attention. "Hey now, we'll read them all," Jack said pulling Seth and Essor apart.</p>
    <p>"Mine first!" "No, *mine*!"</p>
    <p>"Let's go in the other room and decide," Jack stood and pushed them towards the door. "Your mom needs rest." Aeryn smiled and watched them go gratefully. At the door however, Jack paused. "Thank you," he said smiling warmly. Aeryn nodded, not sure what he was thanking her for.</p>
    <p>******************************</p>
    <p>Chapter 4: Return to Sender</p>
    <p>******************************</p>
    <p>"So what's the scoop?"</p>
    <p>Shannon looked up from her notes at Dave and Henry who were waiting by the van. The press conference had been called a day early and the two equipment men had been unluckily taking a coffee break from their vigil at Canaveral. "Big news," she said with a grin. "Tomorrow morning, Crichton is returning the kidnapped delegation."</p>
    <p>Finally something to work with! The only thing they'd had in the four days since the conference and subsequent shooting was the investigation and the influx of personnel on the Cape. The authorities weren't making very much progress. The descriptions and dental records hadn't turned up any terrorists or criminals and no groups had claimed responsibility. The police had broadcast the sketches the night before, hoping someone would recognize one of the would-be assassins, but so far nothing.</p>
    <p>It was actually the international and political press that was getting all the headlines as a result of the attack. Failed negotiations in Israel and Russia, and political tension making itself felt in the economic sector in Europe and Japan had sent out rumbles over the last couple of days.</p>
    <p>Shannon had done a short piece on local reactions but, all in all, it wasn't very exciting. The religious right was throwing a party and the pro-alieners were preparing for the Second Coming. But now, *finally*, something to sink her teeth into!</p>
    <p>"Camera's going in?" asked Dave.</p>
    <p>"No. That's the bad news. There's still a five hundred meter perimeter around the runway and all the meetings are closed to the media this time at Crichton's insistence." She waved the restricting document from the press packet. "Security. IASA is approving their archivists to do the video recording and they'll feed out the landing live. The rest we'll get at the press conference Saturday after the aliens leave again."</p>
    <p>"Crichton staying?"</p>
    <p>"IASA's offered him a position. I talked to Gary Wolfe but apparently they haven't gotten a definitive answer yet. We're going for drinks later so I'll find out what's happening then." Shannon shrugged out of her suit jacket and laid it over the front seat's open window.</p>
    <p>"He's considering *not* staying?" Henry asked, offering Shannon a cup of coffee.</p>
    <p>She accepted happily, turning and looking back at the IASA building complex. "Apparently. Makes for a good story, doesn't it?"</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>DK looked around the messy room in amazement. Four days and they had used up all of John's paper and moved on to the chips the crew used to store information with notes on anything and everything they could get their hands on. Now Tony was organizing their data for the ride home to make absolutely sure nothing got lost.</p>
    <p>"I still wish they would have let us take DNA samples of everyone," Dr. Amelia Hargrove commented joining DK and Jeremy where they were alphabetizing diagrams. "Especially the children. Just think, a successful crossbreeding of a Human with another species. I'd give anything to study them!"</p>
    <p>"You want to kidnap them and plug them into a computer?" DK asked sarcastically.</p>
    <p>Amelia waved a nonchalant hand. "Bad choice of words. I'd never run direct experiments on them, you know that. But a DNA or blood sample is not asking much. John Crichton gave us one when he landed."</p>
    <p>"But you're talking about his kids. It's not very surprising that he was against it," DK argued.</p>
    <p>"His kids, the only half-Humans in existence," Amelia retorted. "It's not an opportunity to pass up. Who knows what we could find in their genes that would benefit mankind: natural antibodies to cancer cells or AIDS. Anything."</p>
    <p>"Don't tell me you're not curious, DK," Jeremy said with a teasing smile. "You have to admit it's pretty cool."</p>
    <p>DK shrugged. He could see the logic of Amelia's argument: taking a blood sample wasn't anything a regular checkup wouldn't do. And he was curious, he admitted a tad guiltily. "John seems pretty touchy on the issue."</p>
    <p>"Touchy like a hair-trigger," Jeremy snorted. "He bit my head off when we brought it up. And all I asked for was a DNA sample, no tests or experiments or anything. Said he'd kill the first person who touched them." Jeremy ran a hand through his hair. "You know, DK, I don't know about him anymore. Threats and violence? That's not John. I'm actually uncomfortable around him now and we used to be great friends."</p>
    <p>DK had felt it too, that distance of two lives gone in different directions. The few conversations he'd had with John had turned flat and ended in a heavy silence after they had exhausted the small talk. Neither one of them knew how to take the first leap beyond the what's-happened-to-who-in-the-last-ten-years. John was unwilling to talk about his life, and for his part DK didn't want to talk about his. How did he tell John he'd quit IASA after the investigation to live off squat for a year and a half? That at the time, he'd blamed John?</p>
    <p>"So are you and Colonel Crichton really staying for a few extra days?" Amelia changed the uncomfortable subject.</p>
    <p>"Yep," DK nodded. He hadn't expected the offer but he certainly wasn't about to turn it down. With fewer distractions, he and John would be able to talk and hopefully find their footing again. "Jack was thrilled to have more time with his grandchildren, and I figure I can keep researching the technology up here. Figure out that hetch drive," he added with a wry smile. It had become a running joke that even after ten explanations, they were no closer to understanding the damn thing than they had been on Earth. But then, DK reflected, thinking of that awkward moment when John had asked him to stay, that was true of everything up here.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Ryan wasn't sure if this had been a good idea after all. The tension between John and Melanie was palpable as they faced off, each one sizing the other up. Part of him was still amazed his wife had agreed to come to the meeting at all given that since his arrival, she'd completely ignored her brother's existence. But here they were: tongue-tied and with matching unreadable expressions.</p>
    <p>"Hi," John finally said awkwardly. Melanie didn't answer, preferring instead to simply glare. "How are you?" John pushed forward.</p>
    <p>Melanie stared a moment longer then shook her head. "This was a mistake," she said turning for her purse that was lying on the couch. "I don't know why I came." She started for the door, but John caught her arm. Mel shook his hand off as if she'd been burned.</p>
    <p>"That's it?" he demanded. "You were just going to say 'hi' and leave?"</p>
    <p>"What else is there to say, John? 'Hi, how are? How's life been while I was *dead*?!"</p>
    <p>"How 'bout I'm glad to see you?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, because that would solve all our problems now wouldn't it! Don't expect me to worship the goddamned ground you walk on with the rest of the world," Melanie bit back caustically.</p>
    <p>John looked at the ceiling briefly. "Great. I haven't seen you in ten cycles and already I've pissed you off. What could I have possibly done?"</p>
    <p>"What do you think?!" Melanie shoved him back a step, her voice rising in anger. "You *died*. You went up in your little spaceship and didn't even say goodbye! 'Don't worry, Mel, I've been in space before. We'll go out for Mexican when I get back!' Well guess what, you never *came back*!"</p>
    <p>"I'm here now."</p>
    <p>"You arrogant asshole! You come back from the dead and think everything will go back to normal! Well it doesn't! We buried a goddammned box with your name on it! What gives you the fucking right to be alive again?!"</p>
    <p>Her words lingered in the air, as she and John stared at each other, their hard expressions mirror images of stubborn anger. Finally, John said softly, "I didn't die."</p>
    <p>"You died for me, you bastard! You died for me and Lisa and Dad and every fucking person on this planet!"</p>
    <p>"And I can't change that! I can't frelling change what happened! What else do you want from me?!" John gestured in frustration with his hands.</p>
    <p>"I wanted you to be there, goddammit!!" Melanie's voice cracked. "You were supposed to be there for my wedding, when Steven started drinking, when my kids were born, for Lisa's... You were supposed to be there!!" Angry tears pooled in her eyes and spilled onto her cheeks, but she ignored them. "You were supposed to be there but you weren't! Just like you weren't there for Mom!" She spat the words like poison, and John flinched as if he'd been slapped. "It would have been better if you'd just stayed dead!"</p>
    <p>Roughly, Melanie wiped her tears away and pushed past John for the door, slamming it behind. In the sudden silence, John remained where he was, still as a statue, staring at the floor where Melanie had stood. Ryan looked over at Lisa who was as stunned as he.</p>
    <p>"John?" she asked tentatively.</p>
    <p>He looked up at them, eyes blank and obviously on other things. His lips twisted into the semblance of a smile for a brief second. "I hate coming back from the dead," he said, then turned and strode out the door, leaving them to wonder what he meant.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"In conclusion, it's a violent, total war out there. You saw some of the images Crichton gave me... unspeakable horrors that rival our worst. I don't know whether, even with Crichton's help, we would ever be prepared for a spatial attack. The good news is that we are really far out, and it's unlikely that the Scarrans, Peacekeepers, or Nebari will come here in the near future," said Ambassador Reginard. "I'll have all the details typed up as soon as possible for you."</p>
    <p>"It can wait till tomorrow," Landers told him. He was at the debriefing unofficially as it was, and the poor man looked beat. Small wonder after his four day crash course in intergalactic politics, his express flight to Washington that morning, not to mention the stress of the attack and consequent space walk. Landers could only imagine what it was like, but he doubted he even came close.</p>
    <p>Reaching into his pocket, the president pulled out his bottle of Excedrin. "Catch," he tossed it to Reginard who stared at it a second before opening the bottle and taking two of the white pills. Modern medicine at it's greatest, thought Landers, as the ambassador returned the bottle.</p>
    <p>"So what kind of technology are we looking at?" he asked. "Weapons and defenses?"</p>
    <p>Reginard shook his head. "You'll have to ask your IASA liaison about the technology the scientists gathered. However, Crichton's head is a storehouse of information, and from what I saw on Moya, he's very good at adapting what he knows to serve his purposes. The original Farscape Module he built here on Earth for his experiment has been completely changed to meet the fuel and speed requirements of the other galaxy. It's amazing what he's done with it."</p>
    <p>"So if we want to be able to defend ourselves, we need him on the payroll," Secretary of State Clermont clarified.</p>
    <p>"If we want it done well and efficiently, I'd say so, yes," Reginard nodded. "Nothing makes up for practical experience. But as I said, I don't think we'll even be discovered soon."</p>
    <p>That was the only positive thing in this whole mess, Landers thought. But whoever said they would simply use the technology against space invaders who'd most likely never come. With negotiations in the Middle East stalled, the cease fire in Kashmir rekindled, and mixed messages showing up on the CIA's radar, the US needed more than global good will to make up for what the blunder in security had cost them.</p>
    <p>"I understand IASA has offered Crichton a job?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir," answered Clermont. "Five hundred thousand a year to him and any alien that will stay."</p>
    <p>"Are any of them likely to?" Landers asked.</p>
    <p>"Crichton himself didn't seem too keen on the idea," Reginard replied.</p>
    <p>"Then we'll make him an additional offer he can't refuse," said Landers. He wasn't about to let a resource like Crichton go if he could help it. The man was going to help clean up the mess he made whether he wanted to or not. "I want it done by tonight." Landers' cell phone rang as Clermont made the note. Checking the number, it was Lewis.</p>
    <p>"Yes?"</p>
    <p>"Sorry to disturb you, Mr. President," his aide began, "but you wanted to know as soon as the investigation in Florida had anything."</p>
    <p>"Yes. What is it?" Landers stood and retreated to the corner for privacy.</p>
    <p>"The sentry that let the attackers through was bribed. Fifty thousand dollars in cash," Lewis reported. "The FBI is trying to trace it now."</p>
    <p>Landers let out a slow breath, not liking the implications. A sum like that wasn't inconsiderable for a lowly National Guardsman. "I want to know as soon as they find out who's money it is."</p>
    <p>"Richard's already standing by," said Lewis. "I'm meeting a friend for lunch so I'll be back at the office by 1:30 if that's all right."</p>
    <p>"Take all the time you need. I'll see you then." Landers hung up. If Lewis was ferreting him out more information, he could have the week.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>The mood in the center chamber was the most relaxed Jack had seen it since he had come aboard. Apart from Aeryn who was with the children, and John and D'argo who were on the planet, the entire crew was eating together for the first time. The elusive Rygel had even shown up, the alien Jack had seen maybe three times, bearing with dignity - and cutting comebacks of his own - the others' teasing. The food was still the same, but the preparation a little more creative changing the taste somewhat. Around the table, conversation hummed back and forth.</p>
    <p>"I'm just glad the Humans are finally gone," Medri sighed.</p>
    <p>"I thought you liked them," Emmerit looked curiously at the spotted man.</p>
    <p>"I did," his eyes flickered across to Jack and DK, "but so many of them at once got stressful."</p>
    <p>"I liked them," commented Chiana to no one in particular.</p>
    <p>"We *know* that." Fillala threw a piece of vegetable at her with a teasing grin. " 'Chiana, what's this called?'" he said in a high falsetto.</p>
    <p>" 'Chiana, will you show me how this works?'" Emmerit joined in.</p>
    <p>"Frell you!" the Nebari returned.</p>
    <p>" 'Chiana, can you scratch my back?'"</p>
    <p>"Hey, that's enough," Medri interrupted, smiling himself. But Jack noticed that his shoulders were tense. Of course, Jack didn't know the guy all that well. For all he knew it could be normal. He'd spent most of his time with his grandkids and Aeryn and consequently, aside from Jool, didn't know the others at all. He wanted to though, because by getting to know them, he got a glimpse into his son's universe. Maybe if he understood where John had been, they could heal the schism between them.</p>
    <p>*******************************</p>
    <p>Chapter 5: Wondering Weather</p>
    <p>*******************************</p>
    <p>All was quiet. The children were finally clean and asleep below with Speckles and Stipes standing guard. Most of the crew had retreated to their quarters to get some sleep before tomorrow crashed down upon them. On the Terrace, John sat alone against the wall staring off into space. He'd been there since he and D'argo had returned, Aeryn knew, wanting at the time to be alone. She watched him from the doorway, unnoticed for the moment, noting the grim expression that told her he was lost in thought.</p>
    <p>"Hey."</p>
    <p>John turned at the sound of her voice, a tired but genuine smile lighting up his face as she approached. "Hey," he replied softly, making a spot for her in front of him. Aeryn settled in, careful of her shoulder; John lightly wrapped his arms around her like a warm blanket, pulling her close. "You doing all right?" he asked, rubbing his cheek against hers.</p>
    <p>"Mmm. I was going to ask you the same question," Aeryn replied. She felt his chest rise and fall against her back. Outside, the stars shone brilliantly. To one side was Earth, huge and beautiful and, from this distance close enough to touch.</p>
    <p>"They want me to stay," John said finally.</p>
    <p>"Who does?"</p>
    <p>"Everyone: IASA, the government, my father..." he trailed off. In the quiet, Aeryn reflexively glanced at the planet. "They made me some offers, 'for the good of mankind' and all that crap. Oursler even shook my hand before we left, asking me to stay."</p>
    <p>"And what do you want?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"I've told you before, Aeryn, I'll choose you over Earth."</p>
    <p>"But what do *you* want?" she repeated. Earth was more than just another planet; it was his home, the place he was born. He had ties there that were stronger than he maybe cared to admit sometimes, but that were there nonetheless.</p>
    <p>John sighed, his arms tightening slightly and his breath tickling her skin. "I don't know," he said. "If I went back for good, it'd be a zoo. Even with agreements and precautions, there'd be the media to deal with, men in black to avoid, more attacks maybe. And with you and the kids it'd be even worse. I don't want to put you in that kind of danger."</p>
    <p>"Life on Moya is no safer. Every time we take on refugees or meet an armed ship..." Aeryn trailed off. "Remember when I first became pregnant, we wanted to find a planet to settle down on? Maybe this is our chance."</p>
    <p>"You're saying you want to stay on Earth?" Disbelief colored John's voice.</p>
    <p>Aeryn smiled, surprised a little by her own words. "I don't know. I don't trust the Humans any more than I did before, but listening to your father tell Rhia and Seth stories about you and your sisters when you were young...maybe we can work around the problems and give them that."</p>
    <p>"A childhood?"</p>
    <p>"Peace."</p>
    <p>They fell silent, each contemplating the other's words. Aeryn thought back over the meetings on Earth. Warmly, almost suffocatingly welcomed and almost cleanly away. She and five others wounded, only one with serious complications; they were lucky to be alive. This was usually John's type of suggestion, she realized suddenly, the suicidal one. Thinking of it that way, Aeryn wondered whether it was worth the risk. The Uncharted Territories, it was true, had become even more dangerous since the war, but they knew the terrain, and on Moya they even had a degree of control. The only one who knew Earth was John, and recent events had shown that even for him the rules had changed.</p>
    <p>Around them, the light dimmed bit by bit, then was gone as Moya passed into the Earth's shadow. The stars sharpened and clarified now that they didn't have to compete with the sun's light.</p>
    <p>"I saw Melanie this morning," John said suddenly. His voice was low, almost a whisper. "She wasn't happy to see me. Hates me for dying."</p>
    <p>"And Lisa?"</p>
    <p>"Lisa's Lisa. She takes what she can get and is grateful for it. Melanie can hate you forever."</p>
    <p>"Sometimes it's easier to hate than to forgive," said Aeryn. Behind her John remained silent.</p>
    <p>After a moment, he asked, "So what should we do?"</p>
    <p>It was Aeryn's turn to sigh, but carefully. Hidden by the shadows and wrapped in John's arms, this was where Aeryn wanted to stay, in this moment. But life never gave them easy choices. "I don't know, John. I don't know."</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>From the look on D'argo's face, he was crazy for even suggesting it. Under normal circumstances, John took that as a good sign, but in this situation he wasn't sure that it was.</p>
    <p>"You're not," D'argo asked for verification.</p>
    <p>"We don't know." John bit his lip, waiting for the hyper-rage. He wasn't disappointed.</p>
    <p>"How can you even consider staying on Earth?! You'll be locked in a cell before you even get off the transport pod!" D'argo shouted, angry but thankfully not lost to it.</p>
    <p>"We'd make sure it's safe," John told him, trying to reason, but it didn't work.</p>
    <p>"Safe? The meeting was supposed to be safe, John! Look what happened! You can't trust Humans!"</p>
    <p>"Can't trust me!" John retorted, getting a little angry himself. He knew it was his misplaced trust that had gotten Aeryn shot. He kept kicking himself in the head about it enough as it was.</p>
    <p>"You're different!" D'argo pointed a finger at him. "I trust you even when I know I shouldn't! But this time, I'm locking you up before you get yourself hurt!"</p>
    <p>"You know, all I wanted was your opinion."</p>
    <p>"You are frelling insane!"</p>
    <p>"It's Earth! My home planet! You once told me I'd regret it if I never went back!"</p>
    <p>"You went back. They tried to kill you. I think that's a pretty clear indication that it's not safe for you down there!"</p>
    <p>"People try to kill me all the time, D'argo! What makes this any different?!"</p>
    <p>"Arrrgggg!" the Luxan growled in frustration, turning away and kicking the wall. Better it than him, John thought. "What did Aeryn say?" D'argo demanded after he'd vented.</p>
    <p>"She didn't say no." John rubbed his eyes, a headache pounding against his forehead. D'argo stared at him in silence for several microts.</p>
    <p>"John," he finally said. The astronaut looked up with a sigh, hands resting on his hips. The Luxan fixed him with a stern look. "You and Aeryn are my best friends. I'd give my life for you and your children, and I'll respect the decision you make - even if that means tongue-ing you and locking you in a cell until we starburst the frell away, so I can respect it with a clear conscious!" Ultimatum given, the warrior stormed off, leaving John in a vacuum of silence.</p>
    <p>All things considered, he thought, it had gone pretty well. But D'argo was right, he was insane for even considering it. How could he go back now? How could he expose the children to that kind of danger? Better to just forget about it.</p>
    <p>"That is one being I would not want pissed off at me." John looked up just as DK walked in. "He looked ready to kill something."</p>
    <p>John snorted. "If he wanted to kill me, he would have done it." DK nodded in sympathy, taking the fact as exaggeration.</p>
    <p>"So why's he mad at you?" he asked, making himself comfortable in the closest chair.</p>
    <p>John considered how much to tell him, then told himself not to be stupid. This was DK. They'd been closer than brothers; he shouldn't be worrying about offending him like some stranger. "He's mad because Aeryn and I are thinking 'bout staying on Earth."</p>
    <p>"But that's wonderful!" DK's face lit up. "Shouldn't he be happy for you?"</p>
    <p>"In D'argo's book, staying on Earth is tantamount to suicide," John told him. "And I'm not sure he's wrong."</p>
    <p>DK opened his mouth no doubt to protest, but shut it again. "Yeah, I guess I could see that," he said.</p>
    <p>"Yeah," John agreed, sitting down himself.</p>
    <p>"But that's not going to stop you is it?"</p>
    <p>"We don't even know who was behind the attack, DK. What if it was the government? And there's more to it than that."</p>
    <p>"Like what?"</p>
    <p>John didn't even know where to begin with that one. "It's complicated."</p>
    <p>"How so?"</p>
    <p>"DK -"</p>
    <p>"Goddammit, explain it to me," DK suddenly snapped. "Jesus, John, you've spent the last five days avoiding me. We haven't had a real conversation since you've been back. Every time I even get close to asking about what happened to you, you change the subject or give me some vague bullshit! What is with you? Why did you even ask me to stay if you don't want to talk?!" DK looked at him, brow furrowed waiting for an answer. He too had changed since John had last seen him. "I'm your friend, John," he went on when John didn't say anything. "I may not understand or like some of the things you do, but I love you no matter what. You can *talk* to me and I won't turn away like D'argo there."</p>
    <p>John looked down, feeling guilty for doubting DK. Why had he asked him to stay? To try and find what they had lost? He wanted to tell DK but at the same time was terrified by the idea. How could John explain his life in the Uncharted Territories, the Ancients recreation, Scorpius, Harvey, the Farders' experiment? Talking of those things was difficult even with those who'd been there. How could he expect DK to understand? How could he explain how far he'd fallen without losing his friend?</p>
    <p>But he had to try or it looked like he'd lose him anyway. He had asked him to stay, he couldn't back out now.
    "I don't know where to start," he confessed, meeting DK's eyes.</p>
    <p>"Start with why you're afraid to come home."</p>
    <p>The most complicated question of them all. Where did he even begin? "I've had some bad experiences with coming home scenarios," John finally said. "In one I was locked up. When the others came after me their lives were forfeit in the name of science. I can't let that happen, DK."</p>
    <p>"But it won't happen," DK said earnestly. "Where did you get theses scenarios from?"</p>
    <p>John rubbed his lip uncomfortably. "The Ancients and Farders made them from my memories." DK's eyes widened.</p>
    <p>"How did they do that?"</p>
    <p>"I dunno, but it reminded me of what Humans are capable of."</p>
    <p>"But how could they get in your head?" DK asked again. John couldn't believe it! He was stuck on the science, completely missing the point. "No, really," said DK upon seeing his expression. "How did they get in your head? How do you know it really came from you, that they weren't just making it up?"</p>
    <p>"Because every face was a familiar face!" John snapped. "That's how I figured out their game after I thought even my Dad had betrayed me!" DK looked taken aback. "The second time everything kept getting more insane; with the Farders I got to watch the Humans torture my friends. I didn't even know if it was all in my head or only the Humans who weren't real."</p>
    <p>"But it's still not real. Just because there's the possibility doesn't mean that's what will happen." DK leaned forward resting his arms on his knees.</p>
    <p>John regarded him. Underneath that graying hair was still the same bright eyed scientist John had always known, believing the best of everybody. "Doesn't mean it won't either."</p>
    <p>"Is the glass half full or half empty?" DK asked, exasperated.</p>
    <p>"You don't get it, DK," John brushed aside the question. "I don't have trust to spare, not when Aeryn and the kids' lives depend on it. D'argo was right. It was a crazy idea!" He stood and started to pace.</p>
    <p>"We're Human, John. We learn from our mistakes."</p>
    <p>"So have I." And the price he'd paid for some of those lessons had been too high. "Look, DK, I know you mean well, but after the attack, what reason do I have to trust Earth?"</p>
    <p>DK stared at him a long time until finally he too sighed and stood up. "I dunno," he said, "but with all the shit going on right now in the world, I think maybe *we need* to be trusted to do something right for once." That said, he left.</p>
    <p>John stared at the wall, thinking. Before the Ancients he would have gone back without a second thought, but now... he'd been burned one to many times. And with his family on Earth either hating him or disappointed in him, John didn't think it was even worth it.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Medri stared at the walls of his quarters without seeing them, trying to figure out what was going on with Chiana. She hadn't stayed tonight, hadn't in fact since before the Humans had come on board. They hadn't even really talked to each other - there hadn't been a *them.* The more he thought about the last five days, the more he saw Chiana and her pet Human together in his mind. At mealtime, in the cargo hold, in the maintenance bay. *They* had been inseparable.</p>
    <p>Chiana and the Human. No, she wouldn't, Medri scoffed at the idea, but...she had been flirting. He'd seen her flirt before, of course - it had saved their lives on more than one occasion. But here on Moya, she didn't need too. Yet she had been flirting with the Human. A lot. Medri buried his face in his hands, worry clenching his stomach. What if...no...but... He just didn't know anymore.</p>
    <p>At mealtime, in the cargo hold, in the maintenance bay. In the maintenance bay they'd been standing so close together, so close. But that had been the cramped conditions, he told himself. If they were four times as big, a tiny voice piped up. But they hadn't done anything. There.</p>
    <p>Medri got up and began to pace off the nervous energy. He had to know. He didn't think she had slept with the Human, she wouldn't do that to Medri. But she had stopped talking to him. She had never done that before. Except after Kyrek... And what the others had said...</p>
    <p>Before he knew he had even decided, Medri was out the door and on his way to Chiana's quarters. He had to know. He had to ask. It was ripping him up inside.</p>
    <p>Chiana wasn't in her quarters, or in the center chamber. Medri thought about asking Pilot, but decided against it, not wanting everyone to know. Was she hiding from him? Ashamed? Did she not want anything to do with him now? Where was Chiana? Every mircrot that passed made him worry more, like a ratchet grip tightening over his heart. She wasn't in command either. She didn't go down to the planet, did she?</p>
    <p>"Whoa!" In his haste Medri rounded a corner right into Filalla. The three legged man grabbed onto him to keep his balance. "What's wrong with you?"</p>
    <p>"Nothing." Medri tried to move on in his search, but Fil's grip turned to steel.</p>
    <p>"You're frelling golden, you mentir! What's wrong?!"</p>
    <p>"Nothing!" Medri shoved him back, twisting out of the handhold at the same time. Nothing was *wrong,* he just had to know. Had to know what had gone on between her and that Human. He took off down the corridor, barely aware of where he was headed. Behind him he heard Filalla call out to Pilot, but then he was through the next door.</p>
    <p>Medri found Chiana in the cargo bay with Rygel. *Alone* with Rygel, part of him noted darkly, while the other hoped he was wrong.</p>
    <p>"What's the matter with you?" Rygel asked when he came in, but Medri ignored him.</p>
    <p>"Chiana, I'm sorry but I have to know," he locked eyes with the surprised Nebari. "Did you...do anything with him?"</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"Your Human. Did you do sleep with him?!" Medri repeated impatiently.</p>
    <p>"What? No," said Chiana. She laughed shortly, surprised by the question "Why would I sleep with him? I only guided him around Moya and answered his questions."</p>
    <p>"You spent the whole time with him!" Was she telling the truth? There was something different about her voice, wasn't there? Her eyes darted to Rygel like she was hiding something from him.</p>
    <p>"So?"</p>
    <p>"You did." He was sure of it now.</p>
    <p>"No!" Chiana said strongly - too strongly. Medri felt his heart break like a knife slicing through him, anger rushing in to fill the vacuum.</p>
    <p>"You did. How could you!" he shouted.</p>
    <p>"I didn't do anything with him," she denied again.</p>
    <p>" 'You answered his questions.' 'Scratched his back.' I may have missed it then, but I see it now!" Medri snapped. Hurt, betrayed, angry. "You frelling slept with him!"</p>
    <p>"I did not!"</p>
    <p>"Then what were those smiles for? Taking him to see the damaged pod? I should have forbidden you to talk to him after that!"</p>
    <p>"I'd like to have seen you try! We're not on your planet, Medri! I do not belong to you! *No one* orders me around!"</p>
    <p>"Maybe someone should, to keep you from spreading your legs for anyone that asks!"</p>
    <p>"And that would be you?!"</p>
    <p>"Does three cycles together mean nothing? I'm just another conquest to be cast aside?! Do you sleep with Rygel and Filalla when you get tired of me?! How many have there been?!"</p>
    <p>"None! But I wish there had!" Chiana yelled in fury. "You want to chain me to your bed and be your sex slave! Well, maybe I'm sick of it! Always checking on who I talk to or even smile at. I can't do *anything* without *you* in my frelling face. You call us *family*! Were not! Frelling me does not make me your wife!"</p>
    <p>"So what does it make you?" Medri shouted back. "A slut free to jump ship whenever you want?"</p>
    <p>"It makes me free of you! If you don't trust me, then stay away from me and stay away from Essor!"</p>
    <p>The words hit Medri like a fist. "Stay away from him?! I'm the closest thing to a father he has!"</p>
    <p>"But he's my son and your nothing but an exiled chauvinist who can't stand seeing a free woman! If you think every time I talk to another male means something, I don't want anything more to do with you!"</p>
    <p>Nothing more to do with him! Medri felt like he'd been shot all over. When had this happened? She hated him! Blinded by fury, Medri lashed out at her. He didn't remember much after that: rage, pain, terrible words of hate and anger like blasts to his heart. Shouts as the rest of the crew ran in, hands grabbing to pull them apart. Scratches, kicks, and finally, after a blow to the throat, blackness.</p>
    <p>****************************************</p>
    <p>Chapter 6: Here's Looking At You, Kid</p>
    <p>****************************************</p>
    <p>"It was amazing," said Peter. "The ship is actually alive, as in aware. The DRD's let her see and hear what's going on and she communicates through Pilot. We didn't get to meet him personally, only through a hologram."</p>
    <p>Dan shook his head and took a sip of coffee. If he didn't know Peter or hadn't seen some of the sketches they had brought back, he would have called him a liar. He wished he could have gone up with them, even at the risk of being shot. A living ship! That hadn't been in the tapes.</p>
    <p>"What were the aliens like?" asked Yora leaning in.</p>
    <p>Peter shrugged. "Most of them ignored us as much as they could. Filalla, the one with three legs, the gray woman Chiana, and this tall fellow that's green with yellow spots were the ones that showed us around and told us about the ship. They didn't think we were that bright," he chuckled.</p>
    <p>"I wish I could have been there!" said Yora.</p>
    <p>"And DK's still up there, lucky bastard," said Dan. Some people just got it all. "Did John tell you what it's like out there?"</p>
    <p>"No. He spent most of his time with Mr. Reginard, the State Department guy. From what I gathered, there's a conflict brewing out in the galaxy John was in, and they're worried about the bad guys coming to Earth. But from what Tyler told me, the threat's minimal."</p>
    <p>"Who's Tyler?"</p>
    <p>"The Canadian ambassador. He was in pretty bad shape after the attack and everything so Tony had him stick close to me for the first night," said Peter.</p>
    <p>"Even so, it must be incredible out there. What I wouldn't give to have that chance." Dan shook his head again and finished off his cup. To discover new planets and new races, that's what Dan wanted to do, go beyond the horizon just to see what was out there. John was incredibly blessed to have had that chance.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>DK was in his room filling in his notes when John rapped on the open door. His old buddy looked the worse for wear with scratch marks on his arms and a bruise forming on his wrist.</p>
    <p>"Hey. What happened to you?" asked DK. "You look like that time you got beaten up by half the basketball team in high school."</p>
    <p>John smiled and looked down at himself. "Yeah, I guess so," he said. "George Parks has nothing on Chiana though," the smile sharpened into a grin DK couldn't help but return.</p>
    <p>"Chiana did that? What happened?"</p>
    <p>"She and Medri had a fight then tried to kill each other," John told him. "Chiana said it's over between them so we're gonna break out the fire water for Medri. You wanna come?"</p>
    <p>Surprised by the invitation, DK's first reaction was to say no. He'd stopped heavy drinking a long time ago. Besides, he didn't know Medri or the others that well. "No, you guys go ahead," he said. "I don't want to intrude."</p>
    <p>"Come on, DK. You wouldn't be intruding. Please." And something in John's tone made him stop and look at what was really being offered. So DK nodded and followed his friend to the center chamber where the male crew was sitting around the table. No one commented on his arrival, D'argo simply handed him a cup along with John and poured the alcohol.</p>
    <p>It was a subdued group. Medri sat slumped over the table with his head in his hands, his yellow dreadlocks hiding his face from the rest of them. Some of his spots were more green than yellow from what DK assumed were bruises. When D'argo tried to pass him a cup, he shrugged away, acquiescing only when the Luxan forced a hand to take it.</p>
    <p>"You get the first toast," D'argo said setting down the jug. "Trust me, you'll feel better once you're drunk."</p>
    <p>Medri shot him a querulous glare, looking like any other guy with a broken heart. "Yeah right! I'll never feel better!" he spat out morosely.</p>
    <p>"Nope, probably not," John agreed amicably. "Now what are we drinking to?"</p>
    <p>Swollen eyes regarded him for a second, before the spotted man finally lifted his cup. "To love. In the end, it never means anything."</p>
    <p>"To love," the others echoed and drank, DK with them. It wasn't very good, tasting like cheap wine mixed with grapefruit, but it had enough kick to serve its purpose he supposed. Across from him, Filalla licked his lips in satisfaction.</p>
    <p>"We should do this more often," he said.</p>
    <p>"At Chiana's rate we ought to be able to," Rygel noted.</p>
    <p>"To Chiana," D'argo raised his cup for the second toast, "who has broken yet another heart."</p>
    <p>"To Chiana!"</p>
    <p>"I don't know what happened!" Medri moaned after they drank. "Everything was fine between us until we came here! Then she hates me and I don't know what I did. It's not fair."</p>
    <p>"Hate to break it to you, Spots, but life ain't fair," said John. "And love least of all."</p>
    <p>"And you would know," Medri retorted sarcastically, shooting him a glare. "You and Aeryn fight *all* the time!"</p>
    <p>John actually laughed at that. "In the beginning that's all we did. She was pretty messed up when it came to emotions." He raised his cup. "To Aeryn Sun, the most complicated, frelled up woman I've ever known!"</p>
    <p>"To Aeryn!"</p>
    <p>"But it never could have been this bad!" Medri's head fell into his hands again. "How could she do it? Spend all that time with the frelling little Human then say it's all my fault?!"</p>
    <p>"That, my friend, is Chiana for you," said D'argo. He took the jug and refilled everyone's mug. "When she feels trapped, she kicks out as hard as she can."</p>
    <p>"Complicated creature is the female," Filalla said to no one in particular.</p>
    <p>Then the commiserating began about the fickleness of women and their incomprehensible ways. Other break up stories were shared and toasted. D'argo spoke of a girl from his youth and his own affair with Chiana, Rygel his one true love that had been forbidden him by his parents. John told of when Alex left him for the job at Stanford, Filalla of the women he'd left for his work as a trader.</p>
    <p>DK listened, getting a comfortable buzz. They weren't really all that different from a group of guys on Earth consoling a heart-broken friend. They'd all loved and lost at one point or another. As the night wore on, DK found himself telling them about Jennifer, his last girlfriend who had told him he was gay before throwing a wooden statue at him.</p>
    <p>"Hey, D'argo tell 'em abou' Stanz," called John when he'd finished. After about ten drinks, the group was becoming more drunk than sober.</p>
    <p>D'argo shook his head in a shiver.</p>
    <p>"Stanz is a Zenetian that had the hots for D there," John began with a happy grin when D'argo remained silent. "Kept making passes, trying to get him to fly off with him into the sunset. D'argo had no clue. Turned out that Stanz was female and D'argo didn't even know it! His one true love, lost forever!" John crooned over their laughter. "To Stanz!"</p>
    <p>"To Stanz!" They drank, the laughter dying down.</p>
    <p>"Y'know," said Medri, his words slurring together, "I though' Chi was my one t'ue love. But now she's gone. Gone, gone, gone." He peered into his cup. "You don't know what that's like!" he suddenly sobbed. Two teardrops splashed onto the table. They rest were silent under the new, somber mood. Filalla laid a hand on his friend's back.</p>
    <p>"I los' Lolhaan, my wife," said D'argo after a moment. "She was murdered by her own brother 'cause she married me. She was Sebacean and Macton couldn't stand the thought of her contaminating the species. He's dead now," he added as an afterthought.</p>
    <p>"My wife died in childbirth." Filalla lifted his cup and drained off the rest of his drink. He stared at it for a minute before continuing. "I lost both her and my son. She was so beautiful."</p>
    <p>"I lost Aeryn once," John said next. "I killed her." That didn't make any sense, thought DK, but John didn't say anymore, simply held out his cup for D'argo to refill. "To those we've lost forever," he said.</p>
    <p>"Lolhaan and Jothee."</p>
    <p>"Silla."</p>
    <p>"Anise," Medri added. "My sister."</p>
    <p>"Danallal and Muilli, my crew," Filalla added.</p>
    <p>"Gilina," said John.</p>
    <p>"Edinnal." They all stilled at D'argo's quiet addition.</p>
    <p>"Stark."</p>
    <p>"Zhaan," said Rygel. John and D'argo both looked at the small alien solemnly.</p>
    <p>There was silence. "To those we've lost," John repeated softly. There were tears in his eyes.</p>
    <p>As they drank, DK wondered through the mist in his head who all these people were that evoked such respect. He didn't dare ask; the spell was too heavy to lift now. All he could do was drink in their honor. Alcohol was a good thing he decided. The revelation deserved another drink.</p>
    <p>Things became less coherent after that. DK found it harder and harder to focus on faces and voices, the alien sounds he was now accustomed to understanding became alien again the more he drank. He didn't know how long they sat around the table or notice when they started singing. Everyone, it seemed had a bar song to teach the others, and they were actually pretty good, DK thought, as good as any symphony on Earth in fact. They were a great bunch of guys. Really nice, even D'argo who kept slapping him on the back and telling him to sing louder. His voice hurt. And he needed to stop drinking, but one more cupful wouldn't hurt.</p>
    <p>The taste of grapefruit was the last thing DK remembered before passing out.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>It was late when Jack woke up the next morning. The noise from the center chamber had been just loud enough to keep him awake for most of the night. He'd
    asked Aeryn about it the evening before, but she had only shrugged and said they needed to get smashed, before she had gone to find Chiana. Jack didn't really know what was going on, hell, he hadn't even known Chiana was with Medri till after the fight. Coming to Earth had apparently caused more than one rift on the ship.</p>
    <p>With a sigh, Jack got up. It was pointless to try and sleep anymore, he was too awake now. What he needed was a cup of coffee, something he couldn't get on Moya. He almost wished they'd go home soon. He was getting too old to go traipsing around on a second's notice.</p>
    <p>The center chamber was quiet, empty except for Jool and surprisingly John. They were talking quietly over steaming bowls and didn't notice at first when he came in. Giving them space, Jack went over to the fridge to see what was new for breakfast. That was another thing he missed: variety. He was getting sick of the vegetables they'd been eating for the last week.</p>
    <p>"Good morning," said John when he joined them at the table. He had bags under his eyes and definitely looked paler than usual.</p>
    <p>"Morning," Jack returned. "I'm surprised to see you up after last night."</p>
    <p>"Jool's miracle hangover cure," his son picked up his bowl with both hands and took a sip. "Hot tea. Doesn't really work."</p>
    <p>"It does if you drink it before you go to sleep. Or you could not drink all night like a barbarian," Jool replied archly, standing. She took her bowl to the basin.</p>
    <p>Jack smiled. "Sound advice," he said.</p>
    <p>"Too late now," muttered John.</p>
    <p>Ignoring his grumbling, Jack poured himself a mug of hot water from the pitcher on the table and sprinkled in tea herbs from the box beside it. John grimaced when he opened the tin. "So why aren't you in bed sleeping it off if the hangover cure's not working?" Jack asked.</p>
    <p>"It's louder in our quarters," John told him dryly. "Besides I couldn't go back to sleep once I woke up."</p>
    <p>"Crichton," Pilot's image appeared on the hologram clamshell. John flinched again from the sudden noise. "The planet has responded to your call."</p>
    <p>"I'll be right there Pilot." John stood with his tea bowl. "Time to face the firing squad," he said with a sigh. "I'll be back soon, Dad."</p>
    <p>John left, followed soon after by Jool, leaving Jack alone with his tea and wondering what John wanted to talk to Earth about. He was tempted to go after him, but no, he was too old to go chasing him around the ship. He'd ask John later when he came back.</p>
    <p>Jack gazed out the window at the stars twinkling in the distance. He never imagined he'd be back in space again. He'd never imagined either that his son had survived all these years. Possibility, faith. Maybe it all meant something after all.</p>
    <p>Reginard looked at his office in despair. It was an absolute wreck. His inbox was overflowing from the backlog of paperwork that had accumulated in the time he had been gone. It was almost November now, he suddenly realized. The time since Moya returned on the 4th had gone by in the blink of an eye.</p>
    <p>He sighed and set his briefcase down on the desk. He needed to pick up Halloween candy on the way home. Find out if Debra would talk to him after he took off like that for Florida. So much to do, so little time. His brief stay on Moya already felt like years ago.</p>
    <p>He opened his briefcase and took out his planner; it was filled with meetings for the rest of the week. Secretary Clermont, the Defense Department, and the National Security Council just for starters. It would probably just get worse when IASA started sending in the technological information.</p>
    <p>A mid-level diplomat suddenly jumped up to Ambassador Extraordinaire because of one throwaway assignment. Funny how life turned out. If someone had told him a year ago that he'd be personally briefing the president, he would have laughed and said they were out of their minds. Probably what Crichton would have said about what happened to him, he thought. Now there was an interesting man. At times dark and closed off, at others funny and amiable. He'd never talked directly about what had happened to him over the years but from his explanations of the Scarran-Peacekeeper conflict, Reginard got the feeling he'd seen a lot of it personally.</p>
    <p>The phone rang and Reginard answered tiredly. "Yes?"</p>
    <p>"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Reginard, but Mr. Gamges is on line one," his secretary informed him.</p>
    <p>"Thank you," Reginard told her before switching lines. Morning phone calls from his boss, what was next? "Reginard, here."</p>
    <p>"Thomas, glad you're there. How's your first day back been?"</p>
    <p>"Fine, sir. I have a lot of work to catch up on."</p>
    <p>"Yes, well, you might not get that chance," Gamges sounded more pleased than he should have been. "This morning," his boss continued, "Crichton contacted Canaveral announcing his intention to stay on Earth."</p>
    <p>Oh. The news surprised Reginard. The last time he'd spoken to Crichton, he'd been dead set against the idea.</p>
    <p>"Since you are a member of the First Contact Team," Gamges said cheerfully, "Clermont wants you down there. You have the right to say 'no,' of course," but his boss' tone said that such a response would lead to a slow and painful death.</p>
    <p>Move to Florida. Work with Crichton and IASA. Reginard sighed inwardly. He wanted a vacation. "I'd be honored," he said.</p>
    <p>"Wonderful! I'll have the details sent to you right away." Reginard could hear Gamges racking up the prestige points in his head.</p>
    <p>"Thank you, sir," said Reginard. He replaced the receiver in its cradle, staring absently at the buttons.</p>
    <p>So Crichton was staying on Earth. He sat back in his chair, trying not to think of what exactly that would entail, but it was no use. If Crichton was coming home, he was going to need a few more of the president's Excedrin before long. He could feel the migraine forming already.</p>

    Section 12: Walkabout<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Despite his protests, Rygel did finally lead SG-1 to their rooms. The others branched off into other identical corridors early on, leaving them to the arrogant and disgruntled ramblings of the little alien. Ahead of him, Daniel valiantly tried to carry on a conversation, but he was having little luck.</p>
    <p>"But no one ever listens to me! I, who was the best dominar since Rygel the Thirteenth!"</p>
    <p>"I'm sure you were an excellent ruler," said Daniel. "But aren't the needs of a ship different than those of an empire?"</p>
    <p>Jack tuned them out again. They'd been going on for the entire walk about how Rygel got no respect. Well, Jack didn't get any respect either, but you didn't see him complaining. And did everything have to look the same here? Jack had tried to keep track of where they were in relation to the closest exit, but not only were there no markers at the many junctions but the halls were curved as well, disorienting the hell out of him. All in all, Jack was irritated.</p>
    <p>Though to be fair, it probably had more to do with the alternate reality thing than anything else. Teal'c and Carter were discussing it behind him in un-boiled down terms. Something to do with wormhole theory. Jack ignored them too until they reached their rooms.</p>
    <p>"So," he said after Rygel left them. The room was as bare and boring as it had been the first time. "Who wants to go exploring?"</p>
    <p>"Sir?"</p>
    <p>"Exploring, Carter. It is part of our job description." Jack enjoyed the slightly puzzled, more exasperated expression on her face.</p>
    <p>"Jack, you do realize that we will probably get lost," said Daniel.</p>
    <p>"Teal'c knows his way around, right?" Jack looked at the Jaffa who merely raised an eyebrow.</p>
    <p>"I will try to keep track of our movements, however this is a most disorienting place," Teal'c replied.</p>
    <p>"Right. No blaming Teal'c if we get lost," Jack nodded. "We can leave our heavy weapons here. I don't think they'll try anything, but be on your guard just in case - what?"</p>
    <p>Daniel was staring at him with a confused look. "Nothing. It's just . . . well first you're all gung hoe to find out more about this place and now you're leaving your P-90?"</p>
    <p>Okay, so it wasn't his normal MO, Jack could admit that, but really. "Do you see anything interesting to do in this room?" he asked, waving a hand to emphasize the complete boredom surrounding them. "And we'll still be armed in case anything happens. You're forgetting I like these people. They're my kind of people."</p>
    <p>"Your kind of people, sir?" Carter asked.</p>
    <p>Jack shifted under the combined gaze of his team. He was known for not liking most of the people they met, but these guys were definitely his kind of people. "They're not the smiles and knives type. You probably noticed that they don't exactly hide how dangerous they are. They haven't lied to us, they've kept us in the loop, trusted us with our weapons, and didn't leave their friends in what looked like a hopeless situation. My kind of people. So let's go already."</p>
    <p>Not bothering to hide their smiles, Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c followed him out.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Aeryn wasn't sure what woke her. In the quiet, she listened for a disturbance but didn't hear anything except Moya's normal hum. Beside her, John lay sprawled on his back, his left hand tangled with her right in a mess of loosely bound fingers. He was so peaceful in his sleep for once. Troubled dreams finally gave way to exhaustion and recent good luck. Aeryn knew better than to jinx them by hoping it would last.</p>
    <p>She closed her eyes but couldn't go back to sleep. Now that she was awake, her mind was working in overdrive, skittering over the last few days and John's ill-timed proposal. They better have the wedding soon before their luck broke. Aeryn smiled as she thought about their conversation in their cell, wondering if tomorrow was too soon. The wedding would be in Pilot's Den of course. Maybe they should wait until he and Moya were well enough to go back into space.</p>
    <p>Thinking about him made Aeryn want to go check on Pilot again. She and John had stopped by before, but now that she couldn't sleep she might as well go. She kissed John lightly then slipped from bed, pulled on her boots, and headed toward the Den.</p>
    <p>She was halfway there when voices floated down from tier nine. Pausing, Aeryn listened, smiling when she recognized two of the humans.</p>
    <p>"We should have turned right back there."</p>
    <p>"If we had, we'd be going in a circle."</p>
    <p>"No, we're going in a circle now. We took a left before and a left this time."</p>
    <p>"Hello," Aeryn called as they came into view. Jack O'Neill and Dr. Jackson both pulled out of their bickering in surprise.</p>
    <p>"See," O'Neill gestured at her while grinning smugly at his friend. "Left."</p>
    <p>"Whatever, Jack," his friend all but ignored him. "Aeryn, isn't it?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn was pleased he remembered. "Yes. What are you doing?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, just exploring," said O'Neill lightly. "Our room was kind of . . . dull."</p>
    <p>Aeryn nodded in understanding. Boredom was a constant companion. "Any luck finding entertainment?" she asked doubting they had. After all they seemed more lost than occupied.</p>
    <p>"We found this one room with sciency stuff that had Carter going gaga," O'Neill replied.</p>
    <p>"Wall to wall paper covered in equations," Jackson clarified for her.</p>
    <p>Aeryn nodded again. John's wormhole equations.</p>
    <p>"She and Teal'c are still there. I hope you don't mind." O'Neill's tone was almost challenging her to say that she did, testing the limits of their hospitality.</p>
    <p>Aeryn shrugged and resumed walking toward the Den, the humans joining her. "It's John's equations," she told them. "I'd be amazed if she could understand it."</p>
    <p>"Oh, she'll understand it," said O'Neill. "She's a theoretical astrophysicist. Knows lots of big words and stuff." Aeryn glanced at him wondering what one had to do with the other, but Jack just smiled. "Trust me. She's having the time of her life right now."</p>
    <p>"With equations? Half of which she probably can't read?" Aeryn asked in disbelief. At both O'Neill's and Jackson's nod she added, "Strange woman. Though it doesn't really surprise me."</p>
    <p>"Why not?" Daniel looked at her curiously.</p>
    <p>Aeryn smiled at the concentration she saw on his face and felt her guard slipping. She couldn't seem to not like them; they reminded her too much of John in each their own way. Which was why she really wasn't surprised by the woman's hobby. "Humans are strange." At the double look she got, Aeryn just smiled.</p>
    <p>"Strange huh?" O'Neill smiled back. "I guess."</p>
    <p>"Of course it's all about cultural context," said Jackson thoughtfully.</p>
    <p>"Daniel, shut up," said O'Neill quickly. "She doesn't want to hear about the cultural context of anything. Forgive him," he turned to Aeryn. "He's as bad as Carter when it comes to people stuff."</p>
    <p>"I'm sure he is. And I do understand," she told Jackson. "About differing values in different cultures. Living on Moya has been . . . "</p>
    <p>"Interesting?" Jackson offered.</p>
    <p>"Yes." She might have used a stronger word, but how did you explain this life to people who hadn't lived it?</p>
    <p>"So where are we going?" O'Neill asked in the silence that followed.</p>
    <p>"To see Pilot," Aeryn answered, glad of the change in subject.</p>
    <p>"The one that interfaces with the ship?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn looked at him in surprise, wondering what D'argo had told them. "I wouldn't call it interfacing," she said. "He and Moya are symbiotes."</p>
    <p>"Ah."</p>
    <p>"What?" Aeryn didn't miss the grimace that passed over O'Neill, or the look he shared with Jackson at the mention of symbiotes.</p>
    <p>"Nothing, really. Just another cultural difference," said Jackson. "In our reality most of the symbiotes we've encountered - "</p>
    <p>"Try to kill us," O'Neill finished.</p>
    <p>"Pilot won't kill you," Aeryn reassured them. "And even if he wanted to, he's too weak at the moment." The men nodded, but there was still a wary look in O'Neill's eyes. "And if you so much as think about harming him, I'll shoot you."</p>
    <p>O'Neill grinned. "If he's worthy of your loyalty, than I'm sure he's a good guy."</p>
    <p>"The best," Aeryn told him solemnly. One of her first true friends on Moya, with them through everything. She would do almost anything for him.</p>
    <p>"So does he have a name other than 'Pilot'?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn shook her head. "His language is too complex for anyone other than Pilots and Leviathans to understand, so his true name doesn't translate."</p>
    <p>"So how do you communicate?" asked Jackson.</p>
    <p>"He simplifies his speech for the microbes," said Aeryn. "We're almost there."</p>
    <p>Around the next curve was the door to the Den. Aeryn leaned over to hit the door mechanism and led her companions in. From their muted expressions of awe, she could tell they were impressed. The Den was a huge cavern with a ceiling that extended hundreds of metras up and a floor covered in bat dung hundreds of metras below the walkway on which they stood. All around was empty space and in the center was Pilot at his console. At the moment, his purple shell head hung in weariness, closed eyes opening when they three of them entered.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn," he breathed happily.</p>
    <p>"Hello, Pilot," she smiled. Upon reaching his console, she climbed up and sat next to him. "I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd drop by."</p>
    <p>Pilot had a look of soft surprise on his face at her unexpected concern. He really shouldn't have been, but Aeryn knew that was just the way he was: always there, always called upon, and asking nothing in return.</p>
    <p>"This is Colonel O'Neill and Dr. Jackson," Aeryn introduced the men behind her who had recovered from their own surprise of meeting Pilot.</p>
    <p>"Call me Daniel. It's a pleasure to meet you," Daniel said softly, approaching the console and offering a hand for Pilot to shake.</p>
    <p>"Jack," the Colonel waved, nodding to Aeryn as well.</p>
    <p>"They're the ones from the unrealized reality," Aeryn continued.</p>
    <p>"Yes. O'Neill destroyed one of my DRDs," Pilot leveled a half-hearted glare at O'Neill - Jack - who looked bewilderedly to Aeryn for an explanation.</p>
    <p>Aeryn regarded him neutrally, not wanting Pilot to see her amusement. "He said you destroyed a DRD."</p>
    <p>"Sorry," Jack had the grace to look sheepish. "I got a little carried away."</p>
    <p>"It's all right. Just don't make a habit of it," Aeryn replied.</p>
    <p>Pilot shot one last glare at Jack before turning back to the woman beside him. "Why couldn't you sleep?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn glanced uncertainly at the humans who watched them a little uncomfortably. Wondering if she trusted them enough. She must on some level, otherwise they would be locked in their room and not chatting with her and Pilot here. And even though they had just met, she found that she liked them. They would find out soon enough anyway, she reasoned, especially if they were stuck in this reality which John said was probable.  So justifying herself, she answered in English. "I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about having the wedding before our luck changed. And wondering when that would be."</p>
    <p>"I see," said Pilot gently as he extended a claw which Aeryn took gratefully.</p>
    <p>"What?" "Uhh. . ." Jack and Daniel both looked a little stunned. Daniel managed to lift his jaw off the floor first. "You're getting. . . uh. . . married?" he asked as politely as he could with a slight hand movement at he two of them.</p>
    <p>And suddenly Aeryn imagined what she and Pilot must look like, sitting close together, holding hands as familiar as lovers. She couldn't help the burst of laughter that broke its way free, nor the one that followed. Pilot regarded her strangely and asked what was wrong, but Aeryn didn't have the breath to answer. After a hundred microts, she pulled herself together. It really felt good to have something as simple as a misunderstanding to laugh at after the past few monens - the past cycle even.</p>
    <p>"Care to share the joke?" asked Jack who looked a little put out at not knowing what was going on.</p>
    <p>"Pilot you know I care for you a great deal, right?" Aeryn turned instead to her friend.</p>
    <p>"Yes, but . . . oh." The puzzled look on Pilot's face cleared.</p>
    <p>"So you're marrying . . . ?" Daniel looked at her expectantly.</p>
    <p>Aeryn couldn't help but smile at his earnestness. "John." She turned back to Pilot. "I was wondering when wouldn't be too soon for you and Moya."</p>
    <p>"Anxious?" asked Jack with a sly grin.</p>
    <p>"Jack," Daniel frowned at his friend.</p>
    <p>"What? I mean who isn't anxious for their wedding day?" he said innocently leaving the rest unsaid.</p>
    <p>Aeryn resisted the urge to point out that that was hardly a problem. "Pilot?"</p>
    <p>"Whenever you wish, Aeryn Sun," said Pilot. "Moya and I will be proud to attend."</p>
    <p>"Thank you. So, tomorrow?" she asked hopefully.</p>

  content: She&#8217;d been thinking about it long before she picked up the phone.  It had been in the back of Abby&#8217;s mind since the computer had been rendered toxic ash, but at the same time Abby respected the Winchesters&#8217; need to be off the federal radar.  That&#8217;s why when she did make the call it wasn&#8217;t from work; it wasn&#8217;t even from her cell phone.  It was from a bus stop phone booth.  The fact that it was after two am and she was a block outside of a Not-Quite-Rave-But-Close-Enough and had seen a few too many Goths necking with their teeth also had a lot to do with it.<br /><br />It wasn&#8217;t really the Goth thing.  Abby was totally down with that.  It was more the two-weeks-ago-we-destroyed-a-haunted-computer feeling of surreality that had struck her at odd moments and had her wondering if ghosts were real, what else was?  Abby had always been open-minded, but she was also a scientist, and right now it was a little harder for her to reconcile the two.<br /><br />That guy had had really big teeth.<br /><br />The phone was not in the best shape, but it worked.  Abby dug into her purse to pull out that woman&#8217;s number who had first put her into contact with the Winchesters.  It took a few rings before it was answered, but she sounded awake at least.<br /><br />&#8220;Hello?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yes, hi,&#8221; said Abby.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you remember me but I called about a haunted computer a few weeks ago?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; the woman said cautiously.  &#8220;You get it taken care of?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yes.  Yeah, the guys helped us out,&#8221; Abby hastened to reassure her.  &#8220;Actually that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m calling.  You don&#8217;t happen to have their new phone number do you?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;New number?&#8221; the woman sounded surprised and nerves and guilt made Abby rush ahead.<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah.  I tried calling them again but it was disconnected and I really need to talk to them.&#8221;<br /><br />There was a long silence on the other end.  &#8220;What about?&#8221;<br /><br />The words stuck in her throat, too stupid to utter now that she had to.  Abby shook her head, the tips of her pigtails brushing her shoulders.  &#8220;Never mind,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not a big deal.  Look, thanks anyway.&#8221;  Speaking with this woman, Abby had never felt more like a . . .  a poser than she had since she first put on black lipstick in the fifth grade.<br /><br />&#8220;Where can I reach you?&#8221; the woman surprised her by saying before the phone was an inch away from her ear.<br /><br />&#8220;What?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You got a phone number?&#8221; the woman asked with a touch of exasperation.<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Abby gave her her cell number, and a minute later, after she&#8217;d hung up, was cursing herself for not just asking the woman about vampires.  Then she swore again as the chill of the night hit her all of a sudden.  The area was bright with lights and the music blared out of the club where the party was still going strong, but Abby couldn&#8217;t shake the feeling of someone watching her, waiting to sink teeth into her neck.  For once her morbid curiosity of what that would feel like was not buffered by the comfort of rationality.  Shaking away the shivers, Abby hurried to her car and home to the safety of her own coffin.<br /><br /><hr><br /><br />The call, when it comes, woke Abby up at one in the morning and it took a moment for her to register the sound of her phone vibrating on the night stand.<br /><br />&#8220;Wha-?&#8221;  She was much closer to asleep than awake when she answered.<br /><br />&#8220;Abby?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Who is this?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Sam Winchester.&#8221;<br /><br />The name jolted her awake and she sat up abruptly.  &#8220;It&#8217;s the middle of the night!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Sorry.  I had to wait till Dean was out.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Why?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;So what&#8217;s up?&#8221;<br /><br />Abby blinked hard, wanting to press about his brother but she could guess why Sam waited for him to leave.  Even knowing that he was probably innocent of most of what the FBI accused him of, he hadn&#8217;t struck Abby as very nice.<br /><br />&#8220;I am,&#8221; she said blinking her eyes again as she wiggles back so she could lean against the head end of her coffin.  &#8220;And you are,&#8221; she added.  &#8220;Obviously.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Why did you want to get in touch with us?&#8221; Sam sighed, reminding Abby that it was still late in whatever time zone he was calling from.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, right,&#8221; she said, feeling more stupid now than she had when tracking down his number again.  &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing really.  Nothing bad, I mean, no computers or ghosts or fanged ponies stalking me or anything.&#8221;  He waited quietly for her to talk herself out.  &#8220;Just . . . I was wondering about vampires.&#8221;<br /><br />There was a pause before Sam spoke.  &#8220;They&#8217;re real,&#8221; he said quietly.  &#8220;Most of them have been hunted down, they&#8217;re practically an endangered species, and the ones that survive try not to draw attention to themselves by killing people, but they&#8217;re around.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh.&#8221;  Abby didn&#8217;t think she was surprised except that she was.<br /><br />&#8220;What happened?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Nothing.  I was at a rave, except it wasn&#8217;t really a rave because the laser system broke down so there were no lights, and anyway, it ended up being lamer than a one legged man, and there were some seriously creepy people there.  And I don&#8217;t use the word creepy lightly.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Was anyone hurt?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No.  But after the computer attacked Tony and rewrote its own code &#8211; which was not creepy so much as spooky and beyond frustrating, like when your friends come in the middle of the night and put all your furniture on the roof, that ever happen to you? <br /><br />&#8220;No,&#8221; said Sam with a smile in his voice.<br /><br />&#8220;It sucks.  But I got kind of freaked out by all the Goth necking that was going on.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;So you tracked us down again.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Sorry?  Look I&#8217;m not going to turn you in or anything.  Your innocent and the FBI forensics people should be fired.  And the agent on your case because he&#8217;s an idiot.  You would be so much better off if you were being chased by NCIS.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;d much rather we weren&#8217;t being chased by anybody.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;But then you&#8217;d have Gibbs after you and he&#8217;s on your side.  No, really,&#8221; she added when Sam started to laugh.  It was a tired laugh but heartfelt, and Abby smiled at hearing it.  Their one meeting hadn&#8217;t given her the impression that he got a chance to laugh that often.<br /><br />&#8220;At least somebody&#8217;s on our side,&#8221; he said after a minute.<br /><br />&#8220;The best somebody,&#8221; said Abby.  A companionable silence trailed out between them.  Abby could still hear Sam breathing on the other end, a lifeline though she wasn&#8217;t sure which of them was reassuring the other.<br /><br />Finally, Sam cleared his throat.  &#8220;Was that all you needed?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Abby.  &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;  He lingered on the line for a minute or two longer, and Abby didn&#8217;t want to hang up first so she waited.  &#8220;Good night,&#8221; he said.<br /><br />&#8220;Night.&#8221;<br /><br />When he ended the call, Abby put her phone down but she didn&#8217;t go back to sleep immediately.  She wondered if he would throw his phone out now.<br /><br /><hr><br /><br />A few days later, Abby decided to give in and test her hypothesis by calling Sam back to see if he picked up.<br /><br />&#8220;Sam!&#8221;  She grinned, delighted.<br /><br />&#8220;Abby?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You didn&#8217;t throw out your phone!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Should I have?&#8221; Sam asked guardedly, less delighted than Abby that she had called.<br /><br />&#8220;No.  I just wasn&#8217;t expecting it.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ok.&#8221;  He sounded like Tim did when he was having trouble keeping up with Abby.<br /><br />&#8220;How are you?&#8221;  She hadn&#8217;t asked last time and felt like she&#8217;d failed her mother for not remembering the basic courtesies.  Sam was once again taken aback by the question and Abby just wished he would get over it already.<br /><br />&#8220;Uh . . . fine, I guess.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Just fine?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah?  Um.  How are you?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Very glad you didn&#8217;t throw away your phone.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Great.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;It is!  See now we can talk.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Right.  So, uh, was there anything you needed?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No,&#8221; said Abby.  &#8220;Just calling to see if you&#8217;d pick up.  I can come up with something if you want.  Like, are werewolves real?  Elves &#8211; ooh, leprechauns!  Are they real?  Like tiny little gnomes out to steal your gold and nip your heels.  I bet they tie your shoelaces together, too.&#8221;<br /><br />That got a laugh out of Sam.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go, Abby.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh.&#8221;  Abby rocked back on her heels.  &#8220;Okay.  But don&#8217;t throw your phone away.  I won&#8217;t trace it, I promise.  Or even tell anyone else.  Except maybe Gibbs because he tends to find out everything anyway, but he&#8217;s not out to get you so it&#8217;s okay.  Okay?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go,&#8221; Sam repeated, not committing one way or the other.<br /><br />&#8220;Okay.&#8221;  Abby wasn&#8217;t that disappointed.  He&#8217;d answered after all and that was something so he must trust her at least a little.<br /><br />&#8220;Well, bye.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Bye.&#8221;  It was another moment before the call ended, like Sam was waiting on her.  Abby held her cell in both hands, with a conspiratal grin on her face.  &#8220;Our secret, okay?&#8221; she told her phone.  Her phone was in agreement.<br /><br /><hr><br /><br />The next time Abby called Sam, she had a legitimate question.<br /><br />&#8220;So werewolves?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Real.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Silver bullets?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;In the heart.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Wow.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Not really.  In human form they don&#8217;t know they&#8217;re out every full moon killing people.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That sucks.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;<br /><br />It sounded horrible, and Abby wished she could see Sam.  He sounded like he might need a hug and that bothered her because she couldn&#8217;t give him one over the phone.  Instead with no other choice, she simply forged on.<br /><br />&#8220;What about leprechauns?&#8221;<br /><br /><hr><br /><br />It became a kind of game and Abby went through all the fairy tales and monster stories she knew.  Which was a lot.  By the time she had to resort to the internet, Sam was no longer thrown off by her calls.  He started talking more too, and their conversations began to fall into a pattern. Abby would quiz Sam and try to stump him.  Sam would editorialize and distill fact from fiction.  How ichors were different from humors and how sometimes neither one of them was blood.  Then, fascinated, Abby would ask more questions than Sam knew how to answer and end up explaining PCRs and Major Mass Spec and how TLC went a long way toward a maintaining equipment but she drew the line at ritual sacrifice no matter how tempted.<br /><br />He never talked about what he was hunting, never talked about his brother, never said where they were.  Sometimes Sam didn&#8217;t pick up, sometimes she heard Dean in the background and Sam would tell her to call back later.  He never called her.<br /><br />Abby didn&#8217;t talk about cases or the team and only called from home.  Each time after she pressed send there was a moment when she wondered if this was the moment she got the robot woman telling her that his phone was out of service.<br /><br />Then one day, two months in, it did.<br /><br /><hr><br /><br />It wasn&#8217;t until Gibbs didn&#8217;t leave her lab that Abby realized she hadn&#8217;t stopped thinking about it.  She was hot and her music was giving her a headache so she had shut it off, glancing at her cell that kept its promise and its secrets on the center of her desk.<br /><br />&#8220;What?&#8221; she asked Gibbs when he just raised an eyebrow.  &#8220;What, what?  Bullet, shell casing, murder weapon.  The end.&#8221;<br /><br />Gibbs just kept up the Stare of Doom, and Abby had promised, but this was Gibbs, and she had made an exception for him so it didn&#8217;t count as breaking it, did it?  &#8220;I&#8217;m worried about a friend,&#8221; she said finally.  &#8220;Not a boyfriend.  Just a regular friend who&#8217;s phone is out of service and I have no idea if he&#8217;s all right or got sucked into the sewers and eaten by a monstrous alligator.  That can happen, you know.&#8221;<br /><br />Gibbs took a hold of the finger she stabbed in his chest, squeezing it and letting it go.  &#8220;You think he&#8217;s in danger?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No.  Yes.  Maybe?&#8221;  Abby didn&#8217;t know; that was the whole problem.  &#8220;He deals with dangerous things, Gibbs.  Anything could happen.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What does he do?&#8221;<br /><br />Now she&#8217;d put her foot in it.  So much for anonymity, and by the way Gibbs&#8217;s head did the Tilt of Doom, he was picking up on her twining fingers and Squinch Face of Guilt.  &#8220;Dangerous things,&#8221; Abby repeated.  &#8220;With . . . animals and . . .&#8221; she closed her eyes tight, &#8220;haunted computers.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Abby.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Gibbs, I swear, he&#8217;s a really nice guy and it&#8217;s just him and his brother and I don&#8217;t think he really has any friends &#8211; it&#8217;s kind of sad actually, and I don&#8217;t even know how much of a friend I am because all we do is talk about monsters, and some forensics, but mostly monsters, and what kind of friendship is that?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Abs,&#8221; Gibbs&#8217;s hands settled on her shoulders, stopping the flow of words that felt like pure worry.<br /><br />&#8220;I only have his phone number,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;That&#8217;s it.  I&#8217;m the one that calls him.&#8221;<br /><br />Gibbs sighed, thumbs stroking her shoulders.  &#8220;There&#8217;s not much we can do except wait,&#8221; he said.<br /><br />Abby didn&#8217;t say that she was afraid she&#8217;d be waiting forever, but she had a feeling Gibbs knew what she was thinking.  &#8220;I hate waiting.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I know.&#8221;  Gibbs pulled her into a hug.  Abby hung on, grateful he was there, and prayed Sam was okay.  And his brother too.<br /><br />&#8220;They didn&#8217;t do any of it.  They&#8217;re just trying to help people.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Gibbs.  &#8220;I know.&#8221;<br /><br /><hr><br /><br />One day turned into two.  Two into a week, and then three weeks had gone by.  November had faded into December.  In NCIS-time that translated into five cases, nineteen hours of overtime, and four days off.  Abby tried the woman again but got nothing but a stone wall masking a worry of her own.  Abby didn&#8217;t have time to worry about Sam, but she managed to fit it in anyway.  After the first week she stopped staring at her phone every night.  Gibbs was right, there wasn&#8217;t anything she could do but wait, so Abby went back to work and life returned to its normal over caffeinated state.<br /><br />When her cell rang Thursday night, Abby answered expecting to hear Sister Gabriel returning her call after she&#8217;d had to bail on bowling.<br /><br />&#8220;Abby?&#8221;  It wasn&#8217;t Sister Gabriel.<br /><br />&#8220;Sam!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Hi.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Sam!&#8221;  Abby didn&#8217;t know whether to be shocked or surprised, but in either case she was very glad to hear his voice.  &#8220;You&#8217;re alive!  What happened?  Are you okay?  I was so worried.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We&#8217;re fine.&#8221;  He sounded tired but unworried.  &#8220;I had to destroy our phones,&#8221; Sam said.  &#8220;GPS.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;The FBI?&#8221; Abby asked.  &#8220;You&#8217;re not calling from prison, are you?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No, we&#8217;re not in prison.  It was someone else.  We had to ditch the phones and scramble our IDs, and it takes a little while to get set up again.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Who was after you?&#8221; Abby bit her lip, realizing only after the words were gone that she&#8217;d crossed a line that both of them had been careful to keep their toes behind.<br /><br />&#8220;Just . . . some guy that wanted me dead.&#8221;  Sam sighed.  The resignation and weariness released in that breath were palpable.<br /><br />&#8220;Close your eyes,&#8221; she said.<br /><br />&#8220;What?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m going to send you a hug but you have to close your eyes to get it,&#8221; said Abby, wishing she were there to give it in person, because dammit, no one should sound like that, like it was normal to be hunted.  &#8220;Are your eyes closed?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah, they&#8217;re closed&#8221;.  Sam thought she was ridiculous, she could tell, but right now she didn&#8217;t particularly care.<br /><br />Abby switched to speaker, wrapped her arms around herself, and closed her own eyes, concentrating.  &#8220;I&#8217;m sending it now,&#8221; she said.  She really, really hoped he did.  Not everyone could receive long-distance hugs, but she hoped Sam was one of them.<br /><br />After a long silence, Sam said, &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;  It was practically a whisper.  <br /><br />Abby let go and picked up her phone and Girtie the Giraffe, tucking her close.  &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome.&#8221;<br /><br />Sam was quiet and she heard him clear his throat a few times.  Abby stayed silent.  They were so far outside of their box, they were on a tightrope, and Abby didn&#8217;t think she could bear it if she slipped up.  Sam had called her.  With his new phone number when he could have as easily let her fall by the wayside.<br /><br />&#8220;Hey, Abby?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Do you think you could just . . . talk?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What about?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Anything.  I don&#8217;t know.  Something with a happy ending.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Abby, brain already chasing after a suitable distraction for him, anything to give him a break from a life that wouldn&#8217;t cut him one.  &#8220;You wanna hear about the first mystery I ever solved?  Well, it wasn&#8217;t exactly a mystery except for the answer being mysterious to me, but it was odd.  There was this old junkyard behind my house full of totaled cars and I was always trying to figure out what happened, but there was this one car, a 1983 Cadillac Cimarron that just didn&#8217;t make sense . . .&#8221;<br /><br />Abby talked for an hour, pausing a few times to make sure Sam hadn&#8217;t fallen asleep.  &#8220;I&#8217;m here,&#8221; he said each time, clear and wide awake.<br /><br /><hr><br /><br />After that things went back to normal.  Abby called every week or two and asked about the Apkallu and surtrs, and Sam would balk and tell her what lies the internet spread.  Every once in a while conversation would branch out to crazy things in the news that were true and not supernatural and from there merge into the world at large, poverty in Africa, and how fast Abby could wire a house.  It wasn&#8217;t just Abby being weird and Sam putting up with her any longer.  Somewhere along the way they&#8217;d become friends.<br /><br /><br />

    <p>"I still think it's a bad idea," said D'argo.</p>
    <p>"You think everything I do is a bad idea," John answered, smelling the armpit of his shirt before dropping it on the appropriate pile.</p>
    <p>"That's not true," D'argo denied. "I liked your idea of locking up the Humans."</p>
    <p>"That was your idea," John pointed out, almost smiling.</p>
    <p>"Yes, but you agreed with it!" D'argo waved his finger in triumph. He honestly couldn't remember who had decided to do it. Thinking about it now, it had probably been one of Filalla's. "John..."</p>
    <p>"D'argo, we're going." John gave him a look of quiet determination. "Aeryn and I talked about it -"</p>
    <p>"I still don't believe that *she* is going along with this!" D'argo threw up his arms in frustration.</p>
    <p>"I'm going along with it because it was my idea," Aeryn suddenly said behind him. D'argo turned in surprise and watched her drop the clean laundry on the bed before she turned to face him. "I know you don't like it, D'argo," she said with compassion, "but we need to go. Don't try to stop us."</p>
    <p>"But they shot you! How can you even consider about it?" D'argo wanted to take her by the shoulders and shake some sense into her, both of them. They were going to get themselves *and* their children killed.</p>
    <p>"Like that doesn't happen everyday," John muttered. "Earth is safer than the Uncharted Territories." He looked up. "Here we're hunted by the Peacekeepers, the Scarrans, bounty hunters, people I've never even heard of. There's always someone shooting at us no matter what we do..." John glanced at Aeryn and sighed. "We're tired of fighting, D'argo. I've been talking with Regie and I think we'll be able to make it work on Earth."</p>
    <p>"And the children?" D'argo challenged, not liking this argument. "Can you protect them from your own scientists?"</p>
    <p>"Better than we can protect them from a frag canon or spending two days starving in the access conduits," said Aeryn. "They shouldn't be growing up in a war zone."</p>
    <p>"They'll get killed!"</p>
    <p>"There's more of a chance they'll get killed on Moya!" John shouted. "How many close calls have they had already? It's only a matter of time until one of them gets seriously hurt or worse. We've lost too many -" he cut himself off and looked away. "We're going. I don't know if it's the right decision, but it's the one we've made, so just leave it, D'argo, please."</p>
    <p>The Luxan looked from one to the other. "So you're just going to abandon us? What about the refugees, Talyn's mission? The Scarrans and Peacekeepers are not going to stop simply because you run away!"</p>
    <p>"And what if they come to Earth, huh?" John glared at him. "They're close to unlocking wormholes D'argo, as close as Scorpy was. I can't leave Earth to face them alone."</p>
    <p>"So that's it. You're going." D'argo felt a weight in his stomach, his cold words turning his own insides to ice.</p>
    <p>"D'argo -" said Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"I don't want to hear it," he cut her off. He'd had enough of excuses, he thought angrily as he stormed out of their quarters.</p>
    <p>"Let him go," he heard John say quietly. Frell it! They'd made up their minds, and deep down he knew he couldn't stop them. John and Aeryn were capable of looking after themselves and wouldn't let a little thing like a Luxan warrior prevent them. They we're going to go down to Earth, and there was nothing he could frelling do about it.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>She wasn't sure what to make of the first plate. It wasn't anything extraordinary, just a plate of fried tubers. But it was sitting in the conduits that she now called home. Rhia had decided that the best way to avoid going to Earth was to hide in Moya's walls till her parents left without her. She'd counted on sleeping in the room next to Moya's starburst chamber, eating Rygel's food stashes, and avoiding everyone that would hunt her down like a criminal. She'd even thought up several booby traps to catch her enemies, but they didn't quite work the way they were supposed to.</p>
    <p>The problem was that no one was hunting her. She'd left the morning before after Mama and Dad had told her they were going to Earth, and so far her army of spies - Speckles and the boys - had reported the all clear. They didn't care that she was gone. And now there was a plate of hot tubers in the access conduit. What did it all mean?</p>
    <p>And then she realized. It was poison! A trick! They'd made a sleeping potion and sprinkled it on the tubers for her to eat. She'd fall asleep right there where they could grab her and lock her up before the torture started. Very clever, but Rhia was smarter.</p>
    <p>She took the plate and skittered away towards the starburst chamber. It was more difficult than usual since she only had one hand to climb the various ladders and inclines between her and her hideout. She finally decided to put the plate of tubers down her shirt, which was belted at the waist, because the more she thought about it, the less she thought you could poison tubers. Her hands now free, she made short work of crawling through the narrow tunnels, climbing down ladders, and ducking under ribs to her home in exile, The Dark Chamber.</p>
    <p>The Dark Chamber was a part of a secondary shaft whose ends had been sealed off to make a small room for the children to hide in when there was danger. If someone got this far in, Moya could start a starburst and keep them safe. Rhia knew the room well since it was also one of their play spots, but she only liked it when the door was open. If it was closed, then it meant the danger was for real.</p>
    <p>Rhia settled on the mat that served as her bed, kicking her thin blanket to one end. The tubers were still warm when she pulled them out of her shirt and before she could stop herself, she took a bite. They were much better than Rygel's food cubes. Munching happily, Rhia grabbed her coloring sticks and paper and, inspired by her unexpected meal, drew the center chamber with all her favorite foods on the table.</p>
    <p>Four solar days passed by and each day, Rhia found a plate of tubers at each mealtime in the tunnel near the center chamber. She knew who was giving them to her: it was Mama. She'd seen her set the plate out while the others were eating. But they never talked about her, no one did. Well good, Rhia told herself. She didn't *want* them to talk about her. But her words did little to fill the disappointment.</p>
    <p>As the arns dragged by, day after day, she felt more alone than ever. There was no one to tuck her in or wake her up in the mornings except Speckles, and as much as she loved her DRD, it wasn't the same. The games she normally played alone or with Seth and Essor felt different now that she couldn't go home afterward. Mama and Dad weren't there to read stories or sing or anything. She even missed grandpa Jack. In the Dark Chamber, Rhia spent countless hours coloring in the silence but she was getting tired of it. Part of her wanted to go home, but another part wouldn't let her lose the fight. They would have to beg and send her gifts and say they were sorry and wrong before she ever went back!</p>
    <p>Every day she came up with another victorious return. Mama and Dad would hug her and tell her that she would never have to go to Earth, that she could do whatever she wanted as long as she stayed with them. Everyone would congratulate her bravery through her suffering, and tell her how much they missed her, and they'd have a feast in her honor with all her favorite foods and no food cubes or tubers. Rhia would graciously forgive them, and everything would be all right again. That was the bedtime story that she clung to and that got her through the long days.</p>
    <p>And then came the note. It was a clear DRD sheet of plastic paper sitting neatly on her supper with her name on it in script. Slightly frightened by its unusual presence, Rhia looked out through the open panel into the center chamber but she didn't see anyone. Deciding to wait till she was safely back in the Dark Chamber, Rhia quickly returned. Out of breath, she stared at the note, not quite daring to read it yet. This was it. This was what she had been waiting for. They would apologize and tell her they couldn't stand her being away any longer.</p>
    <p>Almost joyfully, Rhia opened the note and read: "Rhia, We've run out of plates in the center chamber. Would you return the ones you have? Tomorrow I'll put out a change of clothes for you. Just leave the ones you're wearing in their place, and I'll wash them. Do you need anything else? Extra blankets, toys? Let me know. I love you, Mama."</p>
    <p>Rhia stared confusedly at the words that were not at all what she had expected. Mama didn't want her back, but she loved her anyway? She was *helping* her live away from home, but why? All her scenarios of a triumphant return crashed around her. Rhia just wanted to go home, she realized before bursting into tears.</p>
    <p>A quarter of an arn later, scrubbing her hands over her eyes so that she could see, she ascended back to quarters where everything was just as it had been before she'd left. She heard voices from her parents' room, which made her stop and almost run away again, but Speckles urged her on.</p>
    <p>"They've both been moping about like a couple of lost puppy dogs," she heard Dad say. "Pip says he's too controlling, but I think there's more to it than that."</p>
    <p>"She won't admit that she's in love with him. It scares the dren out of her because it's not just about the sex anymore," said Mama.</p>
    <p>Rhia cautiously looked around the open doorway. Mama and Dad were sitting next to each other on the bed, Mama cleaning her gun and Dad sewing up a hole in one of Seth's shirts. When Speckles whistled they both looked up.</p>
    <p>"Well, look who showed up," Mama smiled. "Everything all right? Do you need anything?" Feeling shy all of a sudden, Rhia shook her head. They didn't want her back. She'd run away, and now they didn't want her back! She could feel the tears sting her eyes. "Come here, baby." Mama held out her hand, and Rhia ran sobbing to her.</p>
    <p>"I wanna come home," she mumbled as her mother's strong arms picked her up and held her tight.</p>
    <p>"We missed you!" The soft words only made her cry harder.</p>
    <p>Rhia, exhausted, finally snuggled down between the two of them. Dad ran his hand over her hair, grinning. Feeling safe, the little girl closed her eyes.</p>
    <p>"She needs a bath," Dad said softly over her head. And for once Rhia didn't care.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Imbecile," Rygel muttered under his breath, but Regie didn't hear him.</p>
    <p>"Commander," the diplomat addressed John, "I realize the government is being a little restrictive about the divulgence of technology -"</p>
    <p>"Regie, they're talking monopoly. And there is no way in hell they're walkin' away with Park Place and Boardwalk."</p>
    <p>"There are national security concerns at stake," Regie countered. "We can't let the technology you're bringing us fall into the hands of terrorists."</p>
    <p>"I'm not working on a military base."</p>
    <p>"Ambassador Reginard," Rygel spoke up, "the United states government is only a partner in your international organization. Your own laws must prevent such intervention."</p>
    <p>"The US government is not proposing that you work counter to international law."</p>
    <p>"What? You want me to work just for you and snub IASA?" John sighed. Typical Black Suit thinking. It's what had kept the contract negotiations stalled for the past two and a half weekens. Waiting for replies or equally unacceptable terms was getting tiresome. "I've told you, I'm going to work for IASA in developing space and defense technology in case of an attack from space. The government's gonna have to go through them if they want a piece of the pie. Now can I talk to someone from IASA? This is going nowhere."</p>
    <p>"As a member of the First Contact Team, I represent IASA as well," said Reginard with a sigh.</p>
    <p>"Does IASA know that?"</p>
    <p>"Crichton, look," Reginard leaned toward the camera. "You don't like it, I don't like it, but this is what gets sent down to me from about fifteen different people who all want a piece of the pie, as you put it. You don't want to know how much bullshit I've already thrown in the wastebasket with reminders of you and your family's citizenship."</p>
    <p>John rubbed his eyes. "All right. You're doing your best," he said.</p>
    <p>"Now that we've said 'no'," Rygel continued, "will you be able to work out a separate deal between the US government and IASA that will satisfy Crichton and both parties?"</p>
    <p>"I'll see what I can do." Reginard glanced at his notes. "How 'bout we call it a day?" he asked, looking back up.</p>
    <p>John was more than happy to agree. With a tired see-you-tomorrow, he and Rygel signed off.</p>
    <p>"That went rather well," Rygel commented as they left command together. By mutual agreement they headed toward the center chamber for what was now becoming a ritual drink after talking with Earth.</p>
    <p>"If you say so, Sparky."</p>
    <p>"I do," was the self-assured reply. "We've reached the second stage of the negotiations. Now our demands will be listened to so that when we get to the third stage, we will get what we want."</p>
    <p>"There's a third stage to this little opera?"</p>
    <p>"You're feeble mind couldn't possibly understand," Rygel snorted dismissively. John rolled his eyes as they reached their destination. Napoleon always had to have the last word. With a twinge, he realized he was going to miss the annoying tyke.</p>
    <p>Dad was sitting at the table with a mug of hot tea in his hands when they came in. "Hey there," he greeted them, raising his mug slightly in salute. "How are the negotiations going?"</p>
    <p>"Excellent. Are there any dried tubers left?" asked Rygel heading straight for the fridge unit.</p>
    <p>John ran a hand through his hair. "Long," he told his father. He grabbed a mug of his own and joined the elder Crichton at the table. "The government basically wants me to sign a separate contract with them to give them exclusive rights to all the military data, but since that includes just about everything, IASA would be left with nothing."</p>
    <p>"And you don't trust the government to be in sole control," Jack finished. "I don't blame you."</p>
    <p>"Yeah. I'd probably disappear and never see the sunlight again."</p>
    <p>"John, it wouldn't be that bad," his Dad disagreed.</p>
    <p>John looked at him feeling the rift between them yawn once more. Dad had seemed to forgive John his murderous ways when he and Aeryn had decided to stay on Earth, but he still didn't understand the leap of faith they were taking. They were about to jump off a cliff without knowing if a sonic net was there to catch them.</p>
    <p>"What's wrong, son?"</p>
    <p>Something of what he was feeling must have shown on his face, he realized, and the concern he saw on his father's reminded him that he used to tell him everything, even after he'd been shot into the Uncharted Territories. "This move scares me, Dad," he said. "What if it's the wrong decision?"</p>
    <p>"It is," said Rygel through a mouthful of food.</p>
    <p>"Shut up, Buckwheat." John stared into eyes that once he thought he'd never see again. His father's eyes no longer seemed to be judging him but instead trying to understand.</p>
    <p>"Why do you think it might be the wrong decision?"</p>
    <p>"I'm scared the government will go after Aeryn and the kids. Medical experiments -"</p>
    <p>"Dissection," Rygel interrupted.</p>
    <p>John glared at the slug while Dad looked at him for an explanation. Here it goes again, he thought. "These aliens called the 'Ancients' took a walk through my brain and recreated Earth so they could see her reaction to an alien presence. We were locked up. Rygel was poisoned and dissected - well not really, but he was pretty pissed when he found out about it. I eventually figured it out but..."</p>
    <p>"It wasn't easy going back even if it wasn't real," Dad finished. "I had no idea."</p>
    <p>John shrugged. It was still difficult to talk about. The Ancients had really shaken his faith in the universe, Earth, himself even. It wasn't easy to look at what they did with his memories and say, 'See these people? These people are my people.'</p>
    <p>"Is that why you brought weapons down when you landed?" Dad asked.</p>
    <p>"One reason."</p>
    <p>"And the other?"</p>
    <p>John smiled, recognizing the old pattern of Q&amp;A Dad always used to get him to talk. The only thing now was that he was afraid the answers would put that hostile glint back in Dad's eye. "We don't go anywhere unarmed if we can help it."</p>
    <p>"Oh." Dad took a sip of his tea, but when he looked up again there was only sadness.</p>
    <p>Feeling the need to explain, John added, "If I have Winona I have a chance."</p>
    <p>"Winona?"</p>
    <p>"My gun."</p>
    <p>John held his eyes, refusing to back down. Finally, Dad nodded. "I understand," he said. "It's just hard seeing you so...different."</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry."</p>
    <p>"No, don't be sorry." Dad shook his head. "You have nothing to be sorry about. I've been...I'm an old man. I was just surprised."</p>
    <p>John laughed at the understatement of the cycle. Soon, Dad joined him, and it felt good.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Aeryn read over the final contract. They would work for IASA at the Kennedy Space Center with a team of scientists, made up of IASA and military personnel. Reginard was their liaison with the Government and Seymore the one with IASA. IASA would provide a house in a guarded neighborhood, the government extra security. The media was restricted to IASA press conferences and something called a 'restraining order' would be invoked if they were bothered elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Which would most likely be another attack, Aeryn thought cynically but quickly chastised herself. She remembered talking with Jack about it. He'd said the press would increase their internal security since it had been a disaster for their reputation, greatly reducing the risk of an attack from that angle, and that the press was actually a safety net to keep them from being secretly kidnapped. Aeryn would just have to trust that that was true. A frustrating thought.</p>
    <p>"It looks alright," she said glancing up from the hologram to where half of the crew was waiting for her approval.</p>
    <p>"Are you sure?" asked John across from her.</p>
    <p>Aeryn smiled for him. She was sure. This was their chance, the children's chance, at a better life. Yes, it might be dangerous, but then so was living on a leviathan in the middle of a war. She was willing to take the risk.</p>
    <p>"We leave in two days?" she confirmed. John nodded. Aeryn looked back at the contract, but this time her eyes didn't read the words. It had been a little more than a monen since they'd made the decision, not knowing if it would really happen or not. Now it was happening. In two days she would be on John's planet, peopled by billions of him. Well, maybe not *him*, she thought, looking fondly at her mate. A slow grin crept across his face.</p>
    <p>"So that's it then?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"That's it." A general shuffle rose as Aeryn, John, Rygel, D'argo, Chiana, and Emmerit got to their feet.</p>
    <p>"I just hope Rhia doesn't disappear again," Aeryn commented, switching off the chip recorder.</p>
    <p>John smiled, "One crisis at a time."</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>The move down to the planet was surprisingly hassle-free. IASA was serious about their promises and kept the press to a minimum while the pod landed with them and their meager belongings. John's old friend Giller conducted them to their new house, a statue of a man doing his unhappy duty very reluctantly. He still hadn't forgiven John for getting by his security with weapons and this time made a point of searching their bags. Disguised as toys, he missed them again.</p>
    <p>A crowd of family and close friends greeted them at the house to welcome them to Earth. In truth, John remembered it in a blur of faces, more concerned with reassuring Seth than anything else. There had been a lot of backslapping and the same conversation repeated at least fifty times.</p>
    <p>"Hey, John, how's it feel to be back?"</p>
    <p>"Good."</p>
    <p>"What's it like out there? What happened?"</p>
    <p>"It's different. I'll tell you about it later." Then he would move on.</p>
    <p>Now, two days later, it was hitting him: being back was strange. There was really no other way to describe it. Everything around John was familiar from a lifetime of use yet so completely odd at the same time. The first time he used the coffee machine he had nearly broken the damn thing. Nothing felt comfortable. Instead, he still felt like he was going to walk into the next room and see Pip and D chatting in front of the TV like one of his messed up fantasies. But they were on Moya, a universe away.</p>
    <p>John had thought he was ready to come back. After a month and a half of negotiating, convincing the kids, D'argo, and the rest that they weren't insane to do this, he'd thought it time. That the waiting and preparing would make it easier. He'd dreamed of showing Aeryn a thousand things about Earth: pizza, beer, the mall, his T-bird. But, of course, it wasn't that simple. Things had changed since he'd left. Not a lot, but little things like the fact that videotapes were considered dinosaur age. It left him feeling out of touch, which he was in a big way having been gone, and not as eager to find out what else was different. Everything around sparked memories of a past life that seemed like a dream, leaving him depressed by what he'd missed.</p>
    <p>And Christmas only made it worse. Overload would be putting it mildly. His whole family had descended on the Cape, but the phone calls and Christmas letters from old friends and strangers alike hadn't helped. This many people knowing where he lived made him decidedly nervous.</p>
    <p>When he'd seen the wreath on the door, John at first hadn't recognized it. He hadn't thought about Christmas much in the unending season of space. On Moya they had thrown a party a time or two to celebrate being alive and kicking, but they had been few and far between. Now, Christmas was here, and to John it felt...flat, like he was watching it through someone else's eyes. He should have been jumping for joy to be reunited with his family again, as they were, (well, most of them), but it wasn't that easy when everything just felt weird: doors with doorknobs, square rooms, harsh bright lights, and most disturbingly, the silence at night. It was a sound John associated with being not on Moya or Talyn - hostile territory or captured. Maybe that was why he felt on edge all the time, as if everyone were watching him.</p>
    <p>"So how's it feel to be back?" DK suddenly asked, startling John whose hand went immediately to his empty side. His old friend plopped down beside him on the couch and handed him a beer.</p>
    <p>"A bit strange," John answered. As casually as possible, he slid his hand back to a more natural position.</p>
    <p>DK didn't even notice. "Yeah, I'll bet. You'll be settled in in no time, though. Don't worry about it," DK grinned. "Happy to have Christmas again?"</p>
    <p>John shrugged, thoughts spinning. The kids at least were loving it, now that they had gotten used to all the strangers John called family. They had adjusted for the most part, more than he and Aeryn anyway. He had the grocery store to thank for that: Rhia had never seen so many different foods in one place before in her life. Extremely impressed, it was her favorite place to go now, and John had a sneaking suspicion that carrots and spaghetti would find their way into his stocking.</p>
    <p>"Oh, come on, you know you missed it," DK egged as he always had when he was trying to get John to admit something.</p>
    <p>"Okay," John gave in. "I missed the beer," he said, sending DK into a fit of laughter.</p>
    <p>"Good to know you've got your priorities straight," DK teased. "Don't worry," he leaned in to whisper, "I won't tell Aeryn."</p>
    <p>"Tell me what?" The two men turned quickly and saw Aeryn come in through the doorway behind the couch followed by Lisa with a bowl of red and green M&amp;M's.</p>
    <p>"Nothing," said DK innocently. It was the old pattern of covering in front of the girlfriend, or in this case the wife. Not that Aeryn would care, but DK seemed to be enjoying himself. John just flashed her a half smile that told her he would tell her later.</p>
    <p>"So John, how's it feel?" asked Lisa. "Good to be back in the groove?"</p>
    <p>"I'm doing okay," he said again. "Bit strange."</p>
    <p>"Better, I hope, than when you ended up out wherever you were?" Lisa grabbed a handful of M&amp;M's and sat back, grinning.</p>
    <p>"Managed to avoid killing anyone," John joked back, snatching a couple of green ones for himself. Beside him, DK stiffened, and the smile slipped briefly from his sister's face. Oh yeah, he had killed someone. Exchanging another look with Aeryn, John knew he was going to have to wipe that word from his vocabulary.</p>
    <p>"You killed someone when you first got out there?" DK demanded, quickly adding, "Sorry, I shouldn't have asked."</p>
    <p>"It was an accident." John looked away, memories of the day that had changed their lives forever flickering through his mind.</p>
    <p>"What about you, Aeryn? How do you like Earth?" Lisa quickly steered away from the touchy topic.</p>
    <p>"It's..." John could just see 'primitive' on the tip of her tongue, "pleasant."</p>
    <p>"Real different from what you're used to, huh?" Lisa smiled.</p>
    <p>"It explains a lot," Aeryn returned.</p>
    <p>The sound of tires on the driveway saved them from further interrogation. A moment later half a dozen car doors slammed shut and the gaggle of kids came in laden down by grocery bags with Melanie, Ryan, and Mark.</p>
    <p>"We better go give them a hand," Lisa stood up, the others following her example. By the time they reached the dining room, three kids - their two, and Melanie's four year old - were already storming out of the kitchen towards them.</p>
    <p>"Guess what, guess what!" Rhia shouted as she slammed into John's legs. "We met Santa Clause!" she rushed on before he had a chance to ask. Then in the garbled mix of languages she always fell into when she was excited, Rhia explained all about Santa Clause and his reindeer, Rudolph and the elves who made presents while John and Aeryn listened patiently, though Aeryn did throw a few amused glances his way. When she was done, Rhia took off with Seth and David, with barely a goodbye, to go upstairs and read 'The Night Before Christmas' which Ryan had bought for them.</p>
    <p>So Rhia was happy thanks to grocery stores and Santa Clause, John smiled as he grabbed one of the plastic bags to unpack. A light conversation picked up around him about the kids, but John paid it little attention, thinking instead of the change in them over the last couple of days from extremely shy carry-me-everywhere to their normal, half-wild selves. They were happy here, and that was what counted.</p>
    <p>John would get used to it here again, after all he had adjusted to the Uncharted Territories, hadn't he? Hopefully, Aeryn would hold up under the pressure too, but it was hard on her. Glancing up to the island where she was unpacking bags without putting anything away, he saw her neutral mask covering the exhaustion underneath. She still wasn't comfortable with the family all around them, often talking about old acquaintances and Earthy things that she didn't understand. Like him, she wasn't sleeping well, which didn't help matters any.</p>
    <p>"Excuse me, John." Melanie, startling him back to the present, gently pushed him out of her way to get at the cabinet he was standing in front of.</p>
    <p>"You know, you could have just asked me to put it away for you," he told her. Melanie gave him a look that clearly indicated that asking him for anything was out of the question. John sighed. He just wished that he could get her to talk to him and not have one of those double-edged conversations that were all he was getting now. But Melanie refused to crack.</p>
    <p>No, coming home was not easy at all. Between adjusting to all the familiar oddities, keeping Aeryn sane, the kids in line, and trying to live up to his family's Christmas wish that everything go back to normal, John just wanted to escape to Moya's hangar where he could lose himself in repairs. But he'd made his choice and Moya would be leaving soon to meet Talyn. There was no going back.</p>

    <p>Chapter 2: Hi Ho, Li Lo, It's Off to Work We Go</p>
    <p>*************************************************</p>
    <p>Landers stood as the Joint Chiefs filed into the conference room, shaking their hands before they settled around the table. "Gentlemen," he greeted them. The six military personal nodded in return over a general, low spoken "Mr. President." The mood was somber and deathly silent as Chairman Admiral Anthony Prior began his briefing by handing the President a folder.</p>
    <p>"As you know, the Diplomatic Enclave in Islamabad, Pakistan was attacked a second time four days ago. Thirty-four dead, twenty-eight wounded. It was a well-planned, concise attack consisting of two suicide bombers and rooftop covering fire. The information gathered by our intelligence units in the months preceding the attack was inconclusive leaving our forces in the dark as to the where, how, and when. However, recent reports indicate that if we move quickly we should be able to get a hold of at least the remaining cell members if not the network in the area." The former admiral of the Pacific Fleet nodded for his aides to dim the lights and then began the presentation.</p>
    <p>Landers listened to the plan his military advisors had cooked up over the last couple of days, asking a clarifying question here and there about their reasoning and tactics. It was complicated, but then most military operations these days had to strike a delicate balance between brute force and espionage to catch terrorists before they went underground. And it didn't help to have deal with a government that shook one hand with the world while it wiped away evidence with the other. Such was the Middle East these days.</p>
    <p>"What can we expect from our allies?" Landers asked when the bulk of the presentation was finished.</p>
    <p>"Since this was a terrorist attack, we will have at least verbal support form our allies. Whether they will do more than they have in the past is another question given the political climate," Admiral Prior replied.</p>
    <p>Landers didn't have to ask for clarification of what that meant. Even before the first Embassy attack last summer, the situation had been going downhill, snowballing in just the last month with another bloody conflict in Kashmir breaking out. Secretary Clermont already had his hands full of that situation and now with this second attack, things were only going to get worse.</p>
    <p>That thought led him to his next troubled question. "Why was our intelligence inconclusive?"</p>
    <p>"As our technology gets better, so does theirs," said Prior. "Encryption codes, double language codes, new methods of transferring information...Our intelligence people are doing their best."</p>
    <p>"Well, you're best just got thirty-four people killed!" Landers snapped, patience breaking. With a sigh, he paused to get a grip on his temper. "Excuse me, Admiral."</p>
    <p>"Of course, Mr. President. It's been frustrating for us all," Prior murmured graciously but with a steel in his voice that Landers knew was aimed not at him, but at the terrorists who had murdered thirty-four service men and relief workers in a United States Embassy.</p>
    <p>When would it stop, the endless fighting and the hate? They had been waging this war on terror for too long with too few victories. Landers knew there were no easy answers. At this point, drastic measures seemed like the only solution.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Jack sighed in contentment as he settled before the glowing fire with a mug of coffee. Stomach full, surrounded by his whole family, it was good to say that Christmas had been a success. Smiling, he remembered the look of astonishment on Rhia and Seth's faces when they had seen the tree lit up, full stockings in front of the chimney, and more presents than there had been the night before. Their first Christmas had been filled with candy, clothes, and toys of which a few, like the stuffed animals, had been met with puzzlement since they of course hadn't known what they represented.</p>
    <p>John and Aeryn had also enjoyed themselves, receiving clothes from the girls to supplement their few Earth outfits, and a fishing rod and tackle from him. When John had opened DK's gag gift of underwear, he'd grinned and passed the package to Aeryn who'd simply glared at him until he'd added it to the growing pile of clothes, books, and CDs.</p>
    <p>All in all, things were going well, he thought. John had joked and horsed around in front of the TV with DK, Mark, and Ryan, fully approving of his little sister's choice in husbands while they made a general nuisance of themselves. Lisa and Melanie had been everywhere: cooking dinner and making sure the festivities kept under control, while Aeryn took the kid watch and kept them from breaking their toys on the first day. She was a natural with them; one look was all it took to calm them down a little while they played - two parts fear from her nephews but utter respect from her own children who kept pulling her into their games like a familiar playmate, which Jack soon saw she was.</p>
    <p>"Hey, Dad." Jack glanced up in surprise when Melanie sat down tiredly beside him. He thought everyone else had gone to bed.</p>
    <p>"Hey, kiddo. How're you holding up?" he asked.</p>
    <p>Mel scrubbed her face. "Tired," she said through a yawn. "But okay, I guess."</p>
    <p>"Well, you and Lise sure knocked yourselves out on that dinner. It was wonderful."</p>
    <p>"Oh, it was nothing special," Melanie said modestly.</p>
    <p>"No really, compared with how you used to cook?" Jack teased.</p>
    <p>Grinning, Melanie replied, "Aeryn seemed to think it was pretty strange."</p>
    <p>Jack chuckled, glowing from the inside out at this rare conversation with his youngest daughter. They had never been close, and since John had 'died,' it had only gotten worse. But here they were. Talking like they had used to. Amazing. "She did eat it, though," he pointed out.</p>
    <p>"Yeah." Melanie looked down at her hands, and Jack took another sip of his coffee, hoping she would tell him what was on her mind. "I don't know if I like her," she finally said. "Aeryn, I mean."</p>
    <p>"Really? Why not?"</p>
    <p>"Her and John...I hated him for leaving. I think I hate him even more for coming back, especially since he and Aeryn are so..."</p>
    <p>"Married?"</p>
    <p>"Married. Happy together. Part of me wants him to suffer like we did. But having him home... I don't know."</p>
    <p>Jack took another sip of coffee, thinking about his son. On Moya he had been so different, dark. The clothes, the gun - *Winona*, he reminded himself. "*If I have Winona I have a chance - A choice between me or them, I'm gonna make sure it's them.*" Again he wondered what had happened out there. John hadn't said much, the stories he did tell kept them laughing and didn't explain why he felt the need to carry a gun, *name* his gun.</p>
    <p>"I know it's hard 'cause he was gone for so long, but he did want to come back to be with us," Jack said. "I think more happened out there than he lets on, and I don't think all of it was nice."</p>
    <p>"Yeah. I just wish he would at least talk about it, you know? Not go on as if we grieved for nothing. If anyone even mentions it, all he does is look at Aeryn and change the subject. I feel like I'm missing something he says."</p>
    <p>Jack hadn't noticed, but then he'd simply been happy to have John home and hadn't looked any further. "Maybe you should talk to him." Melanie snorted at the idea. "Well, you're talking to me, so we know miracles can happen."</p>
    <p>She looked over at him with the same exasperated expression Leslie used to give him when he said something not even worthy of a comment. After a moment, however, it softened, as if Mel had just realized that she was actually having a heart to heart with her old man. "I'll think about it." She stood and headed for the stairs and her waiting bed. "Night." It was more than Jack had hoped for from her. Another Christmas miracle.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Glancing at the clock on the wall, Reginard cursed. He was going to be late, he just knew it. He hated January! All the paperwork that went on Christmas vacation came back like the Ghost of Christmas Past to haunt him - or maybe it was God's way of punishing the government and the bureaucrats who wrapped everyone else up in paperwork for the rest of the year. Whatever the reason, Reginard had paperwork, and lots of it, that had to be done if he didn't want Clermont breathing down his neck, before the Welcome ceremony at one o'clock.</p>
    <p>With a sigh, Reginard got down to prioritizing, making a note to find a new secretary who could do this for him. The young lady he had now was too scared to screw up and thus gave him everything, even after he had told her at least a dozen times that he did not want every single security report. There had to be a good ten in the stack - all mixed in, of course, so he couldn't just grab the lot and throw them out the window. Clamping down on his frustration, Reginard took a deep breath and tried to calm down.</p>
    <p>Security report, security report, FCC memo, FCC diner invitation, he leafed through the pile. Security report, report status requests from DC - State Department, Defense Department, and the White House - security report, threatening letter, IASA water bill - how the hell did that get into his in basket? Great, now they were trying to give him paperwork that wasn't even his. Security report, investigation report - he stopped, pulling it out. Now that was something he'd willingly read.</p>
    <p>With a grim smile, he opened the envelope from the Canaveral FBI Bureau, hoping they'd made progress in tracking down the money used to bribe the National Guardsman when Crichton had come to visit back in October. The report his buddy Stanley sent him wasn't very promising. Talking with Private Chase's comrades had loosened up the fact that he'd been bribed and a few names to check out, but so far nothing new. The only lead they had now was a printed letter with pickup instructions for the other half of the money. The date had come and gone with a no show, but they still had the call sign of the sender, 'Piece of Cod', which they were translating to mean 'Peace of God', (only took them a week to figure that one out, he recalled sarcastically.)</p>
    <p>The only problem with that lead was the number of religious groups who were against Crichton and the aliens, the number of factions within them, and the easy likelihood of someone using them to cover his ass. As he read the report, and more importantly, between the lines, Reginard knew they were still working on it. It would be a long haul.</p>
    <p>He filed the report in the cabinet by his desk, then stacked up his now prioritized inbox, the security reports on the bottom. If he didn't get to them, well gee-darn, guess his secretary would have to get them sorted out during lunch. The morning passed in a boring rush of his own reports to Washington, IASA, and the FCC, getting everything neat and in order before Crichton and Sun came to work that afternoon.</p>
    <p>Sure enough, he didn't have time to start the security reports by the time 12:45 rolled around. With an apologetic smile, he handed them to his secretary on his way to the main building, with instructions that they be summarized and annotated with names and telephone numbers by the time he got back. Which he didn't tell her.</p>
    <p>The media was all set up when he arrived. Bypassing them, Reginard headed for the conference room where Jeremy and Michel were probably already waiting for him. His watch told him he had five minutes before he had to go shake hands and listen to another of Oursler's 'Great Step for Humanity' speeches. Mentally he reviewed his checklist for the afternoon: keep Crichton happy and safe, keep him and Giller away from each other, keep him and Oursler away from each other as much as possible, make sure the scientists got to mingle before they exploded from the excitement, keep the press happy, make sure Scott didn't speak at all... that about covered it.</p>
    <p>"Hi, Thomas," Jeremy greeted him cheerfully when he entered the conference room. "You spilt coffee on your shirt." Reginard looked down. Just when he thought his day couldn't get any worse. There it was: a nice, light brown stain. Mocking him.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Today's ceremony marks the beginning of another stage in Man's quest to discover the stars," Shannon reported. "Commander John Crichton was welcomed back into the fold of IASA where he will lead his former colleagues on a new journey. IASA has created a special project team composed of IASA and military personnel to study, learn, and adapt the alien technology to Earth's needs. IASA spokesman, Peter Feilly said that the possibilities are endless: from faster than light space travel to new medical procedures to new defenses against terrorism. The technology will be shared among the IASA member nations."</p>
    <p>"How have Commander Crichton and his alien companion reacted to their second welcome on Earth?" asked Debra from the anchor desk, fifty miles away.</p>
    <p>"Since they arrived on Earth three weeks ago, they have been sequestered from the public eye while they spent Christmas with the Crichton family. At their first public appearance today, they appeared calm and unworried about an attack. Ambassador Thomas Reginard said in a statement yesterday that both security and employee screening has been stepped up."</p>
    <p>"How great is the threat of a second assassination attempt?"</p>
    <p>"Well, Debra, since the first incident there has been an overwhelming condemnation of the attack because of its terrorist tactics and threat to American civilians. There are still voices of protest, but IASA and government security measures have kept overt action to a minimum."</p>
    <p>"Thank you, Shannon. This is Debra Wilkins, and we'll be right back."</p>
    <p>Shannon expelled a satisfied breath once Debra signed off. Pulling out the earpiece, she accepted the water bottle Henry handed her and took a long drink. "Nothing like a story to make your throat dry."</p>
    <p>"Finally," muttered David as he packed up the equipment. They'd all been pretty put out by the security blockade around Crichton. They'd tried getting into the neighborhood but the single gate was unbribable and they didn't want to push their luck while the rumored Secret Service was living in the house across the street.</p>
    <p>"Come on," said Shannon briskly. "The next press conference is in an hour and I want to get good seats."</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Dan honestly tried, but he couldn't keep the happy grin off his face. His friend and colleague Kiwi Taylor looked at him as a parent would an excited child. John had arrived with his alien, Oursler's speeches were over, the press's questions answered, and now... now work would begin! And Daniel Henry Bemear was the senior engineer on Crichton's team!</p>
    <p>While Dan had never been a close friend of John's, he had known him fairly well from working together on various projects, including the latter stages of the first Farscape Project. They'd gotten along together, and Dan couldn't wait to get down to the nuts and bolts of the alien technology. Not to mention the fact that he was going to be working with a real live alien woman! It was a moment to savor.</p>
    <p>"Commander Crichton, Ms. Sun, the research team you'll be working with headed by Dr. Bemear. I think you already know each other," Jeremy introduced them. Dan eagerly shook hands with the two of them.</p>
    <p>"Dan, nice to see you again," said John.</p>
    <p>"It's a pleasure to meet you," Ms. Sun greeted him in slightly accented English.</p>
    <p>"The pleasure is mine," Dan replied, managing not to garble the words. "Let me introduce you to the team." Taking over from Jeremy, he eagerly led them into the room where the other eight scientists were waiting. Part of him still couldn't believe this was finally happening. "First from IASA, Dr. Peter Howard and Dr. Maria Pellam whom I believe you met on Moya." The two engineers shook their hands, and Dan went on. "Shuttle Pilot Kiwi Taylor -"</p>
    <p>"Kiwi?" John asked, surprised by the odd name.</p>
    <p>The pilot chuckled. "From New Zealand. We're called Kiwis because of the native bird. When I moved here it just stuck," she said, her Down Under island accent strong. Dan smiled with vicarious pride; she loved talking about her country.</p>
    <p>"And Commander Jason Klee, also from the astronaut corps," he continued. "He was on the Space Station when Moya arrived for the first time."</p>
    <p>"Nice to see you made it home in one piece, Commander," said Klee as he heartily shook John's hand.</p>
    <p>"Thank you, Commander," John answered with a smile.</p>
    <p>Moving on, Dan introduced the military contingent, a good group of people in his opinion. He and Jeremy had worked hard to pick an open, non-threatening group. "Major Dell Fanby, Army Combat Engineers; Captains George O'Reilly and Simon Worthel, Air Force Space Command; Captain Diana Lerner, Naval Intelligence."</p>
    <p>"Nice to meet y'all," said John after all the introductions were finished. "I don't have a speech or anything, so why don't we get straight to the punch." The suggestion was met with smiles and the scratch of chairs as the new team settled around the large table. "We brought a bunch of stuff from Moya with us: blueprints, my module, worn out spare parts for us to work with, plus all the notes I've made over the years for some of the stuff I've seen. That should get us started with the basic systems for the hetch and we'll go from there."</p>
    <p>"John," Dan spoke up, "can you give us an idea of what specifically we are going to work on?"</p>
    <p>"Power and fuel sources for starters," the astronaut told him. "Expanded laws of physics and dimensions you'll need for just about everything. Hetch, planetary warning and defense systems, and some other cool toys," John shrugged and looked at Ms. Sun to see if she had anything to add.</p>
    <p>"You're the tech," she said.</p>
    <p>"Right. And you're *just* the mechanic," he returned, his tone making it clear they were bantering over a long-standing joke, and Dan smiled with the rest of his team. It looked like they would have a good working atmosphere. This was so exciting! He resisted the urge to start laughing.</p>
    <p>"Any questions before we get started?" John asked.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Captain Worthel raised a finger. "What can you tell us about how you reached the other galaxy? At Peterson, we recorded the radiation wave that struck your module at the time of the Slingshot Maneuver. It's never been proved, but since your recent return, we've been throwing around the wormhole idea, that you somehow opened a gate, if you will, between our solar system and where you landed. What are your thoughts?"</p>
    <p>John stared at him a second before answering, "that's the theory I came up with but never proved either."</p>
    <p>"Even with all the advanced technology available?" Worthel asked, surprised.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, we kinda had other things on our minds at the time," John answered, shifting slightly in his seat.</p>
    <p>"So you think that's what happened?" Captain O'Reilly jumped in excitedly.</p>
    <p>"You know," said Maria, "we could probably get wormholes on the agenda as -"</p>
    <p>"Could we not talk about wormholes?" John suddenly interrupted, his voice suddenly harsh with a glare to match.</p>
    <p>"But -"</p>
    <p>"Wormholes bring nothing but destruction," Aeryn said quietly, her gaze sliding over every member of the team. When it landed on him, Dan couldn't help but look away from the sad sincerity that lurked just beneath the surface. "They're not worth the pain they cause."</p>
    <p>"Anything else?" asked John, briskly. It was apparently not a subject he wanted to dwell on. Surprised by the change in attitude, Dan wondered what Ms. Sun had meant. Why would wormholes cause pain? They were only for transportation.</p>
    <p>"You said you modified the Farscape with hetch technology?" Dan asked to get them back on safer ground. "How did you merge the two technologies? Will we be going into that?"</p>
    <p>John nodded. "Yeah. I'll show what I've done. Help you get an idea of what you're getting into. You wanna see her now?" Dan couldn't stop the grin. John stood up, Ms. Sun following his example. Dan and the rest of the team needed no further invitation.</p>
    <p>Dan led them out of the building to one of the research hangars nearby where John swiped his card and entered a code that let them into the building. Inside, Dan felt his mouth slide open in awed shock. The Farscape I. It was like coming face to face with a holy relic. The expectation and the actual sight were once again at odds with each other. The sleek vessel was still mostly white with many black burns streaking its sides. Under one such mark, he could just make out the American flag and IASA logo, still there after all this time like an echo to the past. Dan felt a shiver go up his spine. This was it! This was real! This ship had taken John to another galaxy! He barely dared breath.</p>
    <p>And then he noticed the unfamiliar: gold fins on each side of the craft that had to be part of the hetch drive. He was looking at a ship that could go faster than the speed of light!</p>
    <p>"Wow," breathed Jason. "She's beautiful." From the matching expressions of reverence on the others' faces, Dan knew that for each in his or her own way, this was a religious experience, even for the military personnel. Wormholes utterly forgotten, the team advanced slowly and listened carefully as Crichton and Sun began to explain.</p>
    <p>********************</p>
    <p>Chapter 3: Twister</p>
    <p>********************</p>
    <p>This was the story of her life, Chiana thought bitterly as she looked sideways down the table. She had something perfect, too perfect by her standards, so she frelled it up, cut and run, biting before she was bit. It had been almost three monens since she had told Medri to never come near her again, one they had spent in orbit around Earth, the other two on the journey back to the familiar parts of the Uncharted Territories. They were talking again, if one called short monosyllabic conversations talking, that is. She had almost tried apologizing and actually got as far as "I'm" before he had cut her off with a terse "forget it."</p>
    <p>Sighing, Chiana picked at her food. A new supply, thankfully, but she still didn't know what it was. The conversation she had had with John before he and Aeryn had left floated to her mind like a haunting ghost, words stinging just as freshly if they had just been said. "Well, little girl, you really screwed the pooch this time," he'd told her. She remembered the way she had avoided his eyes as he had sat down beside her. "You can't keep kicking 'em in the balls just because you're scared."</p>
    <p>"He deserved it," she'd muttered defiantly.</p>
    <p>"Because you provoked him into a rage by flirting. If you want him back, you're going to have to make the first move. No other way to clean up this mess. And I think you want him back."</p>
    <p>Damn him for knowing her so well, she cursed silently. At the other end of the table, Medri was stubbornly not looking in her direction. Was she *in* love with him? How did you know when you were in love? True, they'd been frelling each other for over two cycles now, but she'd done that before with friends and enemies alike. But how did she know it was *love*? Something to commit to, like John and Aeryn finally had, as D'argo had wanted to all those cycles ago? What if it didn't work?</p>
    <p>That was the question that terrified her, the one she didn't want to look in the face. Now, she'd never find out, she thought bitterly. "When you completely frell up, you're the only one who can fix it," Aeryn's words came back to her suddenly. She should know, Chiana thought. She remembered giving the ex-peacekeeper advice, but it was suddenly so much harder now that she was to one who had to take it.</p>
    <p>"Fix it." The Nebari took a deep breath to steady herself. Medri was still engrossed in his conversation with Fil about the best course to take to the rendezvous with Talyn. Standing, Chiana walked over to them.</p>
    <p>"Hey," she said, so nervous that she felt her knees tremble. The spotted man looked up carefully, and Filalla muttered something about relieving Emmerit on watch and left.</p>
    <p>"What do you want?" Medri asked, turning back to his plate.</p>
    <p>"I just...uh...just..." her mind blanked out.</p>
    <p>"What? No one else around to frell?" he snapped, impatiently this time. Chiana stepped back, stung, ready to do battle, but she managed to swallow down the angry retort.</p>
    <p>"I wanted to, uh...apologize. I'm sorry." There. It was done, but her boots still quaked.</p>
    <p>"For what?"</p>
    <p>'For what!?' Was he being deliberately stupid? Chiana felt her temper flare. *He* was the one that had started accusing her! Why the frell had she thought she could solve anything by apologizing? "Because you provoked him into a rage by flirting," John's unforgiving voice echoed in the back of her mind.</p>
    <p>Unable to stand any longer, Chiana sat down in Filalla's place across from Medri. He glared at her but didn't say anything. It gave her hope that he hadn't walked out on her yet. "I'm sorry for, you know...the Human."</p>
    <p>He stared at her. "Yeah," he finally said. Chiana didn't know what else to say. What was she supposed to do now?</p>
    <p>After another awkward moment of not looking at each other, she repeated, "yeah," and stood to go. So much for fixing things, she thought crossly.</p>
    <p>But when she reached the door, Medri called out. "How's Essor?" A strange question since he'd seen him, of course. The ship was too small for him not to have, and Essor went everywhere he pleased anyway.</p>
    <p>"He's good," she told him, feeling suddenly on safer ground. "You can...you can come see him. If you want."</p>
    <p>"Okay."</p>
    <p>"Okay."</p>
    <p>Medri looked back at his plate, pushing the remaining food around with his fork. He didn't look back up, so Chiana left. It wasn't till she was back in her quarters that she started to breath normally again.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Looking around the cafeteria, Aeryn didn't see anyone that she knew. She normally ate with John or the research team but the former was meeting with Reginard, and the latter was finishing up the notes from the last session. Feeling tired of being left out and mostly ignored, she had decided to go eat, but heading to an empty table with her tray only made her feel worse.</p>
    <p>She had been working at IASA with John for over a monen now - it was February 2011 - and things hadn't gotten better. True, they weren't fighting for their lives every other day, they had food, and the kids were happy, but it wasn't anything like she had expected. She was still an outsider, an exposition they came up to so that they could say, "I talked to the alien."</p>
    <p>Around the room, she could feel their eyes on her like weights, waiting for any mistake. There were a few whispers here and there from those who resented her presence, a tentative smile from those who didn't. So far, nothing had happened - nothing overt anyway. An anonymous phone call, typed notes, stares and whispers, it wasn't anything she couldn't handle.</p>
    <p>Sitting down, she supposed it wasn't all bad. She liked John's family for the most part, and her colleagues did try to start conversations with her. The problem was there wasn't much to talk about really. The "What's your planet like?" line died when she told them she grew up on a ship. She'd talked a little about being a pilot with the military contingent, but that conversation had been cut short by work and hadn't come up again.</p>
    <p>"Hey, there you are," Dan came up behind her and sat down. Kiwi Taylor, Captain Worthel, and Major Fanby joined them across the table with a clatter of trays. "You ran out of there in a hurry. Feeling all right?" Dan asked, concerned.</p>
    <p>Aeryn nodded, swallowing the last of her resentment. "Fine."</p>
    <p>"You sure? You seem a little down," said Kiwi, a small frown marring her forehead.</p>
    <p>She shrugged. "I wasn't being much help." No help at all, she added silently. She could do the tech work: fix the prowler, Moya, the pods, even John's module if she had to, but talking about adapting it to Earth's existing technology that she knew next to nothing about, without something concrete to look at, was next to impossible.</p>
    <p>"But you're a great help," Kiwi contradicted her. "We wouldn't understand any of this without you." Aeryn gave her a look that asked whether she was out of her mind. "Who else could have taught us your technology?" the New Zealander challenged.</p>
    <p>"John," she answered. It had been easier in the beginning when they were simply teaching the basics that didn't involve finding ways to make Earth equipment better. Aeryn simply felt...useless, and she hated it.</p>
    <p>"You know what you need?" Fanby told her. "You need to get out an do something fun this weekend. What have you been doing for fun since you've been here?" he asked.</p>
    <p>Startled by the question, Aeryn thought back over the last few weeks. She and John had been working pretty hard, spending most of their free time with Rhia and Seth. Once they had gone out to dinner, but the press had shown up and they'd cut the night short. After that, neither of them had had the urge to go out much. The park with the kids, a football game that Aeryn would never understand. Family and friends had come by, wanting to show them everything about the area, but it was hard to sneak out without an audience, despite the contract promising them privacy.</p>
    <p>"What do you like to do? What did you do on Moya in your free time?" Fanby pressed when she didn't answer right away.</p>
    <p>"Play with my children," Aeryn answered.</p>
    <p>"That's right. I keep forgetting you and John are married," Captain Worthel nodded.</p>
    <p>Fanby smiled. "And to get away from your kids?"</p>
    <p>"Work," Aeryn smiled, knowing he wouldn't be satisfied. "What do I do in my spare time - when I'm not with Rhia and Seth?" She nodded once to him to make sure she had the question right, and he grinned back. She looked over his head, thinking. "Work out, train. On Moya I'd clean my weapons and make sure my ship was functional -"</p>
    <p>"Your ship? Moya?" Dan interrupted curiously.</p>
    <p>"My Prowler," Aeryn shook her head. "One person fighter craft."</p>
    <p>"You said you were a pilot, but you never said you had your own ship. How come you never told us?" Kiwi said, accusingly. From the look on her face, she was both put out and slightly jealous.</p>
    <p>Aeryn shrugged. It hadn't seemed important at the time. And technically speaking it wasn't *hers*.</p>
    <p>"You flew in your military?" Dan asked, having not been a part of the earlier conversation.</p>
    <p>"The Peacekeepers, yes."</p>
    <p>"The Peacekeepers? But that's not Moya," Captain Worthel jumped on the new detail.</p>
    <p>"No. I was kicked out shortly after I met John. My captain declared me Irreversibly Contaminated by an unknown alien life form. John forced D'argo to take me with them on Moya, and I've been running with them ever since. We used my first Prowler to escape," she explained. She doubted they understood, but at least it was a topic of conversation that she could deal with.</p>
    <p>"So you left, just like that," said Fanby. "Your career gone in an instant. You didn't go to trial, or appeal or anything?"</p>
    <p>"There was nothing to appeal. My captain declared me Contaminated. I faced execution. The only thing I could do was run."</p>
    <p>"And you actually *joined* that kind of military?" Kiwi asked, incredulous. Her forkful of food lowered in surprise.</p>
    <p>"I was born into it." The sudden stares made Aeryn uncomfortable. Maybe she shouldn't have said anything after all. The Humans all looked at each other.</p>
    <p>"That's -"</p>
    <p>"Scary," Dan finished Fanby's sentence. "And dangerous."</p>
    <p>"Are they one of the reasons we're learning about defense systems?" asked Worthel to which Aeryn nodded. "Nice."</p>
    <p>"Look, there she is!" a voice across the room broke the silence the small group had fallen into. Aeryn turned and saw two of the Farscape project engineers, Jeff Leacore and Conrad Murphy, rushing over to their table. "Ms. Sun," Jeff called out as they approached. "Glad we found you. We've been running over the old data from when John disappeared, trying to fit it with our wormhole theory and we were wondering -"</p>
    <p>A jolt like ice stabbed through the ex peacekeeper. "Don't," she interrupted. Wormholes. It always came back to wormholes. Sudden images of torture, death, pain, screams of suffering, the faces of those who'd died because of wormholes, the ones she'd killed to prevent them. The Humans would open a door they wouldn't be able to close, and it would cost them their existence.</p>
    <p>"Pardon me?" said Jeff, confused.</p>
    <p>"Don't try to find wormholes," said Aeryn, standing suddenly to face him. "It will get you all killed. Excuse me. I have to find John." Find John so they could stop the research. She strode away, cold determination taking over as she left the table of confused and worried scientists.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Rhia was bouncing in her seat. She was so excited. She was in Grandpa's car with Seth, and they'd snuck out of the neighborhood without anyone seeing them! They were in disguise. Rhia wore a green cape and hat, and Seth had a jacket and glasses with a nose and mustache attached. Then they'd crouched down in the back seat and Grandpa had driven away.</p>
    <p>They were going to the zoo! Where they had *animals* that you didn't eat, just watched. She remembered Christmas when she hadn't known any of the stuffed animals, and Grandpa had promised then to take them to the zoo, and they were going. Rhia couldn't wait.</p>
    <p>The drive was kinda long, but finally they arrived and pulled into the big parking lot. It was mostly empty; Grandpa said it was because it was a winter school day, but there were still a handful of cars near the entrance. Once they were parked and Grandpa paid, they went in.</p>
    <p>Rhia thought she had stepped into yet another world. Right in front was a shallow pool with pink creatures walking around on stick like legs. "Those are flamingoes," said Grandpa. Rhia had never seen anything like them! And that was only the beginning. They saw everything: the seals and fish in the pools, fierce alligators, colorful birds, the big cats, the bears, the snakes...everything. And it was all wonderful!</p>
    <p>Her favorite though were the monkeys on their island with ropes and swings that they used to get around. "Look, look at them!" she shouted excitedly while they watched the small primates from the rail. "They're fighting over the food!" Two of the monkeys chattered angrily at each other, each one holding onto the end of a banana. Finally, the banana broke in two and they each leaped away, chattering and throwing angry looks at one another. "Look! Look!" she pointed to make sure Grandpa saw.</p>
    <p>"I see," he said.</p>
    <p>If Rhia could be any animal, she wanted to be a monkey because they could move by swinging from rope to rope. It looked so much better than walking!</p>
    <p>They spent the most time with the monkeys, but eventually moved on to the elephants and giraffes, which were huge and gentle. They even got to feed them! The elephant had a long nose called a trunk that reached out to take the grass she held. She felt the papery skin brush her hand and giggled.</p>
    <p>Rhia didn't notice the time go by, though her feet did start to hurt after lunch. She wished Grandpa would carry her and not Seth, but she didn't complain because he was little. Instead, they stopped more often to rest and ended up going back to the monkey island till the zoo closed.</p>
    <p>In the car on the way home, Rhia dreamed of swinging with them on the island.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>John read the report calmly, the words registering on an objective level in his brain. Across from him, Regie waited quietly for him to look up. When he did, the diplomat's eyes studied him for a reaction.</p>
    <p>"So they think it's these 'In Jesus Name' people, with a little help from Washington, who shot at us on the runway?" he verified. Regie nodded. God, John hated religion! Caused nothing but trouble. He hadn't noticed it much before, but then, he hadn't been the Devil incarnate before either.</p>
    <p>"I know a guy up in Washington who's doing a little nosing around on his own," said Regie. "He'll let me know if he finds anything."</p>
    <p>"Let you know before or after they cover it up?" John retorted.</p>
    <p>"Landers isn't Nixon, John. He wants answers too."</p>
    <p>"Who?"</p>
    <p>"Landers?" Regie's eyebrows shot up at the question.</p>
    <p>"No, the other one. Nixon?" John had never heard the name before, and judging from the way Regie was staring at him, he should have.</p>
    <p>"You don't know who he is? President Richard Nixon? Watergate? Early '70's?"</p>
    <p>Okay, thanks for making me feel like an idiot, thought John embarrassed. Another thing different and gone from his memory. He remembered the 1970's but no Nixon. "Forget it," he waved a dismissive hand. With the number of people who'd been through his head... "You said you wanted to see me about something else?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah." Regie still looked unsure of him - the loony-bin look, John thought annoyed - but nevertheless went on to the next item. "Washington is concerned about the progress you're making with your technology team."</p>
    <p>"Concerned about my progress," John repeated, not liking the sound of that.</p>
    <p>"They want to know how far you've come on new hybrid communication and defense systems, and want someone from your team to send them biweekly progress and assessment reports."</p>
    <p>"Who's 'they'? And what do they expect after a month?"</p>
    <p>Regie ignored his questions and went on. "Jeremy also asked me to pass this on to you," he handed John a sheet of paper. "It's from the University of Virginia asking for DNA samples from you and your family."</p>
    <p>Scanning over the formal letter, John felt sick. "The answer's 'no'. I gave at the door." Regie nodded with little surprise and handed him another sheet of paper and a pen. It was a formal refusal just waiting for his signature.</p>
    <p>Once done, John asked, "And the government? They don't want a piece of me yet?"</p>
    <p>"Presidential orders. You're more valuable for the technology than your blood at this point, and Landers prefers to work with positive reinforcement." Regie smiled humorlessly. "Better for his image."</p>
    <p>So the docs were all just waiting in line for the word from the top. Great. "As long as I give him better weapons and defenses, me and my family are safe."</p>
    <p>"If you don't like it, why did you come back?"</p>
    <p>Why? John didn't know anymore. He'd known this would happen, known for cycles what kind of welcome awaited him. But he and Aeryn had still come to get the kids away from the war, to tell his family he was alive, to give Earth a fighting chance against the Peacekeepers and Scarrans. "'Cause what's out there is worse," he sighed. And deep down he wanted it to work on Earth, needed it to. "So what's the big arms race on for anyway?" John asked, getting back on topic.</p>
    <p>"Have you turned on the news lately?" Regie asked back, tone bordering on sarcastic.</p>
    <p>Right, thought John. Terrorists. Speaking of... "Have you talked to Giller yet about tightening security at the house? More reporters are slipping through the woods like it's the Mexican border."</p>
    <p>"He tells me he's on it."</p>
    <p>Uh, huh. Sure. "Well, tell him, if he doesn't do something by tomorrow, I'll take care of it myself." John had had about enough of the sleaze balls snooping around. They'd been lucky so far that nothing had happened, but it was only a matter of time.</p>
    <p>"John, don't do anything stupid," the Ambassador cautioned him. "You do not want to antagonize him."</p>
    <p>"Too late."</p>
    <p>"I'm serious! He'll cause trouble for you."</p>
    <p>John looked at Regie, not saying anything for a minute. The other man was worried for him. It was no secret that he and Giller had never gotten along. "I don't advise that he mess with me either," John said, standing to go.</p>
    <p>"Just be careful." Regie stood as well and shook his hand before he left. John nodded, thankful for his concern. If things kept up in this direction, he'd need a friend on the inside.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Filalla! Run!" D'argo jumped up and started firing over the crates that protected him from the Peacekeepers on the other side. He counted a good dozen scattered throughout the indoor market before dropping back behind his shelter. He could hear the locals screaming amongst the pulse fire. He didn't know where the others were, didn't know if Fil and Chiana had gotten away before the Peacekeepers had spotted them. Emmerit was around somewhere, hopefully tucked behind a wall more solid than D'argo's crate. He could smell it starting to smolder. That left Medri at the other end of the city, on his way to the pod. Hopefully.</p>
    <p>With a roar, D'argo jumped up again, aiming for the Peacekeepers he'd seen earlier, dropping two. On his right, a third one fell from what had to be Emmerit's gun. Unless there was a third party lurking around, but the old woman's distinctive yell banished that worrisome possibility. While she continued to fire, the Luxan used the cover to dash toward the building's exit. Alternating fire, he and Emmerit made it out in one piece only to be confronted by another unit closing in.</p>
    <p>"This way!" Emm shouted, ducking to the right. The two ran, dodging pedestrians and more rundown market stalls that didn't produce enough to have the right to sell inside. A blast of energy fire told them they had company. Taking refuge behind one of the larger shacks, he and Emmerit caught their breath.</p>
    <p>"Filalla," he activated his comm. "Chiana, you there?"</p>
    <p>"Bit...busy," Filalla answered. He was panting heavily.</p>
    <p>"D'argo, we have to move," said Emmerit, peeking around the corner of their shelter. Grunting he complied and, with a nod, laid down covering fire while she ran to the next shelter.</p>
    <p>"Medri! Where are you?!" he called, making his own dash for his life. The Peacekeepers were keeping their distance so far, but they had to get out of this alley and lose them.</p>
    <p>"I'm near the pod," came the crackling reply. "Patrol almost got me, but I slipped past them. Where are you?"</p>
    <p>"Coming!" The Luxan cut the conversation short. The next quarter arn passed in a blur of getting away from the Peacekeepers. Terrified, the locals kept getting in the way, panicking as the firefight cut through the city from the market to the public landing pads. D'argo only hoped the Peacekeepers hadn't taken them over yet.</p>
    <p>But they had. As soon as he and Emmerit tore into the square, they tore right back out down another alley.</p>
    <p>"What now?" Emmerit asked, trying to catch her breath.</p>
    <p>"I don't know." D'argo looked across the square where another squad of soldiers was waiting. "How did they know we'd be here?" he asked aloud. They hadn't run into any of their regular contacts since they'd entered the area. Their luck could be that bad, he supposed, but normally Pilot and Moya would have spotted them from orbit.</p>
    <p>"Pilot," he half whispered. "Pilot!" He turned to Emmerit. "Nothing." Either the comms weren't working or Moya had been captured.</p>
    <p>A sudden explosion from the hangar, made D'argo forget about the comms. A microt later, the familiar form of the transport pod launched into the air heading for the square. Both D'argo and Emmerit jumped up to get its attention, shouting into the nonfunctioning comms. Skidding to a stop in front of their hiding place, the stairs unfolded and the two scrambled up into safety.</p>
    <p>"What the frell happened?!" D'argo demanded as soon as he was in.</p>
    <p>"Where's Chiana?" Medri shouted back from the pilot's seat.</p>
    <p>"I don't know. What happened?"</p>
    <p>Medri shook his head. "Comms are out. I can't get Pilot. Did you see Chiana? Filalla?"</p>
    <p>"They're together. Near the market," D'argo took the copilot seat.</p>
    <p>"How did they find us?" asked Emmerit again of no one in particular.</p>
    <p>"We'll worry about that once we have Chiana and Fil!" Medri snapped, banking sharply. Another explosion rocked the air around them and suddenly the comms sputtered to life.</p>
    <p>"PILOT! D'ARGO! WHERE ARE YOU!?"</p>
    <p>"Filalla!" D'argo shouted. "We're coming! Where are *you*?"</p>
    <p>"Behind the dome! Hurry, Chi's blind!"</p>
    <p>"What!?" Medri's spots dropped another shade of yellow.</p>
    <p>It didn't take them long to get to the dome that dominated the city skyline. The Peacekeepers hadn't gotten back into the air yet, and from the lack of response form space, they hopefully didn't have back up. Medri was out of his chair almost before they landed, darting to the steps to help Filalla bring Chiana in.</p>
    <p>"She alright?! You okay?!" he heard the spotted man ask Chiana. Crew aboard, D'argo lost no time taking off.</p>
    <p>"I'm blind...again," Chiana whispered. "Medri?"</p>
    <p>"I'm right here."</p>
    <p>"Don't let go."</p>
    <p>D'argo powered up the engines to take them out of the atmosphere, where Moya was hopefully waiting for them. Once they were safe, they'd find out what went wrong, how the Peacekeepers had known this planet was on their course to the rendezvous with Crais. Hopefully.</p>
    <p>"I got you," Medri soothed Chiana.</p>
    <p>"Don't let go."</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"We need to talk," was the first thing Aeryn said to him when he came into the kitchen. Looking at the blackened chicken and half frozen peas, John thought the first thing they needed to do was get Aeryn away from the food.</p>
    <p>"Yeah," John agreed absently. He poked one of the chicken breasts experimentally, but it was dead and fossilized. He had some things to tell her, too.</p>
    <p>"DK has a grant from the Department of Defense to study wormholes." That got his attention. John looked up from the chicken to his wife who couldn't look less like a meek Betty Crocker if she tried. She was in her leather pants, though her shirt was a blue cotton sleeveless. Her hair was braided out of her way, and the knife she was using to chop up tomatoes was held too professionally for comfort.</p>
    <p>"Wormholes," John repeated flatly. The word itself was a jinx, calling bad times to bite them in the ass.</p>
    <p>"He wants *your* input," Aeryn went on, the emphasis not lost on John. DK and half of IASA didn't think she had two brain cells to rub together. It was always, "John. Oh, and Aeryn, I guess."</p>
    <p>"Did he say what about exactly?" Aeryn continued to glare. "Right, stupid question."</p>
    <p>"We have to stop their research," she said.</p>
    <p>John nodded and looked away. "I know." He grabbed the pot of waiting peas and put them over high heat. Wormholes. John had thought they'd escaped them. At one point, he had spent his time searching for them, calling them, using them despite the danger. Then the war had come, and there had been no time or place safe enough. They'd worked to keep the ultimate weapon from everybody at whatever the cost - and it had cost them in blood.</p>
    <p>Now, the Humans wanted wormholes; the same government that wanted superior weapons and defenses against terrorism at whatever the cost, wanted wormholes. And if John didn't give them to them... Reginard's warning echoed in his mind.</p>
    <p>"Well, I have never seen a sadder pair of cooks." John jumped at his father's voice. Jack stood in the doorway, smiling apologetically.</p>
    <p>"Mama, Dad," Rhia and Seth rushed in. John scooped up the bundle of energy that attacked him with a cry of joy. Rhia giggled, and he forgot for a moment Aeryn's worrisome news. "We snuck to the zoo!" she declared proudly, a stuffed monkey clutched tightly in her little hand. "We wore a disguise and everything to get past the reporters!"</p>
    <p>"And you didn't get caught?" asked Aeryn with a hint of a smile.</p>
    <p>"No. An' no one rec'nized us," Seth shook his head. "See?" He put on a huge pair of Groucho glasses that practically fell off his face, making them laugh. Seth giggled too, enjoying the attention.</p>
    <p>"I'll finish getting dinner ready with John if you want to get them cleaned up," Jack offered to Aeryn, nodding to the wreck of a kitchen. It was no secret that she didn't like cooking that much. So she took the kids upstairs for a quick wash before supper, leaving John and his dad alone. They worked in silence: John pensively stirred the peas while Jack scrapped off the blackened skin of the poor chickens.</p>
    <p>After about ten minutes, Dad broke the silence. "You wanna talk about it?" John shook his head. He honestly didn't. "Son," Jack folded his arms, leaned against the counter, and waited until John looked at him. "I remember when my father came back from the War, he never talked about what happened. Never. And there are some periods in my life that I never want to revisit, even in memory. So I understand if you don't want to talk about it. But it might help."</p>
    <p>John kept stirring the peas. "Did DK tell you he's got a grant to study wormholes?" he finally asked.</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>"He does. He wants my help." John paused. "And I'm going to lie to him and say I know nothing."</p>
    <p>There was silence, and John didn't dare look up. Then, "why?" John almost sighed in relief at the absence of judgment in Dad's voice.</p>
    <p>"Wormholes," he said, looking at his father this time. Jack's face held no scorn of disapproval. "Wormholes are the Holy Grail. The Ultimate Weapon. Everyone wants them, everyone fights for them. And I'm the one that has them. I can't allow anyone else, no matter how good their intentions, to have that kind of power."</p>
    <p>"What can they do?"</p>
    <p>"Destroy whole suns, planets. Populations of billions." John took the peas off the burner.</p>
    <p>"That's a hell of a responsibility," Dad commented.</p>
    <p>"You know when you said I had to be my own kind of hero?" Jack nodded. "I get that." After straining and dumping them into a bowl, the peas were ready. He thought about where he'd been, the people who counted. "Out there... I wish you could see some of the things I've seen."</p>
    <p>Dad clapped him on the shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze. "When you're ready, I will," was all he said. "Now, shall we call in the troops?" he asked, gesturing at the food. Nodding, John smiled at his old man, feeling like another bridge had been rebuilt, stronger even than the first. It was getting easier, like they were sliding back into that groove Lisa had talked about. The funny thing was, now that his dad had given him the okay not to talk, he wanted to, or at least give him the letters so they could explain what was maybe too hard to say. Smiling at the thought, he followed Dad to the dining room with the peas.</p>
    <p>*******************************</p>
    <p>Chapter 4: Into the Autoclave</p>
    <p>*******************************</p>
    <p>DK sighed when another person walked through his office door. He was supposed to be getting paperwork done, but instead he was solving everyone else's problems. This time it was Jeff who came begging for his aid.</p>
    <p>"I know you said we needed only four more people to help us with the new wormhole project, but since the brass wants another military scientist on it, and IASA wants another two from overseas, and neither of them is willing to swap something, as the budget stands now, we're gonna have to redefine some of our objectives or..."</p>
    <p>"Pull up a chair," DK told his stressed friend. It had been two weeks since they'd received the grant, and since then they'd been nailing down the final divisions of manpower and resources. Due to the potential use of wormholes as a link between Earth and the universe, world governments wanted a hand in it, too.</p>
    <p>He and Jeff spent a good half hour going over the budget and personnel, pulling something together that would hopefully satisfy both them and the other parties involved without causing apoplectic shock. By the time DK finally got Jeff out the door, Yora was coming in with another cup of coffee for him and a request to get his ass down to the hangar so they could go over the Farscape III's backup thruster systems together.</p>
    <p>"DK, I know today's supposed to be an office day, but yesterday they replaced half the coolant system, so we gotta check this today before they put in the primaries," Yora told him reasonably. "They're already a week behind schedule."</p>
    <p>The engineer groaned and let his head hit the desk with a satisfying thud. "Give me an hour," he mumbled. "Can't you do it yourself?"</p>
    <p>"No, it's not as fun," said Yora. "I'll be back in sixty. And drink your coffee!"</p>
    <p>DK had two full minutes of peace before his next visitor, the infamous Aeryn Sun. She walked in without bothering to knock. "Do you have a location for your wormhole research yet?" she demanded without preamble.</p>
    <p>DK sighed and nodded. The alien had been cool towards him ever since she had found out he'd gotten the grant. At first she'd tried to get him to stop it all together, but even had he wanted to, it had already been too late. He had tried asking John about it, but had only received a similar reaction. At first he'd been heart broken that John hadn't known anything, and worse, wasn't even excited about the new project as DK had been sure he would be. But there wasn't much he could do about it except make the best of it. It wasn't like he and John had never disagreed before, but so soon after getting him back, it hurt more.</p>
    <p>"We got hold of one of the labs in the Braun building," he told her.</p>
    <p>"Which one?"</p>
    <p>"Two-sixteen. Why? I thought you were against the project."</p>
    <p>"I am." Then, just as suddenly as she had arrived, she left, leaving DK confused. If she didn't want the program to go forward, why did she want to know where it was? It didn't make sense. Oh, well, he was just glad she was gone. Over the last couple of weeks, things had been tense between them.</p>
    <p>Not one to dwell on what couldn't be helped, DK turned back to his inbox. Only to be interrupted again halfway through the first page of a supply request form by a rap on the doorframe.</p>
    <p>"Knock, knock, Sailor," a soft, feminine voice greeted him. He looked up in shock. Laurie Martin. DK couldn't believe it. A grin splitting his face, he jumped up around his desk to give the lady a hug.</p>
    <p>"Laurie! What are you doing here?" he demanded happily, thumping her on the back. "Last I heard you were on the USS Whatsit out in the Pacific."</p>
    <p>"I was in the neighborhood," she said coyly when he finally let her go. DK gave her a look, and she laughed. "Okay," she conceded, "I was transferred to Andrews just down the coast. So, like it or not, Sailor, I'm here to stay. Until I'm transferred again, of course," she laughed once more, clear and ringing. DK loved that about her, that she loved to laugh.</p>
    <p>"So what's a Navy Nurse like you doing in a space place like this?" he asked ushering her into a chair.</p>
    <p>"Gotta make sure you flyboys don't drown when you land in the water," Laurie answered, accepting the offer. DK cleared off another one by the side table and sat. "What?" she asked innocently at his look. "A girl can't come to see an old friend?"</p>
    <p>"A girl like you always kills two or three birds with one stone," DK grinned. "And I know I don't rate that high on the food chain."</p>
    <p>"DK, of course you do," she swatted his arm in mock disapproval. "Besides, it's classified, so it will have to do."</p>
    <p>He laughed, knowing better than to push her. "If you say so, DoctorNurse," DK saluted her playfully. Not only was Laurie a Major in the Naval Nursing Corps, but she had a PhD in Biochemistry as well.</p>
    <p>"I do," Laurie deadpanned. "Now, I want to know absolutely everything! And don't be shy! I know you were close to Crichton when he died or disappeared or whatever. You certainly cried enough on my shoulder to float a boat. So spill."</p>
    <p>DK watched as Laurie settled in with all the eagerness of a teenage girl gossiping about who's going with who. When she was ready with one de-shoed foot tucked up underneath her, he told her everything she'd missed while on the Pacific Ocean. Pent up frustrations with John's resistance to science and the wormhole project. The cheapness he felt with the Farscape project now that John and Aeryn had come back with the new technology, like his work for the last five years had been wasted - the guilt that went with the feeling. The tensions from his team who felt the same way, the difficulties with the press constantly around the building - he poured his heart onto his old friend's shoulder one more time, while she sat and patiently listened.</p>
    <p>"It's not that I don't want him back. I do, God knows I do. But he died, and I learned to live without him. Now I have to live with him again, but he's changed so much, I don't know where I stand with him anymore. I though he'd be pleased with the wormhole thing, you know, find out what knocked him to that other galaxy, and he just told me to drop it. Turns out he knows more than he's telling and he doesn't want anything to with them. And now, Aeryn comes in asking what lab we're in...I don't know what her problem is. John and I, we used to be able to talk about anything. Now we talk about stuff and hit a wall. It's been what? Four months? It's just so frustrating."</p>
    <p>"But it is getting better, right?" Laurie asked.</p>
    <p>DK sighed. "It was till this whole wormhole thing. John says that in the wrong hands, wormholes are weapons of the worst kind. It's like he doesn't trust me. Me! I've known him since we were toddlers, and he doesn't trust me enough to talk to me or do this project!"</p>
    <p>That's what hurt the most, that neither John nor Aeryn trusted him. It hurt like the hole in his heart he thought had healed. They were so suspicious of everyone, and he'd thought he was on the good guy list.</p>
    <p>"You know," said Laurie. "People keep on living even when they're away from home. You moved on, and he moved on. Things happen. Thing change 'em. I mean, I can remember when I first came home from Basic, my parents didn't get what I'd gone through. And I couldn't explain it to them. But we worked through it. It just takes time."</p>
    <p>"Somewhere I know that. Doesn't make it easier," DK sighed.</p>
    <p>Another knock on the door interrupted the comfortable silence they had fallen into, but it was only Yora for the backup systems inspection. After quickly introducing them, he and Laurie made their goodbyes.</p>
    <p>"I'll come by and see you later," she said, returning his hug.</p>
    <p>"Thanks for stopping by. Letting me cry in your ear," DK smiled.</p>
    <p>"Anytime, Sailor." With a last wave, Laurie headed to the right towards the elevators.</p>
    <p>Grabbing the relevant folder, DK left with Yora for the hangar in the other direction, feeling much better.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Lewis!" the President shouted into the bustle of the anteroom. The crowd working overtime barely glanced up before ducking back into their work. Damn it! His aide's cell phone was off or dead or being finicky just to piss Landers off for the hell of it. "I want to see Lewis as soon as he sets foot in the building," he snapped at a nearby secretary. "And get me Locher on the phone." He stormed back into his office.</p>
    <p>Nearly yanking the drawer out of the desk, Landers pulled out his bottle of Excedrin and took two of the pills, willing himself to calm down. He had to be able to think clearly, not an easy feat when you'd just found out another twenty American service men had lost their lives in Pakistan. A new creative bomb launched at the USS Morrison that had been stationed near the port city Ormara. Landers picked up the phone again. "Tell Richard I need a statement," he said. Probably wasn't necessary, but it made him feel like he was doing something.</p>
    <p>The phone rang in the same instant that the door opened. Snatching up the apparatus, he waved Lewis to a seat. "Locher? What do you have for me?"</p>
    <p>The voice on the other end sounded harried but trying to hide it. "Mr. President, I understand the urgency of the situation, but I simply cannot make Crichton work faster. These things take time. The intellectual gap between -"</p>
    <p>"I don't want details," Landers cut him off. "Just give me results. Get them." He hung up and turned to Lewis who was seated in his customary chair. "Talk to me."</p>
    <p>"The time table for the new Defense program is still on schedule and at maximum. There is no way to move it up. The reports from IASA and Major Fanby show that getting and making some of the necessary materials for hybrid weapons will possibly slow down production, especially since Crichton has not yet shown much interest in detailing weapons."</p>
    <p>"Get him to."</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir," Lewis made a quick note on his Palm Pilot. "The USS Greer has reached the Morrison and started the evacuation. The Joint Chiefs will be ready for a meeting at five. The press is waiting for a statement. Richard just sent me a bulletin; it's almost ready. The press conference is at four. Mike should be able to handle it, but it would probably help if you put in an appearance. Oh, and on a side note, Representative Davis will probably get off on lack of intent."</p>
    <p>"What?" The sudden shift in direction had Landers unsure that he'd heard that right.</p>
    <p>"Davis. Alien assassination attempt. He claims that the 'donation' he made to In Jesus Name was never intended to be used for 'such a heinous act', I believe he put it. Judge will most likely fine him."</p>
    <p>"Just make sure Crichton doesn't get a hold of his address," Landers sighed. He had no doubt that the astronaut would go after the Congressman once he learned that the man ultimately responsible for his wounding his wife was getting off with a slap on the wrist. "And he's still resisting giving us weapons technology?"</p>
    <p>"With all due respect, sir, he's more concerned with protecting the planet from space. His last report said that even with the equivalent firepower on the ground, superior ships from orbit would either target cities from space or release a biologic agent to wipe out resistance. Then he basically told us to stop asking."</p>
    <p>"Do you believe him?"</p>
    <p>"Reginard does."</p>
    <p>Landers pushed his glasses up to rub his eyes. When had life been simple? he asked himself for the hundredth time that week. Well, he'd asked for the job of keeping the world in line.</p>
    <p>"What time is it?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"3:44," Lewis told him, glancing at his little device. He punched a few buttons then added, "Richard's on his way."</p>
    <p>Landers nodded. "Alright. Let's go. We'll finish this after the press conference."</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Jack turned the page from one star chart to another, marveling at the number of them in John's notebooks. He smiled, reading again some of the names his son had given the stars, jumping from theme to theme like Mickey Mouse, *Cheers*, and football teams. And they all revolved around Aeryn. John certainly was a hopeless romantic.</p>
    <p>His son had only given him the tapes, the letters to him, and a few of the many notebooks sitting on the bookshelf. The rest he'd said should wait until he came home, so Jack hadn't pressed for more; it already meant a lot that John was willing to share this much with him. Listening and reading them made him ache for what John had gone through and created more questions about the missing times. Jack was almost afraid to know what had happened. In his letters he read about despair and joy, hatred and love, loss, insanity. It seemed like there were more bad times than good, and Jack's heart went out to him.</p>
    <p>Idly, he flipped through the letters one more time, a sentence here and there jumping out at him. "Scorpy's dead. Finally. The bastard had more lives than a demonic cat. -- I cut off his head, just to be sure. -- Dad, guess what?! You're a grandfather! Yep, Rhia Xala Sun. Pilot finally got his memory back and let me in to see them. -- She's so beautiful! -- I hate them so much for what they did to her. Pip is the last person who deserves to be used and manipulated like that." They went on, John's heart and soul poured onto the paper into an ear he never thought would hear.</p>
    <p>"Gran'pa! Gran'pa! Dere's a man a' the door!" Seth tore into the room at top speed as usual, managing not to trip over his feet for once. Jack put aside the notebook and followed Seth to the vestibule where Rhia was standing guard with a kitchen knife.</p>
    <p>"Rhia, go put that up," he told her. It unnerved him when she did things like that, prepared to defend Seth and the house from intruders.</p>
    <p>"But he's banging," she protested.</p>
    <p>"Go put the knife away," Jack repeated, steering her toward the kitchen. "Why don't you two stay there till I see what the man wants." The two went, looking over their shoulders nervously.</p>
    <p>Flipping the lock, Jack opened the door to find an angry Giller on the doorstep. The security man was dressed impeccably in a suit as usual but carried a waist-high signpost in his left hand.</p>
    <p>"Colonel Crichton," he greeted Jack. "Is the Commander in?" The polite tone did little to hide the dislike behind the words.</p>
    <p>"No," said Jack flatly. "What do you want?"</p>
    <p>Giller turned the signpost so he could see its face. Bright red letters proclaimed across the top "Final Warning." Just below was a blown up picture of Mark lying on the ground, bleeding and theatrically dead. He wore a press pass. Beneath was written "Keep Out."</p>
    <p>"Tell Crichton, I'll have a warrant for his arrest if he threatens the media again."</p>
    <p>"Over my dead body."</p>
    <p>"Tell him." Giller dropped the sign and left, walking briskly to his black government car.</p>
    <p>Jack shook his head as he picked up the sign. So that's why things had calmed down around here, he thought. Pretty effective since his son had the reputation to back it up. He took the sign inside, closed, and locked the door.</p>
    <p>"Will Dad be executed if he's arrested?"</p>
    <p>Jack looked up, startled to see Rhia and Seth staring at him, eyes wide in fear. Surprised, he shook his head. "No, sweetie. You can't sentence someone to death for threats. Besides, there's no way he could even be convicted. Giller's just trying to scare us," he said reassuringly. The kids didn't look convinced.</p>
    <p>"Come on, let's go read a story," he suggested. That usually took their minds off things. He'd been amazed that they hadn't taken to the television, though they did like *Sesame Street* from time to time. For the rest, they didn't have the attention span.</p>
    <p>So, still apprehensive, the children followed Jack to the living room and settled down to listen to The Little Cargo Hauler That Could.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"And this brings us to the fine tradition of embarrassing the birthday girl," Mark explained to Aeryn. "Since Ryan can't do it 'cause he's the husband, it's up to me and the boys to do our sacred duty." He paused theatrically, resting the tips of his fingers on his collarbone like a noble lord. And Aeryn actually laughed. It was the first time Ryan had heard the sound from her. At Christmas she had been, understandably, reserved, and hadn't participated much beyond watching the kids. Now, mid February, she seemed to have adjusted to Earth.</p>
    <p>It was Melanie's fortieth birthday party, and the Crichtons could not pass up the opportunity to get together. Ryan sat with Aeryn, Mark, Robert, and Ben in the living room with several of his and Melanie's close friends. Mark had pulled out the pictures specially prepared for the event. Aeryn's induction to family gatherings was his excuse to embarrass his sister in-law.</p>
    <p>"Now," Mark looked up at his audience, "we begin our story forty long, dark years ago -"</p>
    <p>"Wait!" Lisa rushed in, pulling Melanie by the arm, followed closely by John, Jack, and a few other friends who had been helping them out on the grill. Amid shouts and cheers, Melanie was forced to take the place of honor in the overstuffed armchair. The rest of the guests piled in, pulling up the extra chairs and even sitting on the floor, though with David, Rhia, and Seth running around wild, it was a little dangerous.</p>
    <p>"We begin our story," Mark said again, louder this time to get everyone's attention, "forty *long*, *terrible*, *dark* years ago." More cheers rose. "With the birth, that fateful February morning of the last Crichton child, baby Melanie." Mark held up the first photo of a baby in a pink blanket, enlarged for the purpose of being passed around. From there, Mark wove a tale of growing up, from one picture to the next, most of them the most embarrassing ones he could find - and Ryan should know since he had helped pick them out. Ryan let the familiar stories wash over him for the hundredth time, enjoying the laughter and friendship that pulsed through the room.</p>
    <p>"And then came that event that all young girls anxiously await: the first training bra!" The picture Mark held up was of a lump: a vaguely girl shaped figure covered by a towel.</p>
    <p>"Oh, come on," Melanie protested amid the laughter. "Who was not embarrassed?" she demanded.</p>
    <p>"You have to train to have breasts?" Aeryn asked, studying the picture with a smile.</p>
    <p>"No, a training bra is just one that's made for girls that's smaller than normal," Lisa explained.</p>
    <p>"I can understand why you hid your face then," Aeryn looked at Mel with a wicked grin.</p>
    <p>The story continued on to junior high dances, high school boyfriends - and John checking them out, college and beyond, glazing over the painful times of Leslie's death, Steven Whirel, and John's Farscape accident. Melanie made it through these latter years her relatively unscathed in comparison to her youth, until finally, "The crowning achievement, one of the *best* Christmas dinners I have ever eaten," Mark announced with conviction with the picture of the recent Christmas spread. "Thank God, Lisa cooked most of it!"</p>
    <p>"Why you -" Melanie screeched, throwing a cushion at him. Sensing an imminent fight, Ryan quickly got to his feet.</p>
    <p>"To Melanie Rebecca Crichton Phillipson," he raised his beer. "The most wonderful woman in the world. Happy birthday!"</p>
    <p>"To Melanie," the rest echoed. Ryan sidled up to the woman he loved and gave her a chaste kiss. There were more cheers and chinks, then the group settled into smaller groups, dodging kids and forgotten cups. The burger contingent went back out to the grill, and Ryan wormed himself a spot on the couch between Aeryn and Robert who had found a photo album.</p>
    <p>"So, ready for your birthday?" he asked his newest sister in-law cheerfully.</p>
    <p>Aeryn smiled at him and said, "Good thing I don't know when it is."</p>
    <p>"Don't worry, we'll make one up for you. Get John to tell us all your embarrassing stories," he said, reassuringly. Aeryn only smiled serenely at him.</p>
    <p>"So what are birthday parties like on your planet?" asked Robert eagerly, though he tried to be casual about it.</p>
    <p>However, before she could answer, John called out, "Aeryn, could you give me a hand?"</p>
    <p>Smiling an, "excuse me," she got up and left. Ryan watched her go.</p>
    <p>"What do you need?" she asked when she reached John in the doorway, still close enough for them to overhear.</p>
    <p>"Just your hand," he answered, reaching down and pulling it to his lips.</p>
    <p>"Is this another one of your Earth customs?" she asked, pleased.</p>
    <p>"Just thought you might want a change in conversation. Come on. Maybe Melanie will talk to me with you around." He pulled her away to the dining room. Deciding he needed another beer, Ryan followed. Okay, so he was curious and a little worried. After the last time Mel had gone one-on-one with her brother... Ryan thought a little nearby damage control wouldn't hurt.</p>
    <p>Melanie was talking with Lisa by the china cabinet when they approached somewhat nervously. "Happy birthday, Mel," John said by way of greeting. "Finally joined the rest of us over the hill."</p>
    <p>Melanie didn't answer right away, and at first, Ryan was afraid she wasn't going to answer at all. But she did. "Thank you, John, and Aeryn," she said.</p>
    <p>"Mel..." John went on but didn't seem to remember how. "I'm sorry I wasn't there."</p>
    <p>"Yeah, well." Ryan saw her nod and look away as she always did when she didn't want to say something but was going to anyway. "I don't know whether to hate you or love you," she told him.</p>
    <p>"You never could choose between anything," John replied fondly. "Remember the sweaters? And the car? God, I swore off shopping with you forever."</p>
    <p>Despite herself, Melanie smiled. "I think I'll go with hating you, mister." But Ryan could tell she didn't mean it, not really. "*So*, Aeryn," Mel pointedly ignored John, linking her sister-in-law's arm with hers. "Let's have a chat about John. Just the juicy bits."</p>
    <p>"That sounds like fun," said Lisa, taking Aeryn's other arm. The black haired woman grinned evilly.</p>
    <p>"I do have to catch you up for his birthday," she said with a sly glance over her shoulder at her husband.</p>
    <p>"Oh, man," said John as Ryan joined him, handing him a fresh beer. "Now I'm in trouble." Watching the three ladies leave, heads together, Ryan could only agree.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>He had just hung up the phone with Washington when his new charges walked in the door: a black suit and two Navy dress uniforms. Reginard was not looking forward to this. "Dr. McPhearson, I presume?" he stood holding out his hand.</p>
    <p>The man in the suit shook it. "Ambassador Reginard." He didn't smile. "May I present Colonel Walter Sarratt and Major Laurie Martin, Navy Medicine." Reginard shook both their hands. "I trust you have received our orders?"</p>
    <p>"Uh, yes. I was just going over them. Please, sit down." Reginard moved back behind his desk while his visitors made themselves comfortable. "As I understand it, the facilities at Andrews are the best for your research and that's why the Navy is in charge of this project?"</p>
    <p>"*I* am in charge of this project," McPhearson clarified.</p>
    <p>"I see." Reginard looked back at the orders, which were infinitely more comfortable to look at than the good doctor. "You are aware that our contract with Crichton prohibits any and all medical testing?"</p>
    <p>"At this stage we do not require medical testing. We simply need to interview Crichton and the alien. One of his reports specified the threat of biological and chemical warfare. When medical testing becomes necessary, I would think that the greater good that would come from our investigating the aliens' DNA would outweigh a simple contract."</p>
    <p>He said it with such calm that Reginard almost shivered. "You haven't met Crichton, have you?"</p>
    <p>If anything McPhearson's gaze became colder. "Coming here was just a formality. You will give us your full cooperation, Ambassador." He paused and the silence felt like lead. "Now," the doctor continued. "I need to speak with a Dr. Amelia Hargrove. I want to do the preliminary interviews today."</p>
    <p>McPhearson stood, Sarratt and Martin following him out the door. Reginard thought he saw a look of sympathy from the Major, but shook it away. Anyone who worked with that bastard... Reginard didn't know what he was going to do. This was bordering on a direct breach of the contract, and Crichton would never stand for it, that much he was sure of. But it looked like the boys up top were getting desperate, if the operation was even sanctioned at all. Glancing over their papers one more time, Reginard didn't know. He picked up his phone to call his superiors, but before he had dialed two numbers, the PA announced, "Ambassador Reginard, please report to the Control Room. Ambassador Reginard."</p>
    <p>Within five minutes, he came running in only to stop short when he saw the screen. Moya had returned.</p>
    <p>************************</p>
    <p>Chapter 5: Morose Code</p>
    <p>************************</p>
    <p>"No, I want to talk to John alone," D'argo repeated. Why couldn't they get their heads around that?</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid that's not possible," the Human Reginard replied. "We have very strict protocols that govern extraplanatary contact. Until you state the nature of your visit, I'm afraid I can't allow Commander Crichton to speak with you."</p>
    <p>"I want to talk to Crichton! That is the nature of our visit!" D'argo shouted. "Does he even know we're here?"</p>
    <p>Reginard shook his head. "I'm very sorry. If I could change the rules, I would but my hands are tied."</p>
    <p>"Ka D'argo," Pilot interrupted.</p>
    <p>"Yes, Pilot?" D'argo slammed a frustrated hand on the consul, cutting Earth off.</p>
    <p>"I have reached Rhia on the comms."</p>
    <p>D'argo sighed in relief. "Thank you." It's what they had tried first, but no answer had come back. Then Earth, recognizing them on their scans had contacted them wanting to talk. Why did Humans always want to talk? he asked himself. "Rhia? Is that you?"</p>
    <p>"D'argo?!" the child's voice was filled with excitement. "You're here?"</p>
    <p>The Luxan smiled, mirrored by Emmerit and Rygel who were in Command with him. "Yes. Is John there?"</p>
    <p>"He's at work. They're always at work, but the men come when they don't go," Rhia informed them sadly. "We had Christmas!"</p>
    <p>"That's wonderful, Rhia," D'argo said, though he didn't know what Christmas was. "Is there any way you can contact John for me? It's important."</p>
    <p>"I'll ask Grandpa," she said. "Grandpa! Can I call Mama and Dad?" they heard her shout. In the background another voice spoke, but it was too distant to understand. "It's important." The voice spoke again. "D'argo? Can I tell him it's you?"</p>
    <p>"Ah..." He might take the comm away from Rhia and then they'd never get John or Aeryn. On the other hand, without Jack, Rhia might not be able to get John at all. He was about to ask what the others thought when Rhia spoke again.</p>
    <p>"I'll get Seth to play with him. Then he won't notice."</p>
    <p>"Sounds like Rhia has a plan," commented Emmerit with a smile.</p>
    <p>"She was always a clever girl," Rygel added smugly as if he were her father. D'argo resisted the urge to roll his eyes.</p>
    <p>A few microts later, Rhia came back. "Can I talk to my Mama or Dad?" A pause. "It's her daughter...Mama?...D'argo wants to talk to you...He's on your comm." A scrapping noise followed then, "D'argo?"</p>
    <p>"Aeryn." The relief he felt at hearing her voice was palpable.</p>
    <p>"D'argo? Rhia, push the speaker button." A sharp sound screeched over the comm making the crew wince.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn?"</p>
    <p>"D'argo? Where are you?"</p>
    <p>"Earth orbit. They wouldn't let us talk to you."</p>
    <p>"Those frelling -"</p>
    <p>It was definitely Aeryn on the other end of whatever communication device Rhia had hooked them up with. "We need to talk to you."</p>
    <p>"But your Humans won't let us," Rygel finished.</p>
    <p>"They're paranoid," said Aeryn quietly. "It's like living with a hundred Starks."</p>
    <p>"Are you alone?" asked D'argo.</p>
    <p>"No. And they think I'm talking to Rhia, but it's all right. Only two of them have microbes and they're too far away to hear."</p>
    <p>"Where's John?"</p>
    <p>"Meeting. Probably off fighting someone who wants to make useless weapons. They want to use what we have to kill each other. They don't care about improving their space fleet."</p>
    <p>"Look Aeryn, we need to talk to both of you."</p>
    <p>"As soon as possible," Emmerit added. "Talyn and Crais are missing."</p>
    <p>"Among other things," muttered Rygel.</p>
    <p>There was silence on the other end. "Rhia," Aeryn finally said. "I want you to tell Grandpa Jack what's happening and get him to take you and Seth to his house, all right? And don't forget the comm. D'argo, I'll contact you as soon as it's safe. I have to go. Good to hear your voice." There was another sound then it cut off.</p>
    <p>"D'argo?" asked Rhia. "What's happening?"</p>
    <p>"Rhia, go with your grandfather somewhere safe. We'll see you soon," D'argo said. He disconnected and turned to the others. Chiana, Jool, and Medri had joined them, all looking concerned. "She sounded tense," he observed.</p>
    <p>"Do you think they're okay?" asked Chiana.</p>
    <p>"I hope so," D'argo sighed. They were supposed to be safe down there, and it didn't sound like anything had happened, but the tone of Aeryn's voice made him uneasy.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Everything all right at home?" Dan asked when she hung up.</p>
    <p>Aeryn shook her head. She had to talk to D'argo and in order to do that, she needed to get to the house. "I need to go," she told them at large, switching back to English.</p>
    <p>"What's wrong?" Kiwi asked for the group, the concern showing on her face. The others as well seemed worried for her.</p>
    <p>"It's..." What could Aeryn say to get them to let her go without a fuss? Gathering up her things, she said the first thing that came to her mind. "It's nothing serious, but Seth fell and they need me. I'll see you tomorrow."</p>
    <p>Aeryn left before they could say anything more. She barely noticed the halls, her mind occupied by the phone call. Moya was here and no one had told them. Why? Why would the Humans hide it? Was it about power and control again? And more importantly, why had Moya come back? It was a terrible risk; D'argo knew that. They had planned to stay on Earth for at least two cycles maybe more without contact from Moya. Talyn and Crais missing. Four words that chilled her to the bone. Something was seriously wrong if a powerful warship and a knowledgeable ex Peacekeeper captain were missing in action - 'among other things'. She had to find out what.</p>
    <p>When she reached the administration building, Aeryn decided to take a detour and get John. He would need to hear this too, and it couldn't wait. The elevator took too long, so Aeryn ran up the stairs to the second floor. In the conference room at the end of the hall, Aeryn found her husband staring stonily at Giller and a man she had never seen before.</p>
    <p>"John." She strode into the room like she owned it, customs be damned. "I just got a call from Rhia," she said in Sebacean. "She said her godparents are here for an unexpected visit."</p>
    <p>"Ms. Sun, this is a private meeting, and you will speak English!" Giller jumped to his feet, but Aeryn paid him no mind.</p>
    <p>"They want to talk to us right away. Talyn and Crais are missing," she continued.</p>
    <p>John's face barely twitched as he got to his feet. "Frell."</p>
    <p>"We are not finished here," Giller protested but they ignored him, not even bothering with the explanation she'd given Dan.</p>
    <p>"We are now," John told him. He moved to go around the security chief, but Giller stepped back into his path. "I do not have time for this Giller," said John coldly.</p>
    <p>"I don't think you understand your position here, Crichton," Giller responded nastily. Aeryn had had enough and yanked Giller out of the way from behind. She didn't quite knock him out, not that she cared. The other man looked slightly taken aback but made no move to stop them. Leaving Giller sprawled on the floor, she and John headed for the parking lot.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"So they're at Dad's?" asked John when Aeryn had finished filling him in on what she knew. She nodded in reply, staring intently at the road before them. The ride didn't take long, especially since Dad's place was closer than theirs. It was a good idea of Aeryn's to get them there, not only for the distance reasons but the reporter ones as well. The sign had helped, but there were always a few die-hards lurking around. Neither of them spoke much, both absorbed in the same thoughts of 'why'. Why were they here? And why hadn't they been told?</p>
    <p>The front of the house was dark as if nobody were home. John shut off the engine, and he and Aeryn went to the door where Dad was waiting for them.</p>
    <p>"Rhia says Moya's back?" was the first thing he said.</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Aeryn as they entered the house. "They contacted her on the comm. We need to talk to them right away."</p>
    <p>"Of course. I think Rhia still has it." They went to the living room where the kids were playing with blocks on the floor. Both of them jumped up and ran to their parents as soon as they saw them come in.</p>
    <p>"Up!" Seth ordered. John gathered his son into his arms and hugged him close. Meanwhile, Aeryn had accepted the comm from Rhia.</p>
    <p>"D'argo, Pilot? It's Aeryn. Are you there?"</p>
    <p>"Aeryn!" came the Luxan's voice, loud and relieved. "Is everything alright?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, we can talk now. John's here."</p>
    <p>"Hey, D. Heard you were in the neighborhood. What's up?"</p>
    <p>They heard D'argo sigh and in the background, several others talking one on top of the other until the Luxan told them to shut the frell up. It was nice to hear that some things hadn't changed, John thought with a smile.</p>
    <p>But the feeling of warmth at hearing his friends' voices gave way to the clenching of his gut when D'argo spoke again. "We told you Talyn and Crais are missing. We were heading to the rendezvous, and when we stopped for supplies on the way, a Peacekeeper squadron ambushed us. They didn't have backup, so we think they'd been lying in wait. We had another close encounter several days later, then when we reached the rendezvous, no Talyn, no Crais. Fil and I went out to check the message drops but nothing."</p>
    <p>"So you think they were captured?" asked Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"And interrogated," Rygel finished from the other end.</p>
    <p>"And that's not all," Medri picked up the narration, his voice a little less clear. "We went to Colony space to see if their spies or the Alliance had any information. Kitall, one of their outlying planets had been taken over by the Peacekeepers."</p>
    <p>"We regrouped with Martya and her crew in the nebula beyond the Riders' territory," D'argo resumed. "They'd picked up some of the lucky ones who said it was only the beginning. The Peacekeepers want the whole system."</p>
    <p>John heard the words but they hadn't sunk in yet, and he didn't want them to. The Breakaway Colonies were one of the strongest forces against both the Peacekeepers and the Scarrans. "The Royal Planet?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"No word."</p>
    <p>John looked at Aeryn, sitting beside him on his father's couch, elbows on her knees. When she glanced at him, he saw what he felt: the need to go and help. They couldn't ignore this. It was Talyn, the ship they'd helped raise, and Crais who, while John disliked him on principle, was still a friend and ally. Not to mention the threat to the Royal Planet. They couldn't let it fall. If they did, then any hope of surviving this war intact was virtually nil.</p>
    <p>Eyes still locked on Aeryn's, John said, "We'll need a couple of days to get everything in order."</p>
    <p>"Don't take too long." The comm went out.</p>
    <p>The room was silent. In his armchair, Dad said nothing, his face unreadable. Rhia was staring at them wide-eyed, old enough to get the basics of D'argo's news and scared by it. Aeryn was looking at her hands, thinking. In his lap, Seth shifted so he could look John in the eye. "Are we goin' home?" he asked.</p>
    <p>John looked into his son's hopeful face, chubby and innocent. Clear, certain eyes stared back, cutting through the turmoil in John's own mind. Home. Moya and the Uncharted Territories where someone was always trying to kill them. Was that it? Where he had met Aeryn and D'argo and Rygel and Chiana and lived and died and made a difference in however an insignificant way?</p>
    <p>Thinking back to that meeting with Giller and the doctor, over the last few months, it was clear. On Earth, he was just as suspected, badgered, and threatened. On Earth, he didn't sleep well at night. He'd felt it everyday in every conversation that fell flat, every look he got from across the room, and every feeling of distrust he'd had for strangers since they'd returned. He hadn't wanted to admit it; he'd told himself that he would adjust. But now that Seth had put it into words, he couldn't ignore it. He no longer belonged on Earth.</p>
    <p>He remembered telling Dad that he had figured out what it meant to be his own kind of hero. And it was out there, fighting.</p>
    <p>He looked at his father, noticing the wrinkles again as if for the first time. "Dad..."</p>
    <p>"You have to leave," his father finished with a sad smile. John thought he saw a glimmer in his eye, but then it was gone.</p>
    <p>"It's Talyn," John felt the need to explain. He wanted him to understand that he wasn't just abandoning him.</p>
    <p>"Moya's son. And on the Royal Planet, you have an unborn daughter. A princess," Jack finished again. John nodded, feeling the old understanding flow between them, unbarred and strong. He didn't need to explain because Dad already understood. "What do you need me to do?"</p>
    <p>"If you could watch the kids while we make plans," Aeryn gestured to the two who were listening with rapt attention. "Thank you, Jack."</p>
    <p>"I wanna help!" wailed Rhia.</p>
    <p>"Me too!" Seth added, hitting John's arm to get his attention. John's mind, already running over the problems they would face getting off the planet, reigned itself in. How could they help without being in danger or daring to go after it?</p>
    <p>"Okay, listen close," he said motioning Rhia to come over. "I want you two to make a list of all your things that you want to take back to Moya and write where they are at the house, so when we go, we can pack quickly." Excited by the assignment, Rhia and Seth both nodded before running off to find paper.</p>
    <p>"That should keep them occupied," said Aeryn, watching them go.</p>
    <p>"So what do you need to do before you leave?" asked Jack.</p>
    <p>John looked at Aeryn. "Talk to Dan and Reginard. Get them plans of the systems they need to build."</p>
    <p>"Take care of the wormhole research."</p>
    <p>"Steal my module back."</p>
    <p>"Get our things out of the house without being stopped," they threw suggestions back and forth.</p>
    <p>"I can help at the house," Dad told them. He wasn't going to try and stop them - John almost couldn't believe it.</p>
    <p>"All right," he said, standing. "We're gonna need some paper."</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>He knocked on the side of the door hesitantly, wondering what had possessed him to volunteer to tell her. Sure, things were better than they had been but it still wasn't the same.</p>
    <p>"Yeah?" Chiana asked from the inside. Willing his spots not to give him away, Medri opened the door.</p>
    <p>"Uh, hi." She waited and didn't look away. Taking that as an invitation to continue, he did so. "Aeryn and John just commed back," he said. "We're going to pick them up tomorrow."</p>
    <p>Chiana nodded and even made a space for him on the bed. She was sorting through what looked like junk to him but what doubtless had meaning for her. Essor was nowhere to be seen, but that was only normal. Medri sat down somewhat gingerly.</p>
    <p>"So what's the plan?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"They're going to steal the module and sneak out. Meet John's father with the children."</p>
    <p>"They'll need a backup plan," the Nebari smiled wanly.</p>
    <p>"Yeah." Medri agreed. She had recovered from her temporary blindness, but still looked a little worse for wear. "Are you, you know, okay?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Sure. No." Chiana smiled at her own correction but didn't elaborate. She turned back to her sorting, and Medri watched her toss the pieces into seemingly random piles.</p>
    <p>"Okay," he finally said, at a loss. "It's almost mealtime. I better..." he stood up and watched her sort a few more pieces. Just ask, he told himself. "You wanna come with me?"</p>
    <p>She looked up, surprised, but in the end she nodded. Chiana grabbed a box from the floor on the other side of the bed and swept the junk back into it. She would have to resort it, thought Medri. But she didn't seem to mind.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Aeryn blinked her eyes hard, tired yet too wired to sleep. It was late. Jack had already gone to bed, leaving her and John still working on plans. John was writing furiously, open notebooks guiding and giving him ideas. He looked tired. "Hey, are you all right?" she asked him.</p>
    <p>John stopped writing and rubbed his eyes with the hand that held the pen. "I think if I do this," he gestured to the table, "I don't have to think about it." He looked up at her. "It's not working." He sighed. "I'm going to miss them."</p>
    <p>Aeryn understood. So would she. "I am glad we came," she said.</p>
    <p>"But...?" John said with a teasing smile.</p>
    <p>"But I'm also glad Moya came back early."</p>
    <p>John waited a beat then said, "Me too."</p>
    <p>Aeryn raised her eyebrows in surprise. For as long as she'd known him, coming back to Earth had been his dream, even when he was willing to give it all up for her. She didn't think he would give it up so easily.</p>
    <p>He smiled this time for her. "You think I'm crazy, maybe I am. But Seth was right. Moya's home."</p>
    <p>"And your family?"</p>
    <p>"I'll always love them. And now they know I'm alright." He shrugged and got up to get another cup of coffee. His body said it wasn't as easy as he made it sound.</p>
    <p>But Aeryn didn't press. "Good thing we haven't told them how many times you've died." She passed him her mug, and with a snort, he filled it for her.</p>
    <p>"If we'd done that then we'd never be leaving," he said, sitting down again. "But that's part of it."</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"That they'll never understand."</p>
    <p>Aeryn nodded. She understood that, too. Coming here for him was like going back to the command carrier for her. Everything the same except them.</p>
    <p>John looked at the table spread before him. "I think you need to pull up a chair if we're gonna get this done by eight." Vaguely, he waved his coffee at the mess of papers. Aeryn grabbed a pencil while John took one last sip before setting his mug down. He had just begun to write again when she asked:</p>
    <p>"Are you really okay?"</p>
    <p>John looked up, surprised by the question, but then he nodded. "Yeah. We have family out there too."</p>
    <p>Satisfied, Aeryn took his hand and squeezed it. Then they got to work.</p>
    <p>******************************************************</p>
    <p>Chapter 6: Adieu, Adieu, To Yieu, and Yieu, and Yieu</p>
    <p>******************************************************</p>
    <p>"Here." John handed him a steaming cup of coffee when he walked into the kitchen. His son's clothes were rumpled, and he looked like he had stayed up all night. If the sea of paper on the table was anything to go by, he'd gotten his diagrams for Earth's defense done.</p>
    <p>Jack accepted the cup and sat down at the table careful to avoid spilling. The events of the day before were high in his mind. With luck, John, Aeryn, Rhia, and Seth would be leaving today. He still couldn't believe he was letting them go so easily and so quickly. But they insisted they had to go as soon as possible. Lives were at stake. It was the right thing to do. "I guess we're going to the house first?" he asked.</p>
    <p>John looked up from whatever he was drawing. "You and the kids. Aeryn and I have to stop at Ace Hardware for some things. We'll meet at Mel's."</p>
    <p>"They know we're coming?"</p>
    <p>"Frell! I knew I'd forgotten something!" John leaped to his feet and grabbed the phone, nearly overturning half his papers.</p>
    <p>While John called, Jack decided to get some toast. Passing the door that led into the living room, he saw Aeryn asleep on the couch, also in her clothes from the day before. He'd had them what? Four months? Too short a time. Nevertheless, he understood, and that was why he wouldn't stop them, he reminded himself.</p>
    <p>Not long after John warned the girls that their presence was required at Melanie's house around seven thirty, the rest of the house woke up. Yawning, Aeryn came in and fixed the kids Fruit Loops, while John pulled his stuff together. By quarter till, he and the children were on their way across town.</p>
    <p>As he drove, Jack took particular notice of the land around them. Canaveral. Florida. Earth. He'd spent his entire life on this one planet, save for one exceptional week when he had gone to the moon. John had been on hundreds, lived in space on a ship, and was going back. It boggled the mind. At least this time they had a chance to say goodbye.</p>
    <p>No one challenged them when they reached the house. There were no reporters in the bushes, and the security people across the street were probably still asleep. Rhia and Seth were surprisingly helpful in gathering their things, and it didn't take them as long as he thought it would to fill the bags and then some. They took most of the books and toys, but left half of the clothes. John had told him to leave most of theirs as well, since they probably wouldn't wear them out there. As he packed them up, it hit Jack again that they were really leaving.</p>
    <p>Rhia and Seth seemed to have no problems saying goodbye to their house, and Jack didn't say anything about it. Seth patted the doorstep and Rhia waved, but that was it. They were little after all, and the house with its constant intrusions had probably not been a real home to them.</p>
    <p>Bags in the car, they pulled out of the dozing neighborhood. A few people were out getting their newspapers, any interest in the alien occupants of 451 long gone. As soon would be its occupants.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>As soon as Ryan opened the door, Melanie pounced. "What the hell is going on?!" she shouted at the man standing on their doorstep. Mark, Lisa, DK, who'd also been called, and all the kids crept out of the kitchen, wary of another fight.</p>
    <p>Still on the threshold, John stared at Melanie, Aeryn standing unsmiling just behind his shoulder. "We're leaving. Can we come in?"</p>
    <p>Ryan felt his jaw drop and, after a second, quickly snapped it closed. Taking his silence as a yes, John entered with Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"I know it's abrupt, but Moya's here, and they need us to go with them. We'll be gone by tonight." John led the way into the living room. Everyone, stunned, followed.</p>
    <p>"But why?" asked Ryan. He thought they had come here to get away from a war in that other galaxy. Why would they go back?</p>
    <p>"The Peacekeepers have attacked a system of planets that cannot be allowed to fall if we are going to survive the war," said Aeryn, looking him in the eye.</p>
    <p>"Is that really the reason or are you just running away from all your problems here?" DK demanded, too worked up to sit. Instead he stood, arms crossed belligerently across his chest. Ryan glanced at Melanie who was glaring at her brother. "I didn't hear anything about Moya being back."</p>
    <p>"Neither did we," John told him, meeting his gaze. "That's why they contacted us on our comms." He held up a piece of gold. "Hey, Pilot, you still there?"</p>
    <p>And to Ryan's utter surprise a voice, that in no way, shape, or form could be Human, answered. DK obviously recognized it because his arms dropped and he sat down.</p>
    <p>"They didn't tell you?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"So you're just going?" asked Mel, accusation in every part of her body.</p>
    <p>John looked away.</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry, Melanie, but we have to go," said Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"It's a good excuse to run away, isn't it?" Mel retorted bitterly. "I know it's not easy here for you, but you could at least stick it out. What good would you do against this army anyway?!"</p>
    <p>"Damnit! What good am I doing here?!" John snapped. "The government doesn't want special defenses; they're about ready to lock us up and throw away the key! As to what good I could do out there, a lot more than I can do from here!"</p>
    <p>"We're not asking your permission to go," Aeryn added quietly.</p>
    <p>Silence reigned as they all looked at each other.</p>
    <p>"We don't belong here," John finally said, taking his own turn in studying the carpet. "I don't belong here. I've changed so much that I don't know how... how to live here anymore. Maybe I needed to come back to see that."</p>
    <p>No one knew what to say. But in the end, it wasn't words that were needed when Lisa got up and pulled John into a hug. There were tears on her cheeks, Ryan noticed, and seeing them, he felt his own chest clench.</p>
    <p>"Don't go," she whispered over his shoulder.</p>
    <p>"We have to."</p>
    <p>"Then you'll come back, won't you?"</p>
    <p>"Promise."</p>
    <p>Lisa held him tight for a long while. Ryan couldn't believe it was happening so fast. Like a lightening strike, the world, or should he say universe, was changing again. When Lisa finally let him go, John laid it out: the missing friends, the occupied planet, the threat to the system, his unborn daughter. It was more than Ryan had ever heard him say about his previous life. Maybe it was because they were going that he felt he had to tell. It was almost eight thirty, time to head to work, when he and Aeryn finished. One more time, they were passed around for hugs.</p>
    <p>Melanie was the last to give her blessing. She held back, staring at the carpet. Ryan was concerned. She had just gotten over having him back, and now he was going again. He didn't know if the explanation had helped or made it worse. Finally she stood and faced John. "You know I love you, right?" she asked, her voice cracking.</p>
    <p>John hugged her and she clung to him crying in earnest now. "Yes." When they pulled apart, she turned to Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"Take care of him," she said, giving her sister-in-law a hug as well.</p>
    <p>"Always."</p>
    <p>With one final goodbye, they left.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Dan knew something was going on from the second, John handed him the papers. "Here," the former astronaut told him.</p>
    <p>"What's this?" he asked, looking at the top sketch.</p>
    <p>"Plans for the defense systems. It's probably not complete, but you should be able to figure out the rest."</p>
    <p>"Where will you be?" asked Major Fanby. Dell looked critically at the pair.</p>
    <p>Aeryn and John swapped a look, then John said. "We're running off to Vegas. You know, Aeryn's never been. It'll be fun."</p>
    <p>Their clothes were the same ones they had been wearing the day before, Dan noticed. "John, what's going on?" he demanded, setting the designs on the table behind him. Half of them slid to the floor, but he didn't care. John looked like he was about to lie again, his eyes distant and unwelcoming.</p>
    <p>"It's better if you don't know," he said.</p>
    <p>"Why? What's going on?" Dan took a step forward, getting angry now. What was with all the secrecy?</p>
    <p>But he didn't have time to find out. The door opened just then, and Giller with three of his security guards strode in. "Aeryn Sun," said Giller coldly, turning to the alien woman. "You are under arrest for assault and battery of a federal officer."</p>
    <p>"What?!" John shouted, rounding on Giller, but his goons drew their weapons, forcing John to pull up short.</p>
    <p>Giller smiled again in such a way that chills skittered through Dan's chest. What was going on? One minute John was handing him plans, the next Giller was arresting Aeryn. Everything was so out of control he could feel his heart beating.</p>
    <p>"She is after all an American citizen and subject to our laws," said Giller smugly. He turned to Aeryn. "You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law..." Giller went on, enjoying every second of it.</p>
    <p>John, however, suddenly started babbling in a language that had to be alien while one of the guards cuffed his wife. She didn't resist, and instead allowed them to take her away. As soon as they were gone, John swore. Dan was too stunned to take in more than that for the moment. He felt like he was spinning like a top. Shakily, he reached for the closest chair and lowered himself into it. Guns, an arrest, what was next?</p>
    <p>"What are you doing?" Dan looked up. Jason was staring intently at John, blocking him from the door.</p>
    <p>"Get out of my way." John stared him down. "I need to find out where they're taking her."</p>
    <p>"She's under arrest -"</p>
    <p>"For shoving Giller out of our way when he tried to stop us from leaving yesterday!" John snapped. "If I'm going to get her out of here before that Doc McPhearson gets his hands on her, I need to know where she'd being held!" He tried to push past Jason but the Commander stood his ground. John fought but they were too close to each other for anything to be effective. O'Reilly and Worthel jumped in to help Jason.</p>
    <p>"Calm down!" shouted the Commander. It took almost ten minutes for the three of them to wrestle John to the ground, and none of them came out of it unscathed. "Just calm down will you? You can get Aeryn out on bail."</p>
    <p>"No, she'll be locked up by then, and they'll never let her out. I promised I wouldn't let that happen to her!" John continued to struggle.</p>
    <p>"Could one of us go find out?" Dan suddenly said. "Would that make you feel better?"</p>
    <p>"I'll go," Kiwi volunteered, eyes too bright as she watched the scene before her.</p>
    <p>"Me too," added Maria hastily, unnerved by the scene. "We'll find out where she is and go tell Reginard."</p>
    <p>"Can we compromise without breaking any more bones?" asked Jason from his position on top of John's legs.</p>
    <p>"Fine. Call me as soon as you know where she is." John sighed and let his head fall back against the floor with a thud. "Okay, I won't fight." Cautiously, the three men let him up. He stood and, true to his word, went for a chair instead of the door. Kiwi and Maria were already gone. They all looked at each other in silence, nervous and confused.</p>
    <p>"What's going on, John?" asked Diana, the Navy officer. "You can trust us. We want to help." The former astronaut glanced at her but remained silent, turning instead to stare pensively at the door.</p>
    <p>Dan wished someone would say something soon to break the oppressive silence, but no one budged, waiting for John to explain. After what seemed like forever, but what couldn't have been more than a minute, John lifted his head and met their stares.</p>
    <p>"Will you help me get out of here?" he asked. "Help me get Aeryn out and steal my module back?"</p>
    <p>"What are you talking about?" asked Jason. "Leave to where? You'll be hunted down."</p>
    <p>"Moya."</p>
    <p>Oh. Dan couldn't think farther than that. He was a scientist and didn't know much about this action movie stuff. "Moya's not talking to us," he said blankly. "And the Farscape is in pieces." John had to know that, he's the one who had helped take it apart.</p>
    <p>"That's why I need your help," said John. "I have to rescue Aeryn and I won't have time to put the module back together once I break her loose."</p>
    <p>"And you want us to do that for you," Dan nodded, catching on.</p>
    <p>"Wait a minute. You're talking about leaving Earth on *Moya*?" asked Worthel. He shook his head in disbelief. "You can't leave Earth."</p>
    <p>"Look, I know you don't like it, but I have to go. My friends up there need our help. Down here, Aeryn is going to be given to that psycho doctor and I will not allow that to happen! Now either you help me, or I go on to plan C which will probably get people killed, and that is something none of us want." John was on his feet, now, glaring at them.</p>
    <p>"What doctor?" Peter dared to ask.</p>
    <p>"Doctor George McPhearson, head of the new xenobiology unit at Andrews Naval Base." Everyone turned to the door where a slim, black haired woman stood in a Navy dress uniform, with DK by her side. Dan felt his grasp on cohesive thought slip again. What was going on? "Major Laurie Martin, Navy Medicine," the woman introduced herself. "I'm also an old friend of DK's." She entered and handed a slip of paper to John. "My latest orders. It means someone is going to be brought in today."</p>
    <p>Dan watched John read the orders, his face closing off the farther he got. When he looked up, he asked, "When?"</p>
    <p>"Fourteen hundred hours," Major Martin informed him.</p>
    <p>"Then we don't have much time." John handed the paper to Jason who read it aloud. The contents were enough to make Dan wish he hadn't eaten breakfast, and by the end, every person in the room was willing to help.</p>
    <p>"So what's the plan?" he asked, turning back to Crichton.</p>
    <p>John closed his eyes a second then reopened them. "First we have to get my module space worthy. Dan, can you and DK do that. Grab whomever you need. The rest of us will get Aeryn out. That'll take two steps: springing her and hiding us until the module's ready."</p>
    <p>They didn't waste much time with fancy stuff, and within ten minutes, Dan was out the door with DK, Peter, and Major Fanby. Maria would join them as soon as soon as she and Kiwi got back. When they arrived at the hangar that housed the Farscape I, and saw the condition the poor ship was in, Dan realized that the plan was absolutely insane.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Thank you, sir...No, still nothing from them...Yes, sir. Goodbye." Reginard hung up the phone. He was going to kill Giller. The pain in the ass was out for blood and causing a whole lot of trouble. If Ms. Taylor and Ms. Pellam hadn't come in asking questions, Giller probably wouldn't have bothered to tell him he had arrested Aeryn Sun. As it was, he had only managed to force Giller to keep her on IASA grounds - she was under guard in a third floor conference room - until he could sort this mess out with the higher ups. Reginard had a headache.</p>
    <p>The good news was that it was almost lunchtime, and he could take a five-minute break. He would have to remind Giller to feed Aeryn. Maybe he'd send his secretary with something. He was making the note, when the door to his office was almost knocked in.</p>
    <p>It was Crichton. Reginard was surprised the man hadn't shown up earlier. There was a bruise forming on his chin, and in general, he looked a little worse for wear. And definitely not happy.</p>
    <p>"I know she's in the building, but no one can go upstairs. Where is she?" John got straight to the point.</p>
    <p>"If you're planning on breaking her out, don't bother. Giller is guarding her well with his own men. I'm working on getting him to let her go. She'll be out of here by five." Reginard looked earnestly into John's worried eyes, hoping he still had his trust. He was doing his best, and he would get her away from Giller legally, John just had to trust him.</p>
    <p>Finally, Crichton nodded. "At least tell me she'd not locked in some broom closet," he asked, glancing out the window then back.</p>
    <p>Reginard smiled, glad he could reassure him of that. "She's fine, in a conference room."</p>
    <p>"Okay. Thanks." John turned to go, but before he reached the door, he stopped and turned back. "It was nice working with you, Ambassador Reginard. Good luck." He left.</p>
    <p>He had used his name. His title and his name. Taken aback and not sure what to make of it, Reginard went to the vending machine for lunch. Hitting the button for a ham and cheese sandwich, he decided not to worry about it until Giller had been taken care of. Now that was something to worry about that wouldn't just go away.</p>
    <p>But all thought of Giller did fly out of his mind when the janitor's closet exploded just thirty feet in front of him. And then another and another. Flames leapt from the blown open doors like whips, spreading across the floor. Reginard ran to the fire alarm and pulled down the handle just as the sprinklers turned on. Smoke everywhere, he ran for the doors with a hundred other people who came pouring out of offices, shrieking in fear.</p>
    <p>The chaos outside was absolute. Through the panicked crowd and the din, he heard someone shout, "The prisoner!" but he couldn't make out any more. Everything was too confused, too wild, and out of control. What the hell had happened?! Fifteen more feet and it would have been him in front of the explosion from the janitor's closet. The broom closet, he realized. John had done this. To get Aeryn.</p>
    <p>Reginard looked around wildly, but saw nothing except scared people. The fire sirens from the approaching trucks contrasted with the astonished silence of the onlookers and escapees. The building didn't burn so much as smoke, thick and dark clouds swelling upward like storm clouds rising.</p>
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>
    <p>The whole complex was in an uproar by the time DK got back to his office in the Shepherd building. The fire in the administration building had upset the day, and now security and police were everywhere looking for John and Aeryn. The word was Aeryn had been arrested for murder, and John had started the fire. Some even said John had also killed Giller because he had arrested Aeryn. DK knew that was an exaggeration. Even the John he had come to know over the last four months wouldn't kill the man if he could help it.</p>
    <p>Nodding to Yora and Kiwi who were keeping watch, DK entered his office where John and Aeryn were avoiding security. So far they hadn't come here, but it was only a matter of time. The security cameras in the hall were intact but looped, keeping goings and comings a secret. "She's ready," he said. "Just the way you brought her back."</p>
    <p>"Thank you," said John.</p>
    <p>It was time for them to leave before the authorities thought to look here. "You're still going?" DK asked before he could stop himself.</p>
    <p>"DK -"</p>
    <p>"I know, I know. Yes. Of course, you can't stay now. I still wish you would."</p>
    <p>"Look, I know we never really talked about what happened to me, and I'm sorry about the wormhole thing..."</p>
    <p>"John," DK interrupted. His old friend looked at him, his eyes once again expressing the love and fear that seemed to get lost in words. "I'll take care of the wormhole research. At least with me at the helm, I can falsify it. But that doesn't matter, now. State function right?" he tried to smile past the lump in his throat. This was not the time. He knew it, but if not now, when? "What matters it that I love you, and I've had you for four months, and I know you're alive. When you're out there, just take care of your family, or I'll run off with Aeryn myself." This time the smile, and the matching ones on John and Aeryn's faces, came more easily.</p>
    <p>"Thanks. I'm gonna miss you, too."</p>
    <p>"Likewise, bro." They regarded each other a moment, then John grabbed him into a fierce hug that said everything else that needed saying. He was leaving, thought DK.</p>
    <p>"Are you two ready?" asked Aeryn quietly when they broke apart. They nodded as one. DK felt calm as one did before the storm. The plan was simple, and if all went well there would be no more explosions. That was plan C, John had explained to them when they were setting it up. The small army of engineers, astronauts, and the five military officers on the technology team helping John and Aeryn escape would distract security by shouting John or Aeryn's names at various places away from the hangar that held the Farscape I. DK only hoped that it worked.</p>
    <p>"Good luck," he said. "And take care of yourselves." He pulled Aeryn close in a brief hug that she returned.</p>
    <p>"You too," she whispered fiercely.</p>
    <p>DK left the office alone and said to the waiting ladies, "It's time." Each taking their own steadying breath, they split up, to start the diversion. DK went to the north end of the building and rode the elevator down. The numbers passed slowly like his own personal countdown. When the doors opened he took a deep breath. This was it.</p>
    <p>On the ground floor, two security officers were knocking on doors. DK casually went out the double doors, and once he was far enough away but still close enough to be heard inside, he yelled, "John!"</p>
    <p>It worked like a charm. Out came security, demanding where their prey was and what direction he had taken. DK pointed directly opposite the hangars. The guards took off, calling for backup. Soon, the chaos that had been present since the fire, transformed into pandemonium with mixed messages coming over the wires, confusing the hell out of security and the police. If it hadn't been so nerve wracking, it would have been fun. At one point, DK crossed paths with Captain O'Reilly, and with conspiratory grins, they took off in different directions. The game lasted about ten minutes before the guards figured out that something was fishy. DK prayed it was enough.</p>
    <p>He was dodging around the back of the Braun building when two of Giller's security people cornered him. "Seen Crichton, have you?" one of the big, beefy men sneered.</p>
    <p>At that moment, the sound of engines roaring to life nearby echoed through the complex. DK smiled in relief. They'd done it. "Nope. Just heard him," he said cheerfully. The two guards stared at him for a second, then looked at each other, then, forgetting about DK, followed the engine noise toward the field that neighbored the runway, where the rest of IASA had turned out to look.</p>
    <p>John and Aeryn were air born. They did a flyby at the control tower then left for the lake where Jack was waiting with Rhia and Seth. By the time the military scrambled to catch them, it would be too late.</p>
    <p>Within thirty seconds, they were gone, hidden by the distant tree line. DK turned back to the IASA complex, alone among the crowd of hundreds of shocked personnel. Around them he heard gasps of surprise and speculation if it was all related. The press would do a story on today's event, maybe even a serial on Earth's first encounter with aliens from start to finish, he thought flippantly. They were already lining up to grab anyone who would interview. Yep, it would be in the history books, thought DK brightly, for some reason in a good mood, and the details would fade into legend.</p>
    <p>But that didn't matter because he knew the truth. He paused and pulled out his wallet and the picture he'd added to it after Christmas. It was of John and Aeryn sitting on their couch, grinning at the camera, arms wrapped around Rhia and Seth who giggled in delight in their laps. In the foreground there were wisps of wrapping paper and opened presents. Just his best friend and his family, relaxed and happy for a moment in time. That was the truth that DK would always remember.</p>

    Section 13: Equations<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>It was both amazing and frustrating, in Sam's opinion. The banners of equations that draped across the room like a really big toilet papering were first of all not in any coherent order, and secondly, only half written in symbols she understood. She was trying to decide if that really bothered her though. Because what she could read was enough to make her head spin.</p>
    <p>From what she gathered, it was wormhole theory, but wormhole theory expanded well beyond Sam's research, most notably in how the fourth dimension was taken into consideration. Time, in Sam's experience, was fairly constant. The standard hours passed the same on Earth as they did on other planets even if they did not correspond to the planets' rotation or orbit. In short, gate travel was simply a physical dislocation.</p>
    <p>But on the butcher paper scattered everywhere, the temporal variable was not constant. Einstein would have a field day with this.</p>
    <p>"Major Carter, are you alright?" Teal'c's calm voice broke through Sam's thoughts.</p>
    <p>"What? Oh. Yes. Fine." She glanced at him curiously, wondering why he had asked.</p>
    <p>"You have not moved for some time," he answered her silent query.</p>
    <p>"Sorry." Sam grinned wryly. "It's just that this has given me a lot to think about. What I've read, or can read at all, doesn't contradict what we've learned about wormholes, but it certainly takes it to new levels. Crichton said that he thought the stargate acted as a navigational control for a wormhole that kept us in the right time. I'm wondering if what happened when we went back to 1969 wasn't just the solar flares affecting the wormhole, but actually setting it loose from the stargate's control briefly." Sam stopped even though Teal'c seemed to be paying attention. He probably was listening, but she could tell he wasn't that interested. "Anyway, I can't wait to talk to him about it."</p>
    <p>"I'm sure you will find a way," said Teal'c. Sam grinned again and Teal'c smiled lightly back before turning his attention back to the yellow robot working in the corner. If Sam hadn't been as caught up in the treasure before her, she might have been interested too.</p>
    <p>As it was, she awkwardly shuffled the six foot paper she had been studying aside and stood up, wondering where to try next. Looking around, a ragged edge caught her eye on the opposite side of the room from Teal'c. Curious, Sam waded to it and pulled it out. It turned out to be much shorter than any of the other pages she'd seen - about two feet square. The rest of it had been burned away.</p>
    <p>"Teal'c, look at this?" Sam found a matching burned piece a few feet away and held the two pieces up for her friend to see.</p>
    <p>Teal'c looked curiously first at the pieces then at her. "Why would they destroy this particular set of equations?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"I don't know. Maybe it contained dangerous information they didn't want anyone else to find."</p>
    <p>"In that case, would not all of this have been destroyed? D'argo made it clear that wormhole knowledge was itself dangerous."</p>
    <p>Sam studied the writing at the top, but it was mostly symbols she didn't know so she didn't know what it referred to. "It was something to do with this information specifically," she murmured. "Why? What was so important it had to be destroyed?"</p>
    <p>"Not important." Sam jumped at the unexpected voice from the door. John Crichton stood there looking like he just woke up.</p>
    <p>"Not important?" she echoed, glancing back at the charred papers.</p>
    <p>"Nah, just wrong."</p>
    <p>"And for this you burned the incorrect information?" Teal'c raised a disbelieving eyebrow.</p>
    <p>Crichton rubbed his chin absently, looking around at all the scattered equations. "Well, shot it actually." Off their looks he added, "I was a little stressed."</p>
    <p>"Really." Sam couldn't help the amused smile from cracking over her face. He sounded just like the Colonel. "Ever heard of an eraser?"</p>
    <p>Crichton grinned back. "Not out here. Anyway, there wasn't time. So Jack said you were a theoretical astrophysicist."</p>
    <p>"Yeah," said Sam happily. "And you? I mean you wrote this stuff. . . "</p>
    <p>"Theoretical sciences and cosmic theory." Crichton shrugged like it wasn't anything to be proud of.</p>
    <p>Sam liked his modesty but pushed on anyway. "Can I ask you about these equations? I understand some of it from my work with the stargate wormholes but there's a lot of alien symbols that I don't know - " She stopped rambling as Crichton just stared at her with his own amused smile shaking his head.</p>
    <p>"I don't understand most of it either," he said into the quiet.</p>
    <p>"But - "</p>
    <p>"It's in my head. I wrote it so I could see it, figure it out. Master it." He paused, his gaze lingering over the messy room. "Wormholes are . . . deadly," he said sadly, the smile gone. "I should burn the rest of this."</p>
    <p>"But you can't," Sam protested, shocked at the thought. She had the sudden urge to protect this treasure trove. "There's so much we could learn. You can't destroy it. It's too important."</p>
    <p>"And that's why I have to," Crichton countered. He laughed hollowly. "You don't get it do you? Wormholes . . ." He paused, searching the ceiling for words. "I have . . . power over the universe. I can destroy a star. . . hell, a solar system if I wanted to." He looked directly at Sam. "And trust me when I tell you there are Hitlers out here that will stop at nothing to be able to blow everyone to kingdom come." His voice was hash, bitter even. Sam resisted the urge to step back away from him. "Enough people have died," said Crichton softly. He looked away from her and Teal'c.</p>
    <p>"So what about us?" asked Sam. "How do we get back to our reality without this?"</p>
    <p>"I'll help you get back if I can," Crichton glanced up. "I doubt I could teach you anyway - I use it mostly by instinct. But don't get your hopes up. We'll either have to do something to your stargate without getting killed by the fridge-faces or find another wild wormhole."</p>
    <p>"Do you not have knowledge of any local wormholes?" asked Teal'c.</p>
    <p>Crichton didn't look at them; instead he turned toward the door. "Not anymore," was all he said.</p>
    <p>"Why not?" asked Sam.</p>
    <p>He kept walking but said, " 'Cause we collapsed it." Sam exchanged a shocked look with Teal'c, feeling once again out of her depth. "Come on," said Crichton. "It's supper time."</p>

  content: <p>&ldquo;Uh oh. Gibbs. Head&rsquo;s up.&rdquo; Tony was the first to see Fornell and his two current flunkies stride off the elevator towards them with a little black thundercloud over their heads. Well, there would have been one if this was a cartoon. Gibbs stood to meet them head-on, coming around his desk as Fornell rounded the cubicle wall.<br /><br />&ldquo;Gibbs.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Fornell.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You want to tell me why you waited three days to notify the Bureau that you had the Winchesters in your grasp and you let them go?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;By the time we realized who they were, they were long gone,&rdquo; Gibbs replied.<br /><br />&ldquo;So you just contacted two very dangerous criminals by accident.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;We were following up on a lead, and they turned up. They made us before we made them and refused to show up for a second meet.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;For a computer problem.&rdquo;  Fornell had obviously read the report.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gibbs easily, and with no intention of explaining further.<br /><br />&ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo;  Fornell clearly didn&rsquo;t buy it.  &ldquo;Conference room?&rdquo;<br /><br />Gibbs gestured back the way he&rsquo;d come.  &ldquo;After you.&rdquo;<br /><br />As Gibbs and Fornell disappeared into the elevator, Tony and Kate both crossed their arms and stared down the remaining FBI agents. The taller one rolled his eyes and sat on the edge of McGee&rsquo;s desk. &ldquo;You know how many people are up in arms about this?&rdquo; asked the other one.<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Tony with an easy smile.  &ldquo;Gibbs has a knack for pissing off so many people.&rdquo;<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the elevator, Gibbs was saying, &ldquo;Tobias, have you read that case file?  It reads like Swiss cheese.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Gibbs, my hands are tied on this one. I&rsquo;m only here because someone seems to think we get along. I don&rsquo;t know the lead agent on this case, but expect him to come gunning for you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to pretend to quake in my boots.&rdquo;<br /><br />~*~<br /><br />The lead agent on the case turned out to not just be gunning for Gibbs but going for all out carpet bombing. His arrival had the homey feel of a hostile takeover.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for Gibbs,&rdquo; was the first thing he said, coming to a stop at the entrance to their bullpen, a veritable entourage of agents behind him. Tony and Kate exchanged a glance as they came around their desks to meet him, closing ranks as Tony spoke.<br /><br />&ldquo;And you would be?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Special Agent Victor Hendricksen,&rdquo; the lead agent said very precisely.  &ldquo;You Gibbs?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s out at the moment, but if you leave your number and tell me what this is about I can take a message.&rdquo; Tony smiled brightly. Hendricksen was not amused and took two menacing step forward.<br /><br />&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Working a case,&rdquo; said Kate.  Gibbs and McGee were at Quantico interviewing engineers.<br /><br />&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;  Hendricksen looked from her to Tony.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start with you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Start what?&rdquo; Gibbs&rsquo;s voice cut across the tension like a knife as he glared the other FBI agents out of his way. Hendricksen, predictably, didn&rsquo;t budge. McGee did a little dance trying to simultaneously get by to his desk and avoid the rapidly encroaching FBI agents.<br /><br />&ldquo;Questioning them on your recent encounter with Dean and Sam Winchester.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in my report,&rdquo; Gibbs replied without looking at him.  &ldquo;What do you have?&rdquo;<br /><br />Kate went first with the phone records, followed by Tony with the DMV report and the records from previous assignments. Hendricksen got in Gibbs&rsquo;s face and said loudly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you appreciate the seriousness of the situation. You had two serial killers that you let get away &ndash;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I have three dead Marines and another one missing. Don&rsquo;t tell me I don&rsquo;t understand the seriousness of this situation,&rdquo; Gibbs cut him off. &ldquo;There is nothing I can do about the Winchesters now and you are going to wait until I am finished with this case before I or any of my people answer your questions. Understood?&rdquo;<br /><br />Hendricksen actually blinked.  &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind if I wait here.&rdquo;<br /><br />~*~<br /><br />Half an hour later, Gibbs and Hendricksen were in each other&rsquo;s faces.<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting in the way of my investigation!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting in the way of mine!&rdquo;<br /><br />It was like center ring at a three ring circus; everyone on the third floor was watching.<br /><br />&ldquo;Gibbs!&rdquo; Director Morrow shouted down from on high, impatient and pissed off at the current standoff that was interrupting the conference call that had started this whole thing.<br /><br />While Gibbs had been working, Hendricksen had called his director to complain. A director that had now called Morrow to complain and apparently wanted Gibbs to explain himself personally.<br /><br />Morrow glared down at his agent and made a snap decision he had actually hoped to avoid.  &ldquo;MTAC, now.&rdquo;<br /><br />Clearly fuming, Gibbs complied, shouting orders at his people to get them back to work on the three dead and one missing Marine.<br /><br />&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he started as soon as he was within earshot.<br /><br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t cover your ass if you shoot him, Gibbs,&rdquo; Morrow said preemptively, leading the way into MTAC. &ldquo;Now sit down and cool off.&rdquo; He pointed at a seat in the back and to the side outside of the camera range. Gibbs shot him an irritated look but did as he was told for now which was all Morrow could ask for.<br /><br />He nodded to the tech to resume the call.  &ldquo;Director Groves, I apologize for the interruption,&rdquo; he said smoothly.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Groves with more than a hint of exasperation. &ldquo;I would greatly appreciate it if you would quit the stonewalling.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I assure you that I am not stonewalling you, Director.  Your Agent Hendricksen, is however impeding an ongoing investigation &ndash;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Just as your man is impeding ours. We&rsquo;re talking about serial killers here, Director,&rdquo; said Groves. &ldquo;Every second wasted is another life lost. You do not understand how fast these men move.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;And the serial killer that Agent Gibbs is investigating right now?  Are his victims any less important?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;That has &ndash;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Furthermore, if your Hendricksen has nothing better to do than waste my people&rsquo;s time while they have actual leads to follow up on, then he can wait until this case is closed to ask his questions.&rdquo; Groves clenched his jaw but didn&rsquo;t say anything right away. &ldquo;I want him gone, Director Groves,&rdquo; said Morrow. &ldquo;He has half an hour before I let Gibbs arrest him for obstruction.&rdquo;<br /><br />He nodded for the connection to be cut and turned to Gibbs who was smiling.<br /><br />&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; he said.<br /><br />&ldquo;Find that Marine,&rdquo; Morrow told him, but he smiled anyway.<br /><br />~*~<br /><br />Two days later, their Marine was found and Hendricksen was back since Gibbs refused to let his people be dragged off to the Hoover building for questioning.<br /><br />&ldquo;Haunted,&rdquo; Hendricksen repeated.<br /><br />&ldquo;Haunted.&rdquo; Abby tilted her head and gave him a stare that just dared him to question her. Hendricksen clearly took a moment to take in the pigtails, black lipstick, tattoo, and head to toe black Abby was wearing that day.<br /><br />Without a word, Hendricksen got up and left the room. He stabbed a finger in Gibbs&rsquo;s face who was standing just outside the door. &ldquo;You expect me to believe this crap?!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It was in the report,&rdquo; Gibbs shrugged, enjoying the throbbing at Hendricksen&rsquo;s temple a little too much. The report actually was better worded than that, but &ldquo;inexplicable coding aberrations,&rdquo; still didn&rsquo;t explain much.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you can get away with this, Gibbs.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d had two hours of frustrating interviews that circled around weird shenanigans that were too outrageous to believe. That and every single one of Gibbs&rsquo;s people told the same story with a straight and smiling face, and Hendricksen was ready to shoot someone himself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve destroyed evidence, falsified reports, and all you have to show for it is a stick figure cartoon a five year old could draw.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;We think it was Dean Winchester actually,&rdquo; said Gibbs helpfully. The finger closed into a fist. Hendricksen took a deep breath.<br /><br />&ldquo;You have a one hour reprieve. When I get back, you better have answers or I am slapping you and all you&rsquo;re pretty little people with obstruction. Understand?&rdquo;<br /><br />Gibbs smirked and rolled his eyes because if Hendricksen thought that NCIS hadn&rsquo;t already put them through the wringer on this one he was sadly mistaken. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the door hit you on the way out.&rdquo;<br /><br />~*~<br /><br />Hendricksen ended up not coming back. &ldquo;The Winchesters surfaced again in Albuquerque,&rdquo; said Fornell by way of both greeting and explanation when he turned up an hour later. &ldquo;Called us themselves, of all things.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Imagine that,&rdquo; said Gibbs blandly. Tony and Kate exchanged a look, then both their eyes darted quickly to Abby who was sitting on McGee&rsquo;s desk where he was looking at her with similarly raised eyebrows.<br /><br />&ldquo;Amazing coincidence,&rdquo; Fornell returned just as dryly. &ldquo;I got those files you wanted. Hendricksen&rsquo;s done some good work with the Bureau.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Until now,&rdquo; said Gibbs.  <br /><br />Fornell smiled instead of answering.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break him,&rdquo; he said.<br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; piped up Abby with a grin.  &ldquo;Gibbs is just going to show him the error of his ways.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Uh huh. You owe me.&rdquo; Gibbs just raised an eyebrow at that, until Fornell said, &ldquo;Fine, we&rsquo;re even. More even. Stop screwing around with FBI cases.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that as soon as you stop screwing them up,&rdquo; said Tony, but Fornell ignored him and left with a swirl of his trench coat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;d be happy that we&rsquo;re helping them.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;m glad they did screw this one up,&rdquo; said Kate.<br /><br />&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; said Abby, standing up.  &ldquo;Sam says &lsquo;hi,&rsquo; by the way.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;How are they doing?&rdquo; Kate asked as Abby hooked their arms together and started leading her toward the elevator.<br /><br />&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good.  Apparently they&rsquo;re looking into a demonic rabbit problem.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;That sounds . . . terrifying.&rdquo;<br /><br />~*~<br />The End</p>

    <p>Wow! Thanks for all the support out there! It really means a lot. I've never gotten this many reviews for one chapter before. I'll just warn you now that I wrote the first bit by accident, so we'll see how updates go.</p>\n\
    <p>Thanks to DonSample for pointing out Xander's mother's name. I went back and fixed that and a few other things in part one.</p>\n\
    <hr>Second Time Through<hr>Xander stared at the closed door, listening as Jack's car started up and drove off. It all felt so surreal, like he was watching someone else's life. Because how could this be happening?<p>With a sigh, Xander turned and headed out back to check on the girls in the yard. They were talking and laughing as Vi led them through their stretches, the novelty of their calling not yet worn away. Xander let them be and went inside, back upstairs to his room. His unfinished email to Willow was still on the screen where he had left it. He'd have to rewrite it now, he thought. Add that his parents were dead.</p>\n\
    <p>Turning away from the computer, he sat instead on his bed, elbows on knees as he gazed at the pictures Jack had given him. He had lost all his pictures when they closed the Hellmouth, not that he'd had many of his parents.</p>\n\
    <p>Dead. His parents were dead. He felt his eye prick and a tear slide down his cheek. They were gone. It was one thing to look at the carnage from the riots and guess, another to hear the words that cemented it into reality. His mom had been so beautiful. Young, free. She couldn't have been much older in the picture than Xander was now, but he had never felt as young as she looked. At least not in a long, long time. And she was gone now. Like Anya. And as much as he had sometimes hated his parents, he wanted nothing more than to see them one last time. But he couldn't. Xander's head fell into his hands and silent sobs accompanied the pictures falling to the floor.</p>\n\
    <p>He didn't know how long he sat there, but after a while he felt someone sit on the bed next to him and an arm snake around his waist. Sighing he sat up and hugged Dawn back, glad of the simple comfort she offered. Neither of them said anything; they didn't have to.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry about your parents,\" Dawn said softly after a while.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander let out a soft, sad huff of air and wiped the tears from his cheeks. \"Yeah. I never would have thought I'd be crying over them.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"They were still your parents,\" Dawn replied. Xander caught the note of longing in her voice. Their dad still hadn't contacted them. Not like Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And now there's this guy who says he's my real dad.\" Xander still didn't know if he believed it or not.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I googled him,\" said Dawn. \"He's who he says he is. We'll have to get Willow to do the deep dark secret search. And a paternity test if you want.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" he absently agreed, thinking back over the man who had flown from Colorado just to see him.</p>\n\
    <p>For an old guy, Jack was in shape and actually looked pretty good over all. Also not horribly out of fashion, he noted remembering the casual khakis, shirt, and leather jacket he had worn. Xander couldn't decide if that bothered him or not. Then he wondered why he was focusing on something so entirely irrelevant.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's coming back tomorrow,\" he told Dawn. \"He says he wants to get to know me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is that good?\" asked Dawn hesitantly. \"I mean, do you really think he's your dad?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shrugged not wanting to think about it but unable not to. He'd lost his original birth certificate with everything else in Sunnydale. Regardless, having someone else call him son wasn't really going to change anything. Dad hadn't really been his dad since high school anyway. \"He thinks so. Said I looked like his uncle.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What did you talk about?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing really. I asked about his family, he asked if I had a girlfriend.\" But she was gone too. \"He asked about my eye.\" Dawn nodded and silence settled over them again.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander wondered where this was going to go. He wondered why he had told Jack he could come back. With his current luck he would probably turn out to be another demon trying to get to them through him. His eye found the pictures on the floor. Mom and Jack. Jack and Mom. \"Are they really real?\" he half-whispered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow's all-purpose truth spell came up positive.\"</p>\n\
    <p>So maybe not a demon. He hadn't even gotten to the Colonel thing yet. Those were scabs best left alone for now.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Can I come with you to pick up Buffy and Giles?\" asked Dawn, breaking the quiet.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" he turned and smiled at her, for real this time. \"Thanks. I could use the company.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Anytime.\" And they both knew it was about more than a ride to the airport. Dawn gave him a final squeeze then left to get back to whatever translation she was working on for Giles. Xander stared after her for a minute before going back to the email to Willow who was somewhere on the East Coast. He deleted the last few lines then started a new paragraph.</p>\n\
    <hr>The next day after overseeing the usual chaos that was cooking for and feeding over thirty slayers and making sure the veterans had the newbies under control, Xander and Dawn headed for the airport with Dawn in the driver's seat. They hadn't told Buffy yet that she'd gotten her license, deciding that what she didn't know wouldn't hurt her. She'd become better about letting Dawn grow up but still had the tendency to be overprotective. So when she was gone, Xander let Dawn drive. And if she found out he had his lack of depth perception as an excuse.<p>The airport was noisy but not too crowded. They waited in the baggage claim area passing the time by filling in the words to other peoples conversations as they greeted each other. It was nice to just sit and people-watch with Dawn, see how the other side lived. Xander hadn't done this since working construction.</p>\n\
    <p>They had been waiting for about twenty minutes when two familiar figures finally came down the escalator. Beside him, Dawn shrieked and bounded over to tackle her sister and Giles, Xander trailing in her wake. Having just come from London, they both looked tired and unkempt, but happy to be back. Giles smiled at him and gave him a hug when he reached them. Dawn was already chattering a mile a minute at Buffy with no sign of stopping, so Xander took his life into his own hands and commandeered the slayer for a hug, which she laughingly returned. Dawn's commentary on life at the house never stopped.</p>\n\
    <p>By the time they got their bags and were on the way home Dawn had caught them up since their last phone call four days ago. While the news about Xander's parents didn't surprised them, the news about his possible father did. But Dawn, bless her, wouldn't let them ask questions, saying they could get the details after they got home. She wanted to hear about London while she had them to herself. So they pushed aside talk of Jack in favor of making fun of the Land of Tweed. Even Giles had a thing or two to say about British drivers.</p>\n\
    <p>As far as work went, the rebuilding of the Council was progressing slowly, but progressing nonetheless. Though Xander got the impression that Buffy had spent most of their time dragging Giles to see the sights. She looked good. She looked like she'd finally had some badly needed rest.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander smiled as he watched the girls go on in the back seat about all the crazy things Buffy had tried in order to get the guards at Buckingham Palace to quit their statue routine. Beside him, Giles shook his head, silently denying any part in the escapade. Just like normal. It was good to have everyone home.</p>\n\
    <hr>At precisely four o'clock, Jack rang the doorbell to the nice, old house where Xander lived with a bunch of girls. It was simply too odd to contemplate at the moment, so Jack wisely chose not to as he listened to the stampede heading for the door. This time two brunettes, a blond, and one faded blue met him cheerfully at the door.<p>\"Hi,\" Jack smiled more sure of himself today.</p>\n\
    <p>The girls giggled and said, \"Hi, Jack,\" as they let him in.</p>\n\
    <p>\"XANDER!!!\" two of them shouted together, this time toward the back of the house, and once again Jack winced at the noise. He figured it wasn't often quiet around here.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander emerged from the back hallway followed by another, much older man. He had gray hair and glasses and wore a blue pullover, managing to look both casual and distinguished at the same time. Jack wondered who he was, maybe a parent dropping off his daughter?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey!\" another girl shouted from the kitchen. \"Buffy says break's over,\" she called to the teenagers who had let him in. With a chorus of disappointed 'awe's, the four reluctantly retreated casting wishful looks over their shoulders.</p>\n\
    <p>\"They never give up,\" said Xander by way of greeting, watching the girls leave. \"Of course I don't blame 'em for wanting to avoid Buffy.\" He turned back to Jack and the parent who hadn't left yet. \"So Jack, this is Rupert Giles. He's helping us out for the summer. Giles, Jack O'Neill.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"A pleasure to meet you,\" said Mr. Giles in a soft British accent.</p>\n\
    <p>To say Jack was surprised would have been a gross understatement. This was Giles? Xander's friend that he was running this place with? He had expected Giles to be some dumb kid, another refugee from Sunnydale with no money and a stupid idea. One old man, one young one and thirty teenage girls did not paint a pretty picture. And he was British! Just what had this guy gotten his son wrapped up in?</p>\n\
    <p>Hiding his surprise and suspicion with a neutral smile, Jack shook the offered hand. Mr. Giles had a firm handshake that almost hurt, but his mild expression suggested he wasn't aware of it. \"Would you like something to drink? Tea? Coffee?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, coffee would be great,\" said Jack, the civil custom bringing him up short and reminding him of his manners. This was Xander's 'friend' after all, good or not, and for once he didn't want to pick a fight.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander disappeared into the kitchen to get the drinks while Mr. Giles led Jack into the sitting room. Mr. Giles didn't say anything to him, instead seeming to prefer to let Jack make the first move. It was all very uncomfortable. Jack wasn't quite sure what was going on but he wanted to find out. Now.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So how do you know Xander?\" he asked as innocuously as possible.</p>\n\
    <p>Mr. Giles didn't flinch. \"I've known him since he was in high school. Yourself?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I, uh.\" Suddenly thrown on the defensive when he knew Mr. Giles was aware of who he was made Jack take a strong dislike to the man. He was being tested and he really didn't like it. \"I'm his father. His biological father anyway. But you knew that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know that's what you claim,\" Mr. Giles met his challenging gaze. \"A birth certificate and a picture are hardly concluding evidence.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander seems to think so.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Does he?\" Mr. Giles lifted a skeptical eyebrow. And suddenly Jack wasn't sure. Yesterday, after Dawn had confirmed the birth certificate they had talked . . . it hadn't been the most stellar conversation he'd ever had, but he thought they had made progress.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It was in his mother's will,\" said Jack, needing something solid to hold onto. He remembered reading it. \"I didn't find out until they called me about it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Again, all we have is your word on that,\" Mr. Giles replied. \"But I suppose that is neither here nor there at the moment since it can easily be cleared up at the hospital.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You know, your DNA, my DNA. Seeing if it's all happy little DNA,\" said Xander joining them with the drinks. \"It's not that we don't trust you, it's just that, well . . . we don't.\" He handed Jack a Snoopy mug. \"Milk or sugar?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shook his head, sighed and pushed the hurt away. To be honest he had anticipated doing a paternity test sometime. He just didn't know if he could handle it if it came out negative. He watched as Xander handed Mr. Giles a Kiss the Librarian mug and settled beside him on the couch with his own that said 'We heart Snow'.</p>\n\
    <p>His son, because he knew he was, looked better today, more relaxed than yesterday to be sure. And he looked comfortable sitting next to Mr. Giles, which rankled Jack a bit because it wasn't him. Who was this guy anyway? And what was he doing here? How did he know Xander? Yesterday's challenge of impressing the friends wasn't so fun anymore when confronted with this man.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So when do you want to do the test?\" he asked. \"I've got to get back tomorrow.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I already set up an appointment at the clinic in town in the morning,\" said Xander. \"And it wasn't easy getting a spot on such short notice.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh.\" Jack wasn't sure what to say to that. \"That's good.\" And awfully fast. Jack tried not to think about what would happen if it came back negative. He'd been dreaming of this meeting for six months. Of course the reality of it was far from anything he had expected, but at least there was still hope.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So,\" said Mr. Giles. \"You work at NORAD, Colonel?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack glanced up sharply at the man, wondering just why he asked that. He'd never said anything about where he worked yesterday. And he didn't like that look of mild curiosity either. \"And you teach teenaged girls . . . self defense?\" he shot back, letting him know exactly what he thought of the situation.</p>\n\
    <p>To his surprise, Mr. Giles actually blushed. \"Yes, actually,\" he sputtered. \"It's not what you're implying.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wasn't implying anything,\" Jack denied, happy he'd finally scored a hit. \"Just wondering what you've got my son doing here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey! Why should you care?\" Xander snapped. \"You don't live here. And even if you are my biological father, so what? You haven't been a part of my life. You don't know the first thing about us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wasn't there because I didn't know about you. I'm here now,\" said Jack a little too desperately. This wasn't happening, was it? \"I want to get to know you. Why do you think I came here?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know!\" Xander suddenly shouted back. \"You just showed up, all 'Luke I am your father' and you're not like him and I don't even know you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" Mr. Giles put a calming hand on the young man's shoulder while Jack looked on in shock. Did that even make sense? \"Xander, why don't you go check on Andrew in the kitchen,\" said Mr. Giles.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander ignored him. \"What, you tell me my parents are dead and expect to take their place protecting me? I'm not a kid.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm not expecting anything!\" Jack yelled back, feeling like he'd been kicked in the teeth. He's was going to lose him! The thought seared through his mind like fire, burning so deep it was all he could think of.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" Mr. Giles repeated sharply.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah. Fine, whatever.\" Without sparing a glance for Jack, his son stormed out of the room leaving Jack with the older man. Mildness replaced by ruthless hostility.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack scrubbed a hand over his face. Shit. This wasn't going right. \"Look, I'm sorry,\" he said not quite sure what had just happened. \"Whatever I said \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I daresay you called me a pervert,\" Mr. Giles interrupted coldly.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack bristled. \"I \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't want to hear it,\" Mr. Giles cut him off again. \"You want to make sure he's all right, I can see that. You can say anything you want to about me; I honestly don't care, but I highly doubt that insulting his friends will garner you his good will, however well intentioned.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry,\" Jack repeated with a sigh. \"I'll admit I'm probably jumping to conclusions, but frankly I don't like you,\" he bit out. \"Whatever you're doing here doesn't look good from where I'm sitting. I know it's a little late, but I just want what's best for him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"As do I Colonel O'Neill,\" said Mr. Giles. \"Even if that means getting rid of you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack caught his breath. He must have heard wrong. \"Did you just threaten me?\" he asked, eyebrows lifted at the audacity. Mr. Giles continued to calmly stare him down.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll leave the threats to the girls. They have a much more colorful way of putting things,\" said Mr. Giles, and Jack knew he wasn't talking about the girls he'd met yesterday. \"But let me make one thing perfectly clear: neither your rank nor your government will be able to protect you from me if you have one ill thought toward Xander.\" Now Jack was used to being threatened, in fact he often felt that in his old age he was getting rather immune to it. But at the moment he got the feeling that he was treading on very thin ice. Mr. Giles's tone was clear, crisp, and deadly, his accent only chilling Jack more as eyes full of mortal promise bored into him.</p>\n\
    <p>Whatever he had thought before about Mr. Giles being mild mannered when right out the window. \"You have my word,\" Jack murmured seriously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good.\" And like that, the spell was broken so quickly Jack wondered if it had really happened. \"Then you can stay for supper.\" Mr. Giles smiled at him with only a hint of his earlier menace and took a sip of his tea. \"So, Colonel, how do you like Cleveland?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack tried to smile back and hoped he would make it out of this conversation intact.</p>\n\
    <hr>The constant sound of knife against cutting board pounded like the blood through Xander's head. He could feel Andrew watching him from across the island counter and wished he could say something reassuring but he didn't know what. Hell, he couldn't even sort out why he was mad. Yesterday Jack had been okay and today he and Giles were at each other's throats.<p>Xander cleared the chopped carrots into the waiting pot and grabbed another handful. Something about Jack scared him. He was so . . . certain about being his dad. And he cared. And Xander didn't know how to handle that, not from some stranger he met yesterday who was fifty years old and in the damn army.</p>\n\
    <p>But there was a niggling voice in the back of mind whispering \"what if . . .\" What if Mom had told Jack? What if he stuck around like he said he would have? As a kid in middle school, when things had really started to go downhill in the Harris household, Xander had sometimes imagined having different parents. Parents who didn't drink, didn't yell at him, and didn't make him want to sleep outside on Christmas Eve.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander dumped the carrots in with the others, grabbing the last handful, but his hands were shaking so badly now, he cut his finger, red blood spilling over and clashing with the orange to make a nice vampire rabbit snack. His blood, Jack's blood. They'd find out tomorrow. They still didn't know for sure. Would Jack still care even if he wasn't his father?</p>\n\
    <p>Taking the carrots with him to the sink, Xander ran cold water over the wound and ignored Andrew's fussing as the blood washed away. It didn't matter. Blood didn't make you family, it only gave you a place to start. And Xander had a family. He didn't need someone who didn't know the first thing about him or Giles or anyone to come in making assumptions. Tomorrow they'd know for sure, then Jack would go back to his army and life would get back to normal on the Cleveland Hellmouth. Maybe he'd get a Christmas card like Buffy used to get from her dad. Whatever. It didn't matter.</p>\n\
    <hr>Jack was impressed that he and Mr. Giles had managed to find safe ground in seventies music. Granted it had taken Cleveland's weather, England's weather, Colorado's weather, and an aborted attempt at sports to get there, but they did manage to have a civilized conversation without mentioning Xander or what anyone actually did for a living. Nevertheless, Jack was relieved when the sitting room door opened and put an end to the conversation.<p>Unsurprisingly, it was a girl, a blonde this time and fairly short. She was wearing a tank top and sweat pants, obviously just having come in from a workout session.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Giles,\" she practically bubbled though her eyes never left Jack as both he and Mr. Giles stood. \"This him?\" she asked, giving him a professional once over.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, yes. Colonel, may I introduce Buffy Summers, one of our instructors here. Buffy, Jack O'Neill.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ms. Summers,\" Jack used his best smile for Xander's other friend. By the way she was eyeing him this must be one of the girls Mr. Giles had mentioned. She took his offered hand with a firm grasp, leaving a sheen of sweat behind.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you're the dad, huh?\" She didn't seem too impressed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That would be me,\" Jack affirmed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So if this pans out, you planning on becoming a fixture or is this a nice- to-meet-ya-I'm-going-off-to-Spain-with-my-secretary kinda deal?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh . . .\" Unsure just what she had asked, Jack suddenly wished Daniel were there to translate.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well?\" Her sharp gaze just sharpened even more while he stood there like an idiot.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What Buffy is asking is if you plan on being a part of Xander's life if you are indeed his father,\" Mr. Giles helped him out, though Jack swore that the two questions didn't share a word.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What he said,\" reiterated Buffy impatiently.</p>\n\
    <p>Feeling like he was caught between a rock and a hard place with one in front of him and one behind, Jack nodded. \"Yeah. If he'll let me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good,\" said Buffy taking a step closer and staring into his eyes. \"Because if you back out I'll rip off your arms, shove one down your throat and the other up your ass so you can twiddle you thumbs in your stomach. Do I make myself clear?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, yeah,\" said Jack fighting the urge to laugh in her face. She couldn't weigh more than a hundred pounds. Only the crazy intensity in her eyes kept his lips from twitching. She meant what she said, and even if she couldn't hurt him physically, he respected that she wanted to keep her friend from getting hurt.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good. I'll see you at dinner then.\" She looked past him at Mr. Giles then left as quickly as she had come.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack turned to Mr. Giles and grinned. \"That was one of the girls?\" he asked. \"I see what you mean about colorful.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, quite,\" said Mr. Giles offering a short, polite smile in return. \"I'm surprised she went easy on you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Threatening to rip my arms off was easy?\" Jack raised his eyebrows in surprise. Not that he felt very threatened. What more could she do?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, with Dawn's boyfriends, she brings a knife and threatens to make them eunuchs.\" The evil glint was back in Mr. Giles's eye, which made Jack shift uncomfortably from foot to foot, just to make sure everything was all there.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what's for dinner?\" asked Jack to change the subject to healthier matters.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You if you're not careful,\" Mr. Giles replied, picking up the mugs. \"I don't think Buffy was done with you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Great, just what I need. Another hostile woman drooling over me.\" Jack stopped short at the look Mr. Giles leveled at him. He winced. \"I did it again, didn't I?\" When would he learn to keep all those random thoughts in is head. Must be the stress.</p>\n\
    <hr>Xander was waiting for him by the back door. Jack looked a little surprised to see him there offering him a beer, but he took it nonetheless with a gentle smile and followed him outside to the back steps.<p>\"I figured you could use one after being cooped up with Giles,\" said Xander, putting his plate on his knees. It was sunset and the evening was cool. It would be dark soon. He looked up and saw Jack watching him with an unreadable expression on his face. He didn't know what he wanted to talk about, but he felt like the poor guy needed a break from the third degree.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thanks,\" Jack said without looking away. \"Listen, about earlier, I'm sorry for what I said. It was uncalled for.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The unexpected apology made Xander grin. \"Giles scared the living shit out you, didn't he?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack smiled and let out a chuckle. \"Maybe a little. I don't think he likes me too much.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Probably not,\" Xander agreed. You could be the First for all we know, he added in his head. But they had shaken hands so Xander knew he wasn't. He was putting his money on his being a demon though. It would make everything easier if he was.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So,\" Jack said into the silence that followed, as at a loss as Xander for conversation. \"Are we just going to sit here and be awkward?\" he finally asked.</p>\n\
    <p>The question made Xander smile again. \"You could go sit with Buffy. I know she's just dying to meet you.\" A grimace etched its way onto Jack's face.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We've actually already met,\" he said. \"She seems like a pleasant person \xE2\x80\x93 threatened to rip my arms off and everything.\" Jack smiled and shook his head. \"It was kind of touching actually.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dismemberment?\" asked Xander surprised by the comment.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She loves you enough to threaten me. Mr. Giles too.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander didn't know what to say to that stark observation. He knew it was true, but usually he was one of the ones dealing out the threats and not on the receiving side, or however it worked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, tomorrow we'll find out if you need to make funeral arrangement,\" he joked, but Jack only cracked a small smile. Okay, so it wasn't a great joke but damn it, he was nervous about all this too.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" hearing his name for the first time made him look up sharply at the older man, \"I meant what I said. I want to get to know you.\" Jack looked away searching for words in the darkening sky. \"I know I can't replace your parents,\" he finally said. \"But I'd like to be your friend.\" He turned back and Xander saw the pleading in his eyes that he would never say. \"Even if tomorrow doesn't work out . . . Jessica would have wanted it that way.\" And he meant it, Xander saw. He really meant it. Xander didn't know what to say. \"Xander?\" Jack was waiting for an answer, hoping, dreading.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack,\" he started then stopped. \"You're leaving tomorrow,\" Xander continued. \"Whether you're my father or not. You'll live your life, I'll live mine.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I can visit you,\" said Jack looking hurt. He really wanted to do this father-son thing, Xander realized. \"You can come visit me.\" And he wasn't going to give it up easily.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Can we get a dog, too?\" asked Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, we can get a dog,\" said Jack enthusiastically. \"Any kind you want.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So now it's bribery,\" Xander raised his eyebrows. Jack grinned.</p>\n\
    <p>\"If that's what it takes to get me a chance with you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You know, I could use a new car,\" suggested Xander, beginning to enjoy this a little.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack's eyes narrowed. \"Watch it, junior. I'm not that rich.\" Nonetheless, he seemed pleased by the suggestion. They settled into a light conversation about cars until dark fell and Xander insisted that Jack get back to his hotel. He'd ask whoever was on patrol to make sure he got there safely.</p>\n\
    <p>As he watched Jack's rental car pull away down the street he smiled quietly to himself. The dad thing still weirded him out, but maybe being friends would work.</p>"

    By Tassos<p>Author's note: Okay, I know I should have had this out about three months ago but now that I'm in school, I have no time and oh so many other distractions from writing. So now that I've caught up on sleep, I know I can't put it off any longer. Thank you all for being patient (and if you weren't, like I get when authors take forever to finish their fic - don't tell me. My sisters probably give me enough flak to make up for all of yours.) So let the denounment begin...</p>

    Epilogue</p>
    <p>*********************
    Earth: 2014</p>
    <p>*********************</p>
    <p>"Earlier today President Landers announced that negotiations for the new Arms Treaty with the Middle East were going better than expected. The cease fire called last week between US forces and Pakistan is still in effect while everyone waits for the results of the US's new Smart Bombs which will be held over the next week in Arizona. The weapons are the first to incorporate alien technology, and if successful, would give the United States the advantage. Gary Oswald reporting."</p>
    <p>Shannon got up from her perch near the news bureau, uninterested in listening to Gary's piece on the new Smart Bombs. She'd already gotten the scoop from the men who had designed them and learned that they basically did what all bombs did: namely blow things up. The alien component wasn't actually technology since everything had been made on Earth, but rather the design. Still it was the results that mattered. If the fear of the new bombs could stop the war in the Middle East, she was all for it. It was getting tiresome, both from a news standpoint and a human one.</p>
    <p>It would be too bad for the war correspondents. Mentally shrugging her shoulders, she went to the break room to get a cup of coffee.</p>
    <p>"Hey, Shannon," Henry greeted her.</p>
    <p>"Henry, what are you still doing here?"</p>
    <p>"Same thing you are, waiting to see our interview," he replied. "Took us so long to get it, I want to make sure they do it right."</p>
    <p>Shannon could only agree with him. Five minutes later, they went back into the news room where Debra was waiting to go back on the air.</p>
    <p>"Today another consequence of John Crichton's stay on Earth comes to an end: the Crichton Conspirators probationary sentence," the anchorwoman began. "The seventeen IASA personal, who helped Crichton and his alien wife leave Earth, have spent the last three years serving time by working for the government and watching their step. Shannon Lucas reporting from Cape Canaveral, Florida."</p>
    <p>"February 16th, 2011," the live monitor changed to an aerial shot of the Cape with Shannon narrating, "an explosion rocked the peaceful world of the Kennedy Space Center. Five homemade bombs went off in the administration building, starting fires in an elaborate jailbreak. In the chaos, the alien Erin Sun, who was under arrest for assaulting a federal officer, disappeared with her husband John Crichton. When the firefighters arrived, the hunt was on to the sound of many different birddogs. Seventeen engineers and astronauts, known as the Crichton Conspirators, sent authorities on a wild goose chase, giving Crichton and Sun time to steal the original Fasrscape spacecraft and escape Earth's atmosphere. The Conspirators have spent the last three years paying for their crimes by serving their country."</p>
    <p>The footage changed to a lounge where the infamous DK Moore and Dan Bemear sat with Shannon for the interview. "Both of you have served out your probationary sentence for three years. How does it feel now that it's finally over?" the reporter began.</p>
    <p>Moore shrugged. "I won't have to worry about parking tickets any more," he said.</p>
    <p>"Or speeding tickets," added Bemear with a smile.</p>
    <p>"Actually, it won't be that different," Moore continued. "The sentence required us to basically do our jobs. We were under more supervision of course, and we also reported to the Department on Defense, but over all it wasn't very different from what we've been doing for the last five years anyway."</p>
    <p>"Except with alien technology," said Shannon.</p>
    <p>Bemear smiled. "It's still science, still engineering. It's just been taken to a whole new level."</p>
    <p>"What were the original charges brought against you after you helped Crichton and Sun leave Earth?"</p>
    <p>"Accessory to commit terrorist acts, theft of government property, and aiding in the escape of a suspect for criminal proceedings," Moore rattled off.</p>
    <p>"And if you had gone to court and been convicted, what were you facing?"</p>
    <p>"If convicted of all three charges we would have each gotten twenty years to life."</p>
    <p>"That's a pretty long time. Would it have been worth it?"</p>
    <p>Moore and Bemear exchanged a look. "Yes," they said together. "Every second of it," Moore added quietly. "John had his reasons for leaving, but the government, understandably, didn't want to let him go. Knowing John, he probably would have found a way somehow to leave, or his friends on Moya would have come down with a lot of weapons to get him away. Anyone who got in their way would probably be dead now. Even if it had cost us our freedom, we still would have saved people's lives."</p>
    <p>"You and Crichton were best friends. Did he tell you why they had to leave?"</p>
    <p>"Yes." Moore smiled but didn't elaborate. It was the same reaction all journalists got when they asked the question of the Crichton family. Even watching now, Shannon still felt frustrated by it.</p>
    <p>"Don't ask me," said Bemear. "I don't know the main reason either."</p>
    <p>"If you didn't know, then why did you help?"</p>
    <p>"Because it was the right thing to do."</p>
    <p>The interview cut off and switched back the Debra Wilkins at the anchor desk. "It appears that the government believed a light sentence was 'the right thing to do' as well," she said. "Able to continue their work on the alien technology, the IASA Farscape Project has soared - literally. Next week on First Contact Day, the Farscape III fitted with the Faster Than Light Hetch Drive, is set to launch. More on that story when we come back."</p>
    <p>Shannon hated the brevity of her piece, but the Conspiracy was old news, so it couldn't be helped. Perhaps she would call Jack Crichton again to see if he was interested in doing an interview yet. She doubted it, but it never hurt to ask. One day she would get it.</p>
    <p>***********************************************************************</p>
    <p>Rhia wanted to scream. They had come back. With a deep breath, she controlled her impulse and waited quietly, continuing her work. Just a little bit longer... a little longer... a little... Now! Letting loose her yell, Rhia pounced on her little brother and Essor, grabbing each by the wrist before they could get away.</p>
    <p>"I told you to get out of here!" she shouted at them. Rhia dragged them out of her room before they got loose. "Ow!" she cried when the two boys resorted to teeth. "Seth, I'm gonna kill you!"</p>
    <p>"Gotta catch us first!" her brother yelled happily as he and Essor ran away giggling. Rhia ran after them, her longer legs swiftly catching her up.</p>
    <p>"Owwwwwwww!" shrieked Essor when she yanked on his shirt. "Rhia! That hurts!"</p>
    <p>"It's gonna hurt a lot more if you don't stay out of my room!"</p>
    <p>"It's my room too!" Seth shouted back impishly. Rhia dragged him to his tip-toes "Pilot!!!" he shrieked.</p>
    <p>"Rhia Sun!" Pilot's voice echoed through her comm. "Put Seth down now."</p>
    <p>"But - " she protested, letting the brat stand on his own again.</p>
    <p>"Rhia!" Dad's voice interrupted. Rhia glared at him as he stalked down the corridor. Now she was going to get in trouble when it was all Seth and Essor's fault. "Seth, Essor, don't you move," Dad's voice cracked like a whip, stopping the boys in their tracks as they tried to sneak away. "Now what's going on?"</p>
    <p>Rhia started to explain at the same time the boys did only to be cut off a moment later by Dad who nodded at her to continue. "They've been bothering me all day, Dad. They won't leave me alone. I told them to leave twic, and they came back so I was just chasing them away."</p>
    <p>"That's not true! She jumped us!" said Seth indignantly.</p>
    <p>"She hurt my neck, John," Essor added.</p>
    <p>"That wasn't my fault!" Rhia protested.</p>
    <p>"Yes, it was," Essor shouted back.</p>
    <p>"No it wasn't!"</p>
    <p>"All right, quiet!" Dad shouted over them. "Boys, go play somewhere else. I don't want - "</p>
    <p>"But Daad!"</p>
    <p>"I don't want to see you on this tier!" Dad stared at them till they reluctantly nodded. "And Rhia, I want you to stop beating them up."</p>
    <p>"I didn't!"</p>
    <p>"Go on now, shoo." Dad waved a hand at the boys until they scampered off to bug someone else. It was so unfair. Rhia stared at Dad's boots, feeling the injustice to her bones. Just because she was nine and they were six everything was *her* responsibility. "Come on, Rhia, look at me." She refused.</p>
    <p>"It wasn't my fault," she said defiantly.</p>
    <p>Dad sighed. "Yeah, I know. Being the oldest sucks." He forced her head up with a finger under her chin. "But you're bigger than they are. That means - "</p>
    <p>"I gotta be careful," Rhia finished.</p>
    <p>"Yeah," Dad smiled. "So how's the math coming?" he asked changing the subject. Dad offered Rhia his hand and she took it for the walk back to her room.</p>
    <p>"I hate math."</p>
    <p>"That's not going to get you out of doing it," Dad grinned down at her without any sympathy. Rhia scowled. What did she need math for anyway? The way she saw it, she needed to learn how to fight and fly more than she needed to know how to multiply and divide fractions. But Dad insisted. Said she needed it before she could get to more interesting things like physics and chemistry which would one day save her life. Rhia thought that was a load of dren.</p>
    <p>"It's so stupid, though!" she complained. "Who cares if you have three quarters of a half anyway?"</p>
    <p>"Rygel would if it were food. D'argo would if it were troops," Dad replied.</p>
    <p>Okay. Maybe. Rhia wasn't ready to give in, but knew better than to argue. She just wished Mama were home so she could learn to fight more. "When will Mama come home?" she asked as they entered her room. Ignoring the mess, Rhia went to her bed to retrieve the work she had done since she knew Dad would want to look at it.</p>
    <p>"It'll be a while, sweetie," he said. "Crais and Talyn were separated for a long time and the healing process is slow for both of them." He joined her on the bed and accepted the notebook. He looked over it, a small smile passing over his lips. "For someone who hates math, you're not bad at it," he commented.</p>
    <p>Rhia shrugged, unimpressed with herself. "Are they going to be all right? Talyn and Crais?" she asked.</p>
    <p>Dad set the notebook aside and pulled Rhia onto his lap. "Yeah," he said. "They're gonna be okay." He kissed her forehead, and Rhia relaxed against him. "And one day all this fighting will be over," Dad went on softly. "And we will be able to live in peace."</p>
    <p>"Like one of Grandpa's fairy stories with 'happily ever after?'"</p>
    <p>"Something like that."</p>
    <p>Rhia remembered Grandpa's princes and princesses going on adventures and living happily for the rest of their lives, rich in a castle. It was a life Rhia couldn't even imagine. She'd said as much to Grandpa once, and he had laughed and told her that very few people on Earth could image what her life was like. It was funny thinking of Earth now. It felt so long ago, like another life or a dream. The memories were fading.</p>
    <p>"I miss Grandpa," she said. "Will we ever go back there?"</p>
    <p>"One day, Rhia," Dad replied. "One day we will return to Earth."</p>
    <p>"Good." Rhia smiled. "I'd like that."</p>

    Section 14: Storm Front<p>**************************************************************************** ********************************************************************</p>
    <p>"But couldn't we find a sun within a reasonable distance that has flares. Your ship is a deep space ship isn't it?"</p>
    <p>She wouldn't let up. Ever since they had left his latest wormhole room, Sam Carter had been bombarding John with questions and ideas, one after another, trying to figure out a way to make or modify another wormhole. She started with the easy stuff - making a wormhole and was now getting into the parts John didn't rightly understand. He tried to be patient with her. He understood where she was coming form, really he did, but dammit, he was tired and hungry and sick of wormholes.</p>
    <p>"Maybe," John replied with a sigh. "Thing is we'd also need a planet to use as a gravity source that wasn't too far away."</p>
    <p>"But if we found one, you could do it?"</p>
    <p>"Maybe," he repeated. "The wormhole wouldn't be that stable though, and since I've never been to your reality, I probably wouldn't be able to find it."</p>
    <p>"And how do you find these alternate realities?" asked Teal'c.</p>
    <p>Now there was the $64,000 if John ever heard one. John didn't answer for a minute, trying to pinpoint what went on in his head. "It's kinda like . . . I can get to places I've been, times that are close enough to where I'm supposed to be, though Einstein said that was real dangerous. It's like a . . . familiar scent . . . like you wake up in the morning and your mom's cooking breakfast and it takes you a minute to sort out what's she's frying, but you know it's breakfast. And then suddenly, you know it's bacon and French toast. And that's when I come out."</p>
    <p>"French toast?" Teal'c raised a puzzled eyebrow.</p>
    <p>John turned to the wide-eyed Major. "You understand what I'm saying right?" Though from the looks of it, she didn't. With a sigh, John continued down the corridor.</p>
    <p>"You navigate by smell?" she asked for clarification.</p>
    <p>"Yeah." He didn't look at her.</p>
    <p>"Okay." Sam was silent and, when John snuck a look at her, processing his hound dog technique. He could have sworn he saw a grin etch across her face before she turned back to him. "Okay," she repeated. "Let's just say for the moment that you could navigate back to our reality. Could you still make the wormhole?"</p>
    <p>This time John turned to face her. "*If* we find a sun with flare activity, *if* that sun has a planet I can slingshot off of while the flares are going, *if* the wormhole was stable enough afterwards, and *if* I could nose out your reality, the plan would work. That's a lot of 'ifs," he added gently. Sam looked away, hurt by his sudden attack, making John feel like he had just kicked a puppy. "Look. . . It's not that I don't want to help. We'll figure something out. Just . . . I don't know yet."</p>
    <p>Sam mustered up a smile that John returned. They continued on in silence until John led them to Chiana's quarters. Surprised, Sam and Teal'c stopped at the doorway, unsure of their welcome. Chiana was in bed, nestled against a sleeping D'argo. Her eyes flickered open as soon as she heard him come in, following him as he came and sat beside her.</p>
    <p>"Hey, Pip." John reached out and brushed a strand of hair from her eyes. "How you doin'?"</p>
    <p>Chiana's smile faded into a grimace. "Hurts. Grandma won't give me anymore stuff since I was so loaded before. Said it'd kill me. Like I'm not dying now."</p>
    <p>"You're not," John told her. God, he hated seeing her like this: still, quiet, and in pain. Normally she was full of cynicism and life, but now bitterness had crept back in and taken root. He could see it now that she was off the old woman's drugs. She was frail and tired, striped for the moment of the anger that would come. John wanted to ask her about what had happened, let her vent and rage as she never would against D'argo, help hold her together when she finally fell apart. Then he wanted to find the bastards that had done this to her and tear them to shreds with his bare hands, but he knew he'd have to fight the Luxan for that privilege.</p>
    <p>"How are you?" asked Chiana when the silence dragged on.</p>
    <p>John glanced down when she grabbed his hand. He didn't want to think about how he was because then he'd have to think about his last few days held in naked captivity, being prodded by scientists, cutting himself away from his home, cutting Pilot away from Moya, Aeryn, and his impending fatherhood. Except that last one wasn't so bad.</p>
    <p>"Did Aeryn tell you we're having the baby?"</p>
    <p>"You are?" Delight lit Chiana's face up like a Christmas tree.</p>
    <p>"You are?" D'argo quit pretending to be asleep. John smiled at the simple grin that split his friend's face. "We knew you proposed - "</p>
    <p>"*I* knew you proposed," Chiana broke in. "But you're really having a baby?"</p>
    <p>"Yep," John grinned proudly, once again feeling the sudden happiness that made him want to shout out the good news. "It's mine. . . or his, but that doesn't matter. Ours, anyway."</p>
    <p>"So when are you getting married?" asked Chiana.</p>
    <p>"Soon as we can," he said. Just thinking about it made John grin wider. Married. To Aeryn. It was finally happening. Both Chiana and D'argo were smiling back at him. "D'argo, you'll be my best man, right?"</p>
    <p>"That stand by you thing? I'd be honored."</p>
    <p>"Hey! What about me? Can I be best woman?" Chiana asked.</p>
    <p>John squeezed the hand he still held. "You'll have to ask Aeryn, but I doubt she wants Granny to do it."</p>
    <p>Chiana giggled. "Rad. Cool," she added the earthism as an afterthought.</p>
    <p>"You gotta be mobile for the ceremony though, so I'll let you rest," said John. "I'll bring you guys something later."</p>
    <p>"Right. Go. Kiss Aeryn," D'argo ordered sternly. "And don't keep us waiting."</p>
    <p>"I won't." John dropped a kiss on Chiana's forehead and patted D'argo on the shoulder before leaving, the two humans in tow.</p>
    <p>"Congratulations," said Sam once they started down the hallway again.</p>
    <p>"Thanks." John smiled at her. "Do you have kids?"</p>
    <p>"No," she answered, startled by his question. "I'm not married either."</p>
    <p>"Married to your work?" He wasn't surprised when she nodded. After all, she went planet hopping for a living, and given the size of her gun, it was dangerous work. That and the sheer dedication it took to get into astrophysics didn't leave a lot of time for a social life. "What about you, T?"</p>
    <p>Teal'c regarded him for a moment before answering. "I have a half grown son." The dude seriously needed to get a second facial expression. "I do not get to see him very often."</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry," said John. He thought of Jothee and Talyn, the first broken, the second dead. "Is he safe?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"That's something," he offered. Really he didn't know what to say. He couldn't imagine being separated from his child, and honestly he didn't want to think about it. So much could go wrong . . . better not to drive himself crazy by dwelling on possibilities.</p>
    <p>They reached the center chamber where Rygel, Aeryn, Joe, and Jackson were already fixing a meal. Well, Aeryn and the humans were. Rygel had taken on the 'managerial' role.</p>
    <p>"Carter, Teal'c!" Joe - Jack, John reminded himself - was the first to notice their arrival. "Figured out how to get us home yet?"</p>
    <p>"Working on it, sir," Sam replied.</p>
    <p>John ignored the friendly banter that picked up around him about alternate realities as he made his way over to Aeryn. She smiled as he approached. "You stopped and saw Chiana?" she guessed the reason for his lateness, and John nodded. "How is she?"</p>
    <p>"Wants to be best woman in the wedding," he replied.</p>
    <p>"Jack said only the groom had a best man. I get a matron of honor and bridesmaids. We don't have any maids on board."</p>
    <p>"We'll improvise."</p>
    <p>"How is she really?"</p>
    <p>"In pain. Granny can't give her any more meds right now, so she's riding it out with D'argo, and before you say it, not that way." Aeryn grinned at him. "I'm worried about her," John went on soberly.</p>
    <p>"She's a survivor," said Aeryn. Her eyes were calm when they met his, saying so much more than words. They were all survivors and they would get through this random act of cruelty like they got through everything, by holding onto each other no matter how impossibly.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn, Crichton," Pilot's voice interrupted over the comms. Around them, the humans fell silent, waiting for an explanation.</p>
    <p>"What's up, Pilot?"</p>
    <p>"Moya senses . . . a ship approaching. Like the one before that took you only. . . much bigger."</p>
    <p>"Frell!" Aeryn spat the word out. "The last one was a fighter. This must be a troop transport."</p>
    <p>"What's going on?" asked Jack. All traces of his earlier joviality were gone leaving the colonel in charge.</p>
    <p>"Our friends didn't appreciate us leaving the party early," John told them.</p>
    <p>"Looks like a troop transport," added Aeryn in English this time.</p>
    <p>"Right. So what's the plan?"</p>
    <p>Plan? Frelled if John knew. Moya was a sitting duck and the fridge-faces were pissed off. Oh well. Like anything else was new.</p>
    <p>"Hide?" Aeryn suggested.</p>
    <p>"Split up and ambush?" he threw back. "D'argo?"</p>
    <p>"I heard," his friend's voice came back. "Everyone meet in Chiana's quarters. Pilot says they'll be here in a couple hundred microts."</p>
    <p>"No time," John and Aeryn said in unison. Exchanging wry smiles, they headed out. "We're on our way."</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Okay, sorry there wasn't more here. But it's totally not my fault that John decided to go see how Chi was doing. I tried, I really did, but I couldn't stop him, (you know how he stubborn he gets). Anyway, I hope to have the next bit out by Sunday. Keep the pressure on.</p>

    <p>So first let me just thank everyone for their kind reviews. I'm completely blown away by the reception my little story's gotten. Thank you all so much!</p>\n\
    <p>A quick note on the timeline: I didn't really give it much thought when I started, but I feel it needs clarification. When Jack and Xander meet it is late June or July. That means Jack got the call from the clerk's office in January or so and I'm assuming that the poor understaffed government office took that long to get to Jessica Harris's last will and testament. So for the Scoobies, it has been a year since the last battle and they have spent their time finding slayers and setting up a new council, which I imagine would be hard slow work. Hope that helps.</p>\n\
    <hr>Three Minutes Late<hr>Saturday morning Xander was late to the clinic. Jack had of course arrived early and then spent twenty minutes not reading some article in People and glancing at his watch. He wasn't worried. Really. After all his son was the one who had set up the appointment, but nonetheless he let out a sigh of relief when Xander banged through the door.<p>\"Sorry, I'm late,\" he flashed a quick yet harried smile. \"Small crisis in Girlville.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack stood, his earlier irritation quenched now that he was here. \"What happened?\" he asked as they went to the desk to check in. Xander greeted the nurse by name as she handed him the forms they needed to fill out with a coy smile. Looked like someone had a crush, mused Jack, though Xander merely thanked her politely and went to sit down, oblivious.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, you know, the usual 'she looked at me funny' thing,\" said Xander, frowning at his pen that refused to write. \"Does yours work?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack tried it and nodded, wondering instead what Xander was talking about while his son asked the shy nurse for another pen. \"So what thing is that?\" he asked when the young man rejoined him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Huh?\" Xander looked up, the confusion on his face quickly dissipating as he caught up. \"Oh, there's this whole . . . thing. You know, where one girl looks at another and makes her cry.\" He must not have look convinced because Xander added, \"Yeah, I don't get it either,\" before turning back to his form.</p>\n\
    <p>The paperwork didn't take long to complete, and before Jack knew it, they were being led into an examination room where another nurse Xander knew named Cathy scraped the insides of their cheeks with a half dozen Q-tips.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is that it?\" he asked in surprise as she took off her gloves.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's it,\" Cathy smiled. \"Now we just send it off to the lab on Monday and we'll mail you the results by Friday.\" It seemed too simple for it to be legit. Janet was always shining lights and poking and prodding, and now the inside of his cheek would tell them what they need to know? He and the Doc were going to have a serious conversation when he got back.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, how's Lydia doing?\" asked Cathy over her shoulder as she led them back to the waiting room.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She's good now,\" Xander told her. \"Not much keeps them down. Like Energizers. The batteries, I mean,\" he tripped over this last, making Jack smile.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's good to hear,\" Cathy held the door for them as they left. \"And I hope everything works out for you guys.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thanks.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The door closed, leaving the two of them alone in the sunshine, another awkward pause filling the space between them. \"So you come here often?\" Jack's curiosity finally got the better of him.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shrugged, his face devoid of anything readable. \"The girls sometimes get hurt. And being in the very scary position of responsibility, guess who gets to drive.\" Jack didn't have anything he cared to say aloud to that. \"So when's your plane leaving?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"One-seventeen,\" said Jack, looking at his watch. It was almost eleven now. He'd have to leave soon to make it through security. When he looked back up, Xander was watching him closely out of his single eye. Jack wondered suddenly what he looked like without the eyepatch.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So I guess this is it, huh?\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, I hope not,\" said Jack with a grin trying to dispel the sudden seriousness of the conversation. He knew it was a defense mechanism, but hey, it worked. \"Now that you got me, I don't intend on leaving you alone. Besides, your little Buffy will rip my arms off if I don't come back.\"</p>\n\
    <p>That startled a laugh out of Xander. \"You really shouldn't underestimate Buffy,\" he said, shaking his head and grinning wryly. \"And you really, really shouldn't call her little.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Touchy?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Very.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sounds like other short people I know.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But this one can rip your arms off.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, we can't have that now, can we? So I guess I better keep in touch?\" Jack turned this last into a hopeful question, slightly rocking on his heels. Xander didn't respond for a moment.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're that sure?\" he asked softly, doubt coloring his voice. \"About me? I mean, I could be an axe murderer for all you know.\" And underneath the sarcasm Jack heard a scared young man wondering why he cared.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack smiled and shook his head, a little taken aback by the emotion in the gaze that bored into his soul. \"You're not an axe murderer,\" said Jack solemnly, for once not hiding behind humor. \"You're my son. And I know you don't really trust me right now,\" he let out a breath of cynical laughter, glancing at his shoes, \"especially since I messed up this whole meeting you thing.\" He looked up. \"But all I'm asking for is a chance.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, well,\" Xander didn't seem to know what to say. \"To save your arms, I guess you can call me. And if you'll, you know, still buy me a dog.\" A teasing smile snuck its way into the conversation and Jack's heart.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's a deal.\" And when Jack offered his hand and Xander took it, he felt like he'd been given the world.</p>\n\
    <hr>Xander closed the door with a heartfelt sigh when he got home. Around him the bubbly sounds of teenagers on their free day bounced off the walls around him. Over to the right of the entranceway, the sitting room door wide open with one of the newbie cliques giggling over the rustle of magazines and newspapers. They paused when they heard him come in, several arching their necks to see who it was.<p>\"Xander!\" called Melissa, a tall ganlgy brunette that reminded him of a stork with freckles. \"How'd it go?\"</p>\n\
    <p>He smiled for them as he ambled over to the doorframe. \"Fine,\" he shrugged, though he still didn't know how he felt about it. \"Cathy says hi.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Cool, she was there?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, we're going to see a movie today,\" spoke up Ashley. \"You wanna come?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What movie?\"</p>\n\
    <p>A half a dozen titles cluttered the air as soon as he asked. Xander recognized a few of them and knew he definitely wasn't in the mood for the chick flicks. He needed something brainless and full of hitting people over the head with big guns. And a good chase scene. He'd probably end up watching <i>Wrath of Khan</i> again with Andrew and a few of the girls. Man, he really needed to get some guy friends to watch real guy movies with that didn't involve men in jumpsuits, he thought as the girls continued to squabble. \"Let me know when you decide,\" he interrupted the movie debate, turning toward the kitchen. \"And don't forget to put it on the board so we can get you a ride.\"</p>\n\
    <p>With a chorus of, \"we won't s\" with regard to the activity board, also affectionately known as the Where-the-Hell-is-she? board, Xander left them for the kitchen where he found Andrew complaining loudly to pair of hungry slayers. \"Xander!\" Andrew whined as soon as he saw him. \"Tell them they can't just come in here when I'm trying to get lunch together and pick at the Cardassian egg salad!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's good salad!\" Veronica tried appeasing Andrew looking for the world like a regretful eight-year-old, which wasn't hard considering she was barely over five feet tall.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, eat something else,\" said Xander shaking his head and wondering as he always did how he had ended up as the peacemaker around here. It still surprised him more than Andrews Star Trek dishes. He wondered if the egg salad would get voted onto the make-it-again-and-die list that was stuck to the pantry door with a dagger. \"Andrew,\" he got back to his original purpose for being in the kitchen at all, \"do you have your shopping list ready?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, because some people keep coming in and just eating the lunch I've spent the last two hours slaving over without a . . . a can-I-please?\" The house chef glared at the two girls who didn't look the least bit ashamed, which of course only made Andrew pout harder. Damn. Xander was going to have to get him another Hallmark card. He so did not need a rebellious cook on his hands again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"After lunch then?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine,\" said Andrew sullenly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right, come on,\" Xander shooed the two girls out of the kitchen. \"Let's let his Cardassianness work.\" They left with Andrew muttering something gargly about proper titles. While the two girls headed out back to do girl things, Xander passed into the dining room and plopped down at the table. Dawn, Giles, and their piles of books looked up and smiled. Well, the books would have if books smiled, but then they were books. And Xander didn't like books. They were one of the sure signs of the apocalypse. \"So what's all this?\" he waved a vague hand at the ill-omened tomes.</p>\n\
    <p>\"One of the patrols last night ran into an unknown demon,\" said Giles who had just returned his nose to the page. His shirt-sleeves were rolled up to his elbows and a pencil twitched between his fingers as he read whatever it was he was reading. \"Redish brown, five horns, and a rather large . . . 'squick' factor.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nope, not ringing any bells,\" said Xander. \"So what happened to the research-your-own-stupid-demons policy?\" It was, hands down, his favorite policy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's Saturday,\" said Dawn who hadn't yet gone back to her work. \"Most of this stuff is my bastardized Sumerian.\" Her face crinkled at the evil books that were tying up her Saturday. Or at least her morning. Last night's entertainment had been watching her and Giles go head to head over what constituted a day off. Unfortunately prophesies were time-critical, and they had ended in this compromise with the argument that she got to sleep in during the rest of the week anyway.</p>\n\
    <p>Absently Xander grabbed <i>Argyle's Compendium</i> off the top of the much smaller stack of demon books before remembering he hated these books with a passion and for once didn't have to do the research. So there, he tossed the book back with a light thud as it slid to a stop. He grinned at Dawn who brightly returned the smile while Giles appeared not to have noticed at all. \"So who's the lucky group?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We-Love-Orlando-Bloom,\" Dawn told him. \"I think they're holed up with <i>Pirates</i> right now.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ahh,\" Xander nodded, not surprised in the least.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So how did it go?\" she asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine,\" Xander shrugged as he had before. \"He went straight to the airport after. And Cathy's gonna send a couple samples to Fred.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And how are you with all this?\" Giles spoke up, his attention now focused on Xander who shrugged again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What's there to feel? Everything's back to normal.\" He stared at the tabletop, the emotions that had subsided with his return home bubbling back to the surface. Confusion, hope, dread, and a little anger at Jack for doing this to him. His life was crazy enough without some stranger trying to be a part of it. One he couldn't share. And yet, Xander found himself wondering what it would be like to have a parent that cared all to himself.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander?\" Giles prompted softly.</p>\n\
    <p>He looked up at the older man and suddenly wondered if Jack would ever measure up to him. \"I don't know,\" said Xander, the indifferent fa\xC3\xA7ade slipping. \"It's all just so . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hellmouthy?\" Dawn finished as he struggled for words.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, but also in a big kinda not way.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You mean it is so un-hellmouth-like that it must be hellmouthy?\" asked Giles who then frowned to himself, both trying to understand his own sentence and appalled that he had said 'hellmouthy.'</p>\n\
    <p>\"Something like that,\" Xander agreed. Honestly, he could do without all this emotional stuff right now. The last couple of days had been exhausting, and he was tired of feeling all mixed up. He'd just lost his real parents for good and now Jack was there being the parent he had always wanted. It was a like a parent market, one for two deal. \"I told him he could call me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you think he will?\" asked Dawn.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, actually,\" Xander let out a huff of laughter. \"I think he might.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I guess that's cool.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\" Their eyes met and Xander slowly grinned. It would be cool. As long as he wasn't a slimy creature of the dark or an asshole, that is, the cynical voice in his head chirped. But he just mentally shrugged it away. After all, there were good demons like Clem around.</p>\n\
    <p>For a few moments the three of them sat silently, sharing the quiet. In the background, Xander heard gaggles of girls talking and laughing. Giles was the first to turn back to his work with Dawn following soon after, her light smile remaining. Xander watched them, so different and so alike in their work.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Honestly!\" Giles suddenly broke the silence with an exasperated sigh, whipping off his glasses and polishing them on his shirt. \"'And he shall smite him down with pink sandals,' Dawn?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It says 'pink'!\" Dawn protested with an angry jab at the original text before her.</p>\n\
    <p>As the two of them broke into an argument over their Sumerian bastard, Xander chuckled to himself before slipping quietly away.</p>\n\
    <hr>Jack stifled a yawn as he made his way through the crowded terminal to the baggage claim. He hated flying commercial; there were too many people and not enough space for half of them. And it was noisy and so incredibly, mind numbingly boring, and right now he just wanted to get out of the airport. The doors were nearby but unfortunately so were about a million other people jostling for their bags. As he was pushing and shoving his way through the masses, he heard someone call his name.<p>The someone turned out to be Daniel who was there to pick him up. Jack grinned, happy to finally see a friendly face after his long trip. \"How was your flight?\" asked Daniel when Jack finally reached his side.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Very long and dull,\" said Jack, adjusting his grip up his single bag that he had thankfully carried-on with him. \"Next time I'm gonna claim there's a dangerous pot or something in Cleveland so I can fly myself.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel smiled and shook his head at him. \"Car's this way,\" he said turning toward the sign that said East Parking Deck. \"So your trip was good?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shrugged. \"I met him. Can't say it went like I planned.\" Daniel gave him an inquisitive look asking for an explanation. \"He goes by Xander. And yes, you were right,\" Jack cut his eyes at his friend, hating to admit it and feeling petty for it at the same time. \"He didn't believe me at first. Had one of the girls at the house check if the birth certificate was real though I don't know how.\" It had been awfully quick too, now that he thought about it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Girl?\" Daniel interrupted his thoughts. Jack shook himself back to the present. He'd get Carter to look into it later, along with that Giles character and the camp.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah. He and a couple of friends run a summer self defense camp for teenage girls.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know,\" said Jack, scrubbing a hand through his hair. He felt sticky and gross all over. \"I mean, it didn't look like anything was really going on; the kids all liked him. It's just set up in a house in the suburbs.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, they did just lose their town a year ago,\" Daniel reasoned as they reached the car. He unlocked it, and Jack threw his bag in the back before clambering into the front passenger seat. \"It's not a cult is it?\" he asked suddenly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" Jack shook his head. Definitely not a cult from how talkative the girls were, but it just seemed so odd. But then the whole experience had been odd, even for him. \"You know, I was expecting a carpenter. A man with a nine to five job, maybe a girlfriend. Definitely not kids. And definitely not a denmother for a bunch of girls.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"A bit of a shock?\" Daniel smiled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Like a hurricane. But maybe that was just seeing him.\" His son. The idea still gave him chills. Things had gone so wrong with Charlie. He hadn't been there enough, hadn't been there when Charlie had found his gun. Now, Xander was giving him a chance to be there for him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, sorry. What was that?\" He realized Daniel had just asked him a question.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I asked what he's like?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack thought back, trying to capture what he had seen on that first meeting. \"He lost his left eye recently,\" he said quietly after a moment. \"I asked about it, probably shouldn't have.\" He could still remember his son's good eye challenging him to push harder and see how far it got him. \"The kids like him,\" he went on. He didn't know what else to say. How do you describe someone you had barely met? They hadn't talked much, just that first stilted conversation, then the one over dinner. \"He's got a sense of humor,\" he added with a smile. \"And he rescued me from his friends that threatened to kill me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" That brought Daniel up short, and Jack pointed to the road his friend was suddenly ignoring. \"They threatened you?\" Daniel returned his eyes to the front.</p>\n\
    <p>\"This girl, Buffy, threatened to rip my arms off if I dropped out of Xander's life, and his good buddy Mr. Giles outright told me he'd kill me if I hurt him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That speaks highly of him,\" said Daniel. \"Xander, I mean.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Jack couldn't stop the grin from spreading across his face. \"And he said he'd give me a chance.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just like that?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well,\" Jack didn't meet his friend's eyes. \"There may have been some shouting and apologizing and a paternity test. He was wondering why I would even care about him. Makes me wonder . . .\" he trailed off. Daniel didn't say anything, but the glance they shared said it all. The thought of a not so happy home had only occurred to Jack on the flight back. \"So what have you been up to while I was away feeling awkward?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel gave him another look, but decided not to protest the change in subject. \"Negotiations,\" he replied sourly. \"The Yibbites are almost as stubborn as you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey! I'm not the only stubborn one on the team.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, but Sam's at least nice about it,\" Daniel shot back with a quick grin. Jack mock glared at the neat derailment of his teasing.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Our next mission's on Monday?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel grinned even wider at his ungraceful attempt to change the subject, but again, he went with it, nodding. \"Though I'm still behind on my paperwork from our last mission because of the Yibbite negotiations.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, me too,\" Jack sighed. His unexpected trip had foiled his procrastination technique. Now he would be writing reports all day tomorrow. God, he hated paperwork.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So when do you find out?\" asked Daniel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Find out what?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"The results of the paternity test.\" Oh. That.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Friday or thereabouts.\" But he had already decided that it didn't matter. Jessica said Xander was his, so Xander was his as far as he was concerned, and he wasn't going to back out of it. \"It was more for their peace of mind.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know,\" said Daniel quietly, a million reassurances in those soft words. The little doubts that had popped up their ugly heads every so often shuffled away. \"So pizza?\" Daniel asked as they arrived in Jack's neighborhood.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Pizza sounds great,\" Jack agreed. They rode in a comfortable silence the rest of the way to Jack's house. The conversation wasn't over, just paused for later. Jack found himself wondering what Xander would think of his house and his friends. Maybe one day he'd get the chance to find out.</p>\n\

  content: "Original Author's Notes:<p>Part 1:</p>\n\
    <p>Disclaimer: It's okay, you can say it: \"Tassos owns Farscape.\" There, that wasn't so bad, was it? And you thought lying was hard, pfft!</p>\n\
    <p>Author's Notes: Okay, I know there are a million future fics out there and it will probably seem like I'm ripping everyone of them off but remember this, Shakespeare stole all his good ideas too g. Seriously, I love future fics that ask what would John do if he found Earth again? Secret? Public? How would they face off? I never tire of reading them. Sometimes I agree with what happens and sometimes I don't. This is sort of my blending everything I like, with everything I think the characters will do according to their natures tentatively following future threads the FS universe has thrown out. I've also tried to take a few different angles that haven't been done before. Think of this story as the Post Season Three So Far Future Fic (I know that while I'm writing this someone else will come out with a PSTSFFF and I'll feel like I'm ripping them off too...)</p>\n\
    <p>For those of you who read my unfinished story Lost Children, you'll recognize the kids' names. I like them, so I used them.</p>\n\
    <p>Just so you know, my knowledge of some Earth procedures is very, very sketchy. I have never been to a cabinet meeting or a news broadcast or a space station or ... you get the idea. So if I totally misrepresent your profession, sorry, you can drop me a note and I can try to fix they nails-down-the-blackboard problems. My knowledge is almost exclusively based on representations in movies, tv, and books.</p>\n\
    <p>Last thing, I have the second part mostly hand written and third done in my head. There will be a fourth part too. I am going to finish them and put them up someday, but it might be a while. If people like this part , I'll get it done faster. Feedback works magic.</p>\n\
    <p>This story is dedicated to the French language - without being bored and not understanding a word around me, I would never have gotten the tickling idea down on paper.</p>\n\
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>\n\
    <p>Part 2:</p>\n\
    <p>Disclaimer: Allez, vous pouvez le dire. \"Tassos est la propri\xC3\xA9taire de Farscape!\" Voil\xC3\xA0. Ce n'\xC3\xA9tait pas si difficile. Et vous avez cru que c'\xC3\xA9tait dur \xC3\xA0 mentir! Pfft!</p>\n\
    <p>Author's Notes: Just a reminder that this fic is based on Farscape's third season up to Fractures. I haven't seen Fractures, just read the transcript. I also won't see the season finale or season four until I get back to the States in July. (So everyone complaining about not having Farscape for months on end - don't complain about it to me! grin) The rest of the story will go directly to . and probably the Farscape bboard on . I don't know when I'll have the third part out. I'm shooting for the end of Mai.</p>\n\
    <p>The Microbe Theory: Okay, here's the microbe theory that I've come up with and that I use in my story. If you really don't care, skip it, I know it's kind of long, but it's different than the conventional understanding and here if you want to know. I finalized this while writing the second part so I apologize for any inconsistencies.</p>\n\
    <p>The translator microbes give the host the ability to understand alien/foreign languages. For me, what that means is that when an alien speaks, his words in his language go directly to meaning in my brain. Think of it as being fluent in a foreign language without the first four months of incomprehension. John hears D'argo speak in his garbled voice, not English, but he understands the words just like I understand my friends when they speak - the French goes directly to meaning, no interior translation necessary.</p>\n\
    <p>That said, I'm also assuming that after a period of time, the microbes will help someone learn how to speak the languages he hears on a regular basis, if the vocal cords physically allow it and the person practices enough. Think of this as learning how to speak Chinese: the sound system is so different that no matter how much one hears it it's still very hard to pronounce, (at least for us westerners). The microbes work in the brain, not the actual muscles. I'm assuming that most people wouldn't bother, (I mean would you?) Children who grow up in a multi-language environment such as Moya would be able to easily pronounce all languages in their vocal cord capability since they'd be hearing them as they learned to speak; that's how Rhia can speak hynerian.</p>\n\
    <p>(To read one must be able to sound out the words at least in their head of the language. Based on what we've seen I think that John and Aeryn speak both human/English and sebacean. I'd also think to uncomplicate things in an intergalactic society that there is a universal script that works like Chinese where a symbol stands for a whole word/concept so you could learn to read in any language. )</p>\n\
    <p>Last thing (I know I'm getting kinda long here), if you haven't been to the NASA website, it is really cool. It's real easy to find on a yahoo search. Now having been there, I've recognized several discrepancies with my story like the Space Station Control would actually be the Mission Control Center in Houston. But it's easier for me to have it in Florida. (If you want a backstory I'm sure I can make one up grin.) I figure it's IASA and eight years in the future and since it doesn't really matter anyway, I'm not going to worry about it.</p>\n\
    <p>As Puck says: \"clap your hands if we be friends.\" Feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>\n\
    <p>Now I'll shut up and let you read the story.</p>\n\
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>\n\
    <p>Part 3:</p>\n\
    <p>Disclaimer: It's okay, you can say it: \"Tassos owns Farscape.\" There, that wasn't so bad, was it? And you thought lying was hard, pfft!</p>\n\
    <p>Author's Notes: I just want to thank everyone for all the feedback. It really means a lot to me that people are reading and enjoying the story and telling me about it. The feedback really is what keeps me writing through all the tough spots.</p>\n\
    <p>As of April, this story is officially AU based on events up to and including Fractures. I haven't seen the last four episodes, only read the Journey Logs, so until July, they don't exist. Where it's possible I have adapted my back-timeline somewhat, but for the most part, it's the same as the one I started with way back when.</p>\n\
    <p>This part was hard to write because of all the relationships and reactions. It ended up being about ten pages longer than I expected. I did my best.</p>\n\
    <p>Part Three is dedicated to my friends who encouraged me while I panicked and were patient with me when I left them to write in the library, even without understanding why the hell I'm doing this or even what it's about exactly. (Et non, je ne vais pas la traduire!)</p>\n\
    <p>Part 4 will be out sometime in July probably. (After my Farscape marathon!)\n\
    Now, with great relief and pleasure, I proudly present...</p>\n\
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>\n\
    <p>Part 4:</p>\n\
    <p>Disclaimer: Allez, vous pouvez le dire. \"Tassos est la propri\xC3\xA9taire de Farscape!\" Voil\xC3\xA0. Ce n'\xC3\xA9tait pas si difficile. Et vous avez cru que c'\xC3\xA9tait dur \xC3\xA0 mentir! Pfft!</p>\n\
    <p>Author's Notes: Yaaay! Farscape rocks! I am finally home and caught up and can I just take a moment to say 'WOW!' I knew there was a reason I'm obsessed with this show! As far as notes go, I don't have many. Special thanks to Yahoo for the information on Pakistan and the official govt website for the JCS and military stuff. This part could probably have been twice as long, (and it's already 20 pages more than the first part!) but I wanted to get it finished on schedule. I couldn't do everything that popped into my head. (Maybe if I make it into a movie...)</p>\n\
    <p>I'd like to thank everyone who sent feedback: DekotaSkye, NotOnlyHuman, Feynor, Alison, Alynna Lis Eachann, Lynn, BetanSuvey, DM Baird, bigfatcat, Stone Cold, Lauria, Hidra2000, Nonnie, DaBear, Mariah M, ny, GalaxySun617, ajlighthouse, D13mila, Tick Tock, Rowan Seven, Kizmet, Gv2.0, Genesis, Lady FoxFire, Farscape Maniac, Mayco Skywalker, Brenna, Troy, starlight, Farscape Fan, syaoran li, Phil, Buffanatic, aminalhari, trisarahtops, elizbraybet, and special thanks to KFlowers for her wonderful questions that keep me on track. I'm really glad everyone is enjoying the story. I love feedback.</p>\n\
    <p>So that said, I have one simple request: please tell me what were your favorite and least favorite scenes from the whole story (parts 1 through the epilogue (which should be up soon)). Just what ever jumps into your head. It's okay if you don't have one or have more than one, you don't even have to answer if you don't want to. I'm just curious. Any other comments (good, bad, and constructive) are all welcome.</p>\n\
    <p>And now...</p>\n\
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>\n\
    <p>Epilogue:</p>\n\
    <p>Author's note: Okay, I know I should have had this out about three months ago but now that I'm in school, I have no time and oh so many other distractions from writing. So now that I've caught up on sleep, I know I can't put it off any longer. Thank you all for being patient (and if you weren't, like I get when authors take forever to finish their fic - don't tell me. My sisters probably give me enough flak to make up for all of yours.) So let the denounment begin...</p>\n\
    <p>Thanks to the online Federal Sentencing Guideline Manual.</p>\n\
    <p>********************************************************************************</p>\n\
    <p>The idea for this story came out of a question: What would happen if Moya returned to Earth and John wasn't aboard?</p>"

    Section 15: Rushing About<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Hey!" Jack shouted, more than a little frustrated that he and his team were being kept completely in the dark about what the hell was going on. In the frenzy of imminent attack, all the aliens had reverted to speaking alien, and the one-sided part he heard from Crichton was filled with parts of the ship that meant absolutely nothing to him. "Will someone tell us what's going on here?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn and D'argo both looked at Crichton who explained. "We're going to set up an ambush."</p>
    <p>Jack waited a moment. "That's it?" he asked when Crichton didn't continue.  "That's the plan?"</p>
    <p>"In a nutshell," said Crichton with a humorless smile that did little to reassure Jack. Sure they didn't have a lot of time, but there had to be something less . . . suicidal. Not that SG-1's luck was ever any better.</p>
    <p>"What kind of defenses does the ship have?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Us," said Aeryn briskly. "And you if you'll help. We need to split up though. Chiana needs to get to safety, then we need to get weapons and get in position to hit and hit hard when they come aboard."</p>
    <p>"Okay." Jack's mind sped over the situation. He and his team didn't know the ship so if they were going to help they needed to disperse among D'argo's crew. "We have weapons and explosives with our stuff. How are you splitting up?"</p>
    <p>"D'argo's getting Chi to the upper levels, me and Aeryn are going to find as much firepower as we can, Granny and Stark are in charge of the poison, and Rygel's storing the food. We'll meet you back here and get you where we need you" Crichton rattled off as the others started to move out.</p>
    <p>"Wait," Jack snapped out. "Daniel, go with Chiana and stay with her, keep her safe. Teal'c you're with them," he pointed to the two crazies. "Carter, you take John to get our gear, and I'll go with Aeryn to get your weapons."</p>
    <p>D'argo's people stared at him then at each other, taken by surprise and not quite sure what to do about it.</p>
    <p>"Let's move people," Jack snapped. It had the desired effect. With a muttered 'okay' from Crichton, the aliens moved and headed out without disputing his orders. Jack hurried after Aeryn.</p>
    <p>Jogging behind the black, leather clad woman, Jack marveled again at her ability to navigate through the ship. Unerringly she quickly led him from room to room. The first ones were lived in with pillows and extra blankets on the beds ranging from practical to what had to be Rygel's extravagant. Little knick knacks dotted the shelves, most of them surprisingly recognizable from Earth. When asked, Aeryn's only comment was that the humans on Crichton's Earth had given them money to go shopping. He guessed they didn't have much currency in this part of the universe.</p>
    <p>Jack waited by the doors of each room while Aeryn went in, quickly found anything remotely resembling a weapon, checked it, and either left it or took it with her. It wasn't until the third room that she did this more than once. This room was the sparsest one he'd seen so far if he ignored the collection of large boxes at one end. Here, Aeryn grabbed another handgun like the ones both she and John wore, two rifles one of which she discarded, and something that resembled a rocket launcher.</p>
    <p>"So who's room is this?" Jack asked while she checked the weapon over. It really was a beauty, kind of like a shortened bazooka.</p>
    <p>"Mine," said Aeryn absently to Jack's surprise.</p>
    <p>"But I thought . . ." Jack trailed off when she finally looked up with a glare that told him to back off. He really shouldn't have been surprised after their earlier conversation about wedding traditions in which Aeryn had neither asked for nor given away anything personal.</p>
    <p>Aeryn turned back to her inspection. "I knew I shouldn't have let him borrow parts," she muttered, putting the gun back on the shelf. "It's frelled," she said louder to Jack, leading him back out.</p>
    <p>"What happened?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"John needed part of the triggering mechanism for a bomb."</p>
    <p>"Bomb?" he asked but Aeryn either didn't hear him or was ignoring the question. Jack got the feeling that she ran on two gears: friendly but distant and closed off soldier, and he knew better than to push his luck.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn, D'argo" Crichton's voice cut over the ship's communication system. "We've got Sam's gear and are making for the maintenance bay. We'll take hammond side of the doors."</p>
    <p>A burst of alien words came from D'argo. "He's on his way down," Aeryn translated before saying to thin air, "Pilot, where are they?" Another burst of words sent Aeryn running through the halls. "He says they'll land in a hundred microts - a little more than your minute. He's already opened the doors."</p>
    <p>"What?! Why?"</p>
    <p>"We don't want Moya hurt by them blasting through." They ran on.</p>
    <p>"Carter? Teal'c?" Jack spoke into his radio.</p>
    <p>"I'm in position with Crichton, sir," his second responded. "We've got explosives rigged so you and Aeryn should find cover."</p>
    <p>"As long as you stay out of the hangar until they go, you should be fine," Crichton said over the other system.</p>
    <p>"I too am in position, O'Neill," Teal'c reported. "We will catch any that get by you."</p>
    <p>"Daniel?"</p>
    <p>"Safe and sound, Jack."</p>
    <p>"In here." Aeryn lifted a grate in the wall and wriggled in. "Access tunnels for DRD's and hostile takeovers. We can survive for days in these.  Rygel hides food all over."</p>
    <p>"Dare I ask how long ago?"</p>
    <p>"Better not." Aeryn looked over her shoulder and grinned. Jack returned it, recognizing the sudden diversion as a way to vent her nerves. She had been their prisoner after all, held for experimentation, some of which had taken place if her and Crichton's lack of clothing at their rescue was any indication.</p>
    <p>"Here," Aeryn took the rifle she had handed him during their search for weapons. "Pull this to engage. It fires one energy pulse shot each time you pull the trigger here." She quickly showed him the important qualities of the gun. "And under no circumstance close this or change it from this setting." She pointed to two adjustable settings on the top of the barrel.  "If you do it will overload and explode, and we'll be dead."</p>
    <p>"Oh, nice to know," Jack double checked the settings because he definitely wasn't doing that. Going 'kaboom' was going to be left for the bad guys.</p>
    <p>Aeryn led him a little ways further and stopped. Through the nearby grill they had a fairly comprehensive view of the room below, the maintenance bay just outside the hangar.</p>
    <p>"Now we wait," said Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"I hate waiting," said Jack.</p>
    <p>Aeryn grinned again. "Me too."</p>

    <p>This story is about Xander and Jack's relationship. All the other little things about Xander's demon fighting and Jack's missions are pretty random and made up on the spot and serve more as glimpses into their lives, so don't stress too much about them.</p>\n\
    <hr>Four Phone Calls<hr>The first thing Jack did when he got home after Friday's mission was make a bee line for the kitchen and the first beer he could lay his hands on. It had been one hell of a week. Three days of boredom listening to Daniel sweet talk the semi-civilized locals of some tree-infested planet followed by two days of sheer adrenaline when the non-Goa'uld priesthood decided to roast them for a barbecue. He hadn't slept since before the attack and was now under Janet's strict orders to get some rest. But he needed to unwind first, do something meaningless and mundane like watch TV.<p>So grabbing the mail that had accumulated over the past week, Jack stretched out on the couch with the remote and surfed through the channels till <i>Trading Spaces</i> caught his eye. Calm and domestic, it resonated in counterpoint to the noise, violence, and uncertainty of the mission and allowed his thoughts drift away.</p>\n\
    <p>Only when the ads came on did he look at his mail, separating the bills from the outright junk and finding one letter from the Munroe Health Clinic, Cleveland that brought him up short. The test results. Jack stared at the envelope for a second. He hadn't even thought about Xander for the past two days, life-threatening events taking precedent. Being reminded of it now made him smile. Quickly, he opened the letter and read the confirmation that he was Xander's father. He hadn't doubted it . . . well, maybe a little, but here it was. Father and son. It sent both chills and a wave of joy through him.</p>\n\
    <p><i>Trading Spaces</i> came back on, but Jack muted it, instead glancing at the phone. He suddenly wanted to call everybody. But first . . . what the hell. He'd said he could call. Jack grabbed the phone and after rooting around for it, dialed Xander's number. It rang twice before unsurprisingly a girl answered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hello?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, hi. It's Jack O'Neill. Can I speak to Xander?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack? Yeah, just a minute.\" She pulled away from the mouthpiece, but Jack still heard her shout for Xander. Noisy kids, he smiled, not bothered by it this time. At the moment, he didn't think anything could bother him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hello? Jack?\" Xander came on the line.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey. How you doin'?\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine. You?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good, good.\" There was a pause. The superficial nature of the conversation suddenly made Jack nervous. \"I hope you don't mind me calling,\" he began. \"But I got the letter from the clinic today.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, mine came yesterday.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So I just thought I'd call,\" Jack repeated, feeling kind of silly now that he had nothing to say.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, no it's cool!\" Xander pulled himself out of whatever funk he'd been in. \"I guess you weren't really surprised.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Were you?\" Jack asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, no. Yeah. I don't know.\" Xander paused. \"I guess yeah. Because, hey, how could this be happening? Suddenly I've got a parent out of nowhere.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, well, I'm \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey.\" Xander cut him off. \"It's no big. I mean, you called, right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right,\" Jack agreed though he wasn't sure what Xander meant. Just that it was good he had called. Right? God, he hoped so.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So how's life out in Whoville?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Whoville?\" Jack wasn't sure, but wasn't that Dr. Seuss? He grinned, the comment pleasing him for some reason, but maybe it was because Xander had asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You know, Colorado,\" Xander clarified.</p>\n\
    <p>Well as far as he knew, Colorado was fine, it was the rest of the galaxy that was giving him a hard time. \"It's good,\" he sighed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That bad, huh?'\" commented Xander, again both surprising and pleasing Jack that he had noticed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, well. The last couple of days have just reminded me why I hate organized religion,\" he said. \"It's useless, manipulative, and annoying.\" Not to mention dangerous.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Xander easily. \"It's got some pretty good uses.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Like what?\" Jack challenged. He bet he could shoot down anything his son said, but what Xander did say surprised him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Crosses, holy water. I mean, come on, how can you not love a blessed refreshment?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack chuckled. \"Cool yes; useful no.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It all in how you look at it,\" said Xander. \"If you're dying of thirst . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So I take it you're not very religious?\" asked Jack at this humorous sign of disrespect. He was even a little relieved in light of his own atheism.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You mean, do I believe in the Christian God? Don't know, haven't met him.\" Jack could practically hear him shrug. \"I don't believe there is anyone as powerful as they say he is.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's called faith, Xander,\" he smiled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well there's faith and there's faith, and the kind I got in my friends is the only faith I need.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's . . .\" Jack didn't know quite what to say to that, though he knew exactly what his son meant. Jack's own faith in his team and the SGC was all he needed to keep fighting. No all-powerful beings to help out or give them easy answers, just humans against the Goa'uld.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Pretty lame? \"Xander ventured, an unsure note in his voice.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" said Jack immediately. \"Not lame.\" He paused searching for words. \"As a soldier . . . well, what little faith I had when I started out, it became like you said. Your friends, your team, they're everything.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\n\
    <p>There was silence, neither one of them sure how to continue. Jack tried to think of another question to ask but couldn't think of anything that didn't feel like prying too deep, so instead he retreated back to more mundane things. \"So how was your week?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine. Normal for around here,\" said Xander. \"Mostly I've just been looking out for people.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's good.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Another an awkward pause.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Listen,\" Xander broke the silence. \"I've got to go. Dinner's soon. But thanks for calling.\" And he did seem glad which just made Jack grin again. His cheeks were starting to get sore.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll call again, sometime?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay, talk to you then. Bye.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Bye.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack hung up and turned back to the television. All in all, he thought, that went well. And he grinned wider.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <i>One month later</i><p>\"Willow!\" Xander cheerfully snatched the phone from Dawn's fingers, grinning at the young woman's knowing smirk. \"It's been ages. How are you? Where are you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>On the other end, his best friend laughed at the string of questions, and Xander grinned. It felt so good to hear that familiar sound. \"We're in Florida at the beach. Got in yesterday morning,\" said Willow. \"Except not the beach beach right now because I'm talking to you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah. So are there really demons there or are you a Kennedy just snuggling under the covers?\" he asked. He would bet even money that Florida's biggest crisis was a rainy day.</p>\n\
    <p>But Willow protested, \"There's demons! Really. We saw some the last night!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh huh.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay, so they were just hanging out at a club,\" Willow caved. \"And there might be more snuggling than working going on. But don't tell Giles.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I knew it!\" Xander crowed. \"And I think Giles already knows.\" At the Scooby meeting after Willow had called to suggest that she and Kennedy check out Florida, they had all just looked at each other, knowing.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Really? Is he mad?\" Willow asked, all of a sudden anxious and nervous that she was in trouble.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nah,\" Xander waved a hand she couldn't see. \"I think he's enjoying the vicarious smoochies with the rest of us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ewe, Xander!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's Giles!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know, but he's still significant other-less like the rest of us. And hey, who wouldn't want the think about two girls making out at the beach?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander!\" Willow screeched again like he knew she would, but he could also tell that she wasn't really upset, but rather flattered. \"Ooh, hey, guess what?\" She bubbled happily.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I got to intimidate these guys who were hitting on Kennedy!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Really?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah. We were at the beach lying on our towels near their volleyball game when their ball rolled over cause someone hit it out, so this guy came over to get it. Kennedy was next to the ball and I didn't even notice he was there until he started talking. He said something like 'Hey, how's it going.' And then he took his ball and they kept playing. Then after the game, he and a couple of his friends came over to say hi and invited us to a party tonight. So then one guy started asking Kennedy where she was from and stuff and then if she had a boyfriend all the while being Mr. Obvious-I-Want-To-Jump-You. So then I started to get a little annoyed and when Kennedy said no boyfriend I told him that if he didn't stop hitting on my girlfriend I'd make him a boy soprano in my totally scary way \xE2\x80\x93 but not bad scary, just to him scary.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And what did he do?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think we weirded him out, and his friends were laughing at him. But he was cool in the end, and we're still going to the party.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander chuckled. He could just imagine Willow's resolve face squaring off against a six foot nothing beach boy. \"So you're enjoying yourselves?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Willow said. \"You know, I just love doing the normal thing every once in a while.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Xander agreed. Normal was always a nice change from the bustle of their lives. On the other hand, too much normal would drive him crazy, he knew. Though it would help if he had another guy to hang out with.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So how's life at Scooby Central?\" asked Willow. \"Everything's okay?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just the usual. Vampire's roam. Slayers slay. I feel like all I ever do anymore is fix schedules, go over grocery lists, and keep everyone from tearing each other's hair out. Were girls always like this in high school?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep. Welcome to Hormoneland. Cat fights and snarking every hour on the hour,\" Willow quipped.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's like Cordelia concentrate here. Except all of them are stronger than He-Man. If this is what parents go through, I'm never having kids.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Willow laughed. \"That's why they invented summer camp, Xander,\" she said. \"And speaking of parents, I finally finished the search.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"On Jack?\" Xander perked up curiously. He still couldn't bring himself to call him 'dad,' even since the test results came back, both Cathy's and Fred's, the latter having come up one hundred percent human. Xander had in fact been greatly relieved and surprised by the feeling. But it was true. He liked Jack. The guy was just as new and unsure about how to do the whole father-son thing as he was, but he was trying, and that impressed Xander. His own dad had stopped trying by the time he was ten, and Giles, as much as Xander loved him, was more dad by default than effort to all of them.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes.\" In the background, Xander heard Willow shuffling some papers around. \"It took me a while to get to the Air Force database, especially since work and demon stuff kept interrupting. The military really have some tight systems . . .\" she trailed off and Xander waited patiently. The research had been an unspoken unanimous decision by all of them. The Initiative had made them all gun-shy where the military was involved, and father or not, there was too much at risk.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Here it is,\" Willow announced. \"So he works at NORAD like we found out earlier on the Deep Space Telemetry project code name Project Blue Book, though where they got that name from I don't know.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Riley was Lilac,\" Xander offered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Anyway,\" she went on, \"he's got a really good service record with some impressive medals from the Persian Gulf War, though almost everything he's done has been erased. I think because it's top secret we're-gonna-destroy- terrorism-by-being-terrorists government stuff. Wherever the files for this stuff are, I don't know. I doubt they're on the same server, if they're in a computer at all.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So he's Special Forces?\" That was like the best of the best, especially if all his missions were so secret.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah. If you want I can do some . . . more refined searches for the top secret stuff, but I'd kinda rather not,\" Willow offered.</p>\n\
    <p>Magic. Xander knew she would do it for him in a second if he asked, but he also knew how much it would cost her. It had been a little over two years since Tara, one since she had activated all the slayers, and the magic still made her nervous. And rightly so \xE2\x80\x93 she was just too powerful to use it lightly. \"No it's okay,\" Xander told her. \"It's probably all stuff we don't want to know anyway.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\" Willow sounded relieved. \"So has he called again?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Not yet.\" And that was not disappointment in his voice. Really. \"We'll see what happens.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I hope it works out,\" said Willow a little hesitantly. \"I mean, if you want it to,\" she added hastily. \"Cause if you don't, I'm all for the hating.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thanks,\" Xander grinned. There was no changing Willow. \"I kinda hope it works out too.\" He paused. \"How are your parents doing?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine, I guess.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"They're still in DC?\" They had moved there before the collapse of Sunnydale. He remembered when Willow had gone to tell them to get out of town, and they had wanted her to come with them, the overwhelming evil of the First registering on some level that had remained untouched by all the other demonic activity of the hellmouth. When she had refused, they finally seemed to understand that the shy girl they had raised, and even the one who had brought a girl home to meet them, was long gone, replaced by a woman who was staying because she knew what was coming.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep. We stopped by on our way south and went out to dinner. It was nice in a polite way. Dad still wants me to finish college since I've only got a year and a half left. He thinks I've been doing the 'backpacker' thing too long. And he wonders why the heck we decided on Cleveland.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Who would have thought that you would be a college drop out?\" Xander shook his head at the upheaval of the universe.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey! Extenuating circumstances!\" Willow said, indignant. \"Besides,\" she continued in a normal voice, \"I already talked to Giles. I might finish at Oxford. Since we're still trying to pull stuff together in England, I'd be like our liaison.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oxford?\" Xander was surprised. She wasn't coming home? She couldn't do that!</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm not going now or anything,\" she reassured him. \"And it would only be for two years when I did. And I'd visit every holiday.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And you're gonna come home drinking tea, talking like Giles, and swearing soccer is a million times better than any pansy sport we've got here,\" Xander groused, not liking the idea. England was so far away.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" Willow giggled. \"You said 'pansy.'\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did not!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did too!\"</p>\n\
    <p>Wait, he had, hadn't he. Damn. He really needed to get some guy friends that were not British, wimps, or vampires. \"Just rescue me from all the junior slayers first,\" he begged.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Promise,\" said Willow. \"Kennedy and I will be home in a month, so just hang on until then.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right.\" Just a month to go.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" Buffy knocked on the doorframe. \"Am I ever gonna get the phone?\" the Slayer whined with her best pitiful look.</p>\n\
    <p>Grinning, he said, \"Wills, I think Buffy's gonna kill me if I don't give you to her.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right, put her on,\" Willow laughed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right, love you,\" he said to his best friend</p>\n\
    <p>\"Love you, too.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander passed the phone on to Buffy who grinned in thanks before squealing, \"Willow!\" and disappearing into her room. He doubted she'd emerge anytime soon.</p>\n\
    <hr>The ringing phone woke Jack from his doze on the couch. A little disoriented at first, he fumbled in the dim light for the cursed contraption. He was on stand-down, for crying out loud. \"O'Neill,\" he answered.<p>\"Sir, it's me,\" his second in command's voice greeted him.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack rubbed his forehead. Of course. \"Carter, are you still on base?\" he asked reprovingly.</p>\n\
    <p>There was a moment of incriminating silence before she answered, \"Yes, sir,\" with a sigh that said I-know-but-tell-me-later.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Carter,\" Jack ignored the unspoken words. \"This is our first real break in almost a month.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I should be at home sleeping, yes, I know,\" Carter finished for him. \"I just had a few things to finish up here and one of the labs needed a consultation. I'll be out of here in an hour.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll be calling your house,\" he told her. And he would. His eyes flickered to the clock noting the time. One hour. That reminded him to check up on Daniel and make sure he wasn't doing anything stupid like not sleeping either.</p>\n\
    <p>Carter sighed again, but Jack thought it sounded like a smile too. \"All right,\" she said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what's up?\" Jack asked now that that was taken care of.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I had some free time while I was waiting for some results so I did that background check you asked me for about a month ago on Rupert Giles.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh?\" Jack only vaguely remembered asking. At the time he'd still been rattled by his visit to Cleveland. Thinking about it now, he felt a little like a . . . well, an overprotective parent. \"So what did you find out?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Rupert Giles a British citizen who's been living in the US for the last eight years, though according to immigration he went back to England for a year in 2002. He worked as a high school librarian in the '90s and then owned a shop, both in Sunnydale. His green card currently lists him as self-employed. His American record's clean: no arrests, no complaints.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I got into his British record,\" Carter went on. \"Two arrests when he was in his early twenties, once for assault and once for petty theft, but all the charges were dropped.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sounds like a case of stupid youth,\" Jack commented, feeling a little stupid himself at suspecting the man. The whole situation must have skewed his sense of danger about Mr. Giles, 'cause, really, a librarian? \"Anything else?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" Carter sighed. \"That was all I had time to get into. Non-government records are harder to track down. I can still do it if you want,\" she offered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, it's okay,\" Jack said. \"I think I was just being paranoid. He doesn't sound like he's in any secret cults or anything.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I only have the federal database to work with but since he's an alien everything gets reported to them,\" said Carter. \"And since he's not in the California system, I doubt he's done anything more serious than forget about a parking ticket.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you don't think it's weird that he runs a self-defense camp for girls with people half his age?\" Jack asked. It still was a little funny to him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"A little,\" said Carter. \"But you did say that your son's other friends running it were young women. Maybe it was their project.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And Mr. Giles?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know. Maybe you should ask him and stop guessing.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Carter.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm just saying, sir. You only met them once, and you said yourself that it didn't look like anything illegal.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay, okay, I'll stop,\" Jack ran a hand through his short hair. She was right, he was being paranoid. \"So you're going home now, Carter?\"</p>\n\
    <p>He swore he could hear her roll her eyes. \"Yes, sir. I'll be home in half an hour.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack glanced at the clock. That still put her home under her promised hour. \"Good. I'll call you then.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good night, sir,\" she said forcefully, telling him she didn't need a babysitter.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Night.\"</p>\n\
    <p>He hung up. Parking tickets, he shook his head. But now he knew where Xander had met Mr. Giles \xE2\x80\x93 the high school library. Xander who was a carpenter that had never gone to college was still friends with him. Once again Jack wondered just what had his son's home life been like.</p>\n\
    <hr>\"So we saw vamps here and here under the bridge,\" Rebecca pointed on the blown up map of a neighborhood in South Cleveland that was spread out over the dining room table. She and the other four members of Team Toesocks had run into a group of twenty eight-foot demons with a crew of vampires who were setting up shop in an abandoned building. The fight had been rough leaving them all with deep bruises and Amy, the youngest of the group, with a broken arm. Dawn had taken her to the ER to get it set, but the rest of the battered team sat around the table with Buffy, Xander, and Giles.<p>Xander's eye roamed over them while Rebecca told them what had happened. They were shaken up. This was their first big defeat and he could tell that it had shaken their confidence in their newfound skills. He knew that it was hitting them for the first time what a slayer's short life span really meant. Rachel and Leslie sat quietly with their hands in their laps, neither one quite looking at Rebecca. Beside Giles, Joanna fidgeted, her hands busy with a pencil and her eyes never leaving the table. She had a bright red scratch along her jaw. Xander hoped Buffy would talk to them later about it and let them know that getting beat was part of getting stronger.</p>\n\
    <p>For the moment though, they needed to figure out what was going on. This was the Toesocks's first big case so to speak and given the numbers and sheer size of the demons, they would need help with it.</p>\n\
    <p>Once Rebecca had finished, Buffy and Giles laid out the three R's of the Scooby standard operating procedure: Research, Reconnaissance, and more Research. There wasn't much to it really. Giles showed them how to find the most relevant books in the library then got them started flipping through the pages. Xander was on the computer with Leslie, showing her the demon sites and the database Willow had been compiling for the last year. They wouldn't do much tonight, just get a start. Tomorrow they'd check out the lair again with Buffy, do more research and then figure out where to go from there. And Rebecca and the Toesocks would ultimately be making the decisions because when they went home in the fall, they'd be on their own.</p>\n\
    <p>The phone rang somewhere in the background after they had been working for a while and a moment later someone was calling Xander's name. \"You good?\" he asked Leslie, standing when she nodded and making his way to the kitchen.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's Jack,\" Vi told him, handing him the phone.</p>\n\
    <p>Surprised and pleased, Xander said, \"Jack? Hi.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" Jack replied. \"How you doing?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good,\" said Xander. \"Tired. But good.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"All those kids running you ragged?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Running him ragged by getting ragged was more like it, Xander thought of Amy. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"It's been pretty crazy here. So what's up?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing,\" said Jack lightly. \"I just thought I'd call, see how you were doing.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander felt warm suddenly and a little surprised. \"I'm good,\" he repeated, not sure what to add. \"How are you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, I'm fine,\" said Jack. \"Stuff's been kinda hectic around here too. It's why I haven't called.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That and a complete lack of anything else to say?\" Xander asked wryly. To hell with this awkwardness. It was really starting to get annoying.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack left out a huff of a laugh. \"Yeah, that too. Unless you like hockey?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sorry,\" Xander grinned. \"Not much of a sports person.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're kidding!\" Jack sounded offended. \"How can you not like sports? Didn't you play anything when you were younger?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Did running for your life count? Xander wondered but didn't say. \"Only videogames.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, well, I guess that's something,\" said Jack. \"How do you like Super Mario?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Super Mario's cool,\" Xander responded really surprised that Jack the Colonel was asking about videogames. Wasn't he supposed to be like videogames-rot-your-mind? \"You play?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Only on my GameBoy,\" Jack sounded a little defensive. \"I get bored easily.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander laughed. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"It's just . . . I guess I'm having a hard time imagining you playing a GameBoy.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Because I'm a colonel in the Air Force? You should hear what my CO says about me,\" said Jack, making Xander chuckle again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So how long have you been in the Air Force?\" asked Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I did ROTC in college,\" said Jack. \"Ended up deciding I wanted to fly planes and go career.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Cool.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\" There was a pause as the conversation lost momentum. \"So listen,\" said Jack. \"I was wondering if you wanted to come for a visit sometime?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"With you in Colorado?\" asked Xander, surprised.</p>\n\
    <p>\"For like a weekend or something,\" Jack added. \"I understand if you don't \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" Xander interrupted before he could finish. \"I'd like that.\" It would be neat to see Jack in his own place. See what he was really like when he wasn't coping with a son from out of nowhere. It'd be really . . . neat. \"I've got to be here for the rest of the summer, but maybe in September when things calm down?\" he offered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"September,\" Jack repeated, clearly pleased. \"I'll get some leave.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay.\" Xander smiled, pleased himself, and a little excited.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll let you get back to your . . .stuff then,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah. I guess I'll talk to you later.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay, bye.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Bye.\" The phone clicked off. When Xander rejoined the others in the dining room, he was still smiling.</p>"

    <h2>
    Chapter 1: What the Frell?</h2>
    
    <p>D'argo awoke with a grunt of surprise as a solid weight landed on his chest. His hand automatically reached for his knife before his brain kicked in and opened his eyes. A fuzzy face hovered denches away from his own. The warrior relaxed and closed his eyes with a sigh, hoping he was dreaming. But when he reopened them, the grinning face of six-year-old Rhia was still two denches from his nose. Black hair, blue eyes, and crooked smile, the Human-Sebacean half-breed presented the face of purest innocence.</p>
    <p>"Morning, D'argo," the little girl giggled.</p>
    <p>"Good morning, Rhia," D'argo rumbled softly, glancing at the chronometer which told him it was definitely way too early to be awake. Why Rhia thought that every day merited a chat in the last hours of ship's night was one of the universe's great mysteries - one that D'argo wished was solved so he could go back to sleep. "Aren't you supposed to be with Chiana for two more days?"</p>
    <p>"She's asleep," Rhia told him matter of factly. D'argo stared blankly at her as he tried to follow her logic. Hadn't he just been asleep? "She said yesterday if I woke her early again I'd have to take a bath," the girl explained, eyes momentarily going wide at the horror of clean water. The Luxan couldn't help but smile.</p>
    <p>"What makes you think I won't send you to the same fate," he growled playfully, making a face. "Or worse, wash your hair?" Rhia rewarded him with a giggle - not intimidated in the least by the man who could reduce his cowering enemies to tears - and then broke into screeching laugher as his fingers attacked her ticklish sides. She tried to squirm away but D'argo held her tight, tickling under her chin and arms while he laughed with her. So he was a big softie at heart, D'argo mentally shrugged, he could think of worse things to be.</p>
    <p>After a few minutes, he let up and rolled Rhia to his side, tucking the blanket around her as she caught her breath. A giggle escaped every few minutes as she snuggled closer and D'argo smiled remembering when Jothee had been Rhia's age in those precious years when his life had been perfect. Lolhaan lying beside him when he woke to the sun streaming through the window, the smell of fresh earth with a trace of spice drifting on the breeze. Jothee in the next room innocent and unscarred.</p>
    <p>"D'argo?" Rhia interrupted his bittersweet musings. Halfway back to sleep, he looked down at his goddaughter who was twirling the corner of the blanket around her fingers. All traces of laughter were gone from her face. "When will Mama and Daddy come home?" she asked.</p>
    <p>D'argo sighed and ran a calloused palm over her hair as if it would soothe away her fears. Why did she have to ask that now? "After we get the refugees to Imosa we're going to pick them up with the next lot. Another monen, maybe," he gave her the longer estimate. The truth as usual.</p>
    <p>John and Aeryn decided early on that the best protection they could give their children in this harsh universe was knowledge. Thus every question was answered as truthfully as possible. They and the rest of the crew tried to shelter them from the worst if they could, but it was not always easy. Already, Rhia had known hunger, seen her mother kill an intruder, and spirited herself, her little brother and Chiana's adopted child to a safe room near Moya's starburst chamber where the ship herself could protect them if necessary. She knew where to kick
    or stick a knife in an attacker before disappearing into Moya's crawl spaces that the children played in daily, and where Rygel hid most of his food reserves.</p>
    <p>D'argo watched Rhia absorb the information as she continued to twist on the blanket, wishing with all his being that her childhood didn't have to be like this. But the UT's were hardly accommodating. It was unfair and cruel and no way to raise a child, but what choice did they have if they wanted to survive? Crichton called it the Law of the Jungle, though D'argo had never quite figured out what a forest had to do with it.</p>
    <p>"I wish they didn't have to go," Rhia sighed.</p>
    <p>"I know little one," the Luxan rubbed her arm, "I know. But Crais needs their help for this pickup. If all goes well they won't have to leave again for a long time."</p>
    <p>"What if it doesn't? Will they come back?" her voice dropped to a whisper.</p>
    <p>D'argo sighed again, wondering how to answer. Rhia knew that John, Aeryn, Crais and his small crew were going against the odds to a planet deep inside Scarran occupied territory. What she didn't know was that there was also a new base planet-side outfitted for wormhole and weapons research that Crais needed her parents' help to destroy.</p>
    <p>Even though the Scarran-Peacekeeper war had started shortly after Seth was born three cycles ago, wormholes hadn't been developed to a useful degree until just the last cycle. The Scarrans' research and development had been far behind that of the PK's seven cycles earlier when John and Aeryn, with the help of Crais and Talyn, had obliterated Scorpius and his scientists. Since then they had waged a guerrilla war against all wormhole tech and it had consequently been slow to re-emerge.</p>
    <p>"I can't make any promises," D'argo began, "but I'll tell you this. You are a part of your parents and they are a part of you and Seth. If you have faith in them as I do, that they will return safely, then they will know and it will help them come back unharmed."</p>
    <p>"You think they'll really come back?" Rhia twisted to face him, hope shining in her deep, blue eyes.</p>
    <p>"Yes, I do," answered D'argo seriously. He'd kill them himself if they didn't and broke her heart.</p>
    <p>They settled into a sleepy silence then, Rhia satisfied for the moment; both of them lulled by Moya's gentle hum back into dreamland, where the good guys always won.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>D'argo was almost back to sleep when Pilot's voice burst over his comm.</p>
    <p>"D'argo." His voice was agitated. "D'argo wake up."</p>
    <p>"I'm up, Pilot," the Luxan rubbed his eyes. What he wouldn't give for a full night's sleep. "What's wrong?" He gently shifted the sleeping child so he could sit up. Rhia's eyes slit open a moment before she rolled over to go back to sleep. D'argo envied her the luxury as he listened to the ship's navigator.</p>
    <p>"Moya senses something that could be a command carrier but with their new jamming signal, we can't be certain," Pilot told him.</p>
    <p>Frell. The jolt of bad news banished all thought of rest. "Who's in command?" the Luxan asked rising. He looked around briefly for his clothes, checked Rhia again and noted with satisfaction the red splattered DRD by his door - Rhia's sentinel whom she'd ingeniously named Speckles.</p>
    <p>"Filalla," Pilot continued as D'argo hurriedly dressed. "He checked the readings and agrees."</p>
    <p>"I'll be right there. Wake the others." D'argo stormed out of his quarters as quietly as possible. Frelling Peacekeepers. Could be worse, he consoled himself bitterly, could be a Scarren dreadnaught. The thought was less than comforting; carrier or dreadnaught, they would still have more firepower than Moya did.</p>
    <p>Less than a hundred microts later, D'argo stood with the rest of Moya's crew, all save Chiana who was with the children, around the strategy table listening to Pilot repeat his information.</p>
    <p>"Can we starburst?" demanded Rygel when the navigator had finished from the clamshell. To Pilot's affirmative, he added, "Then let's get the frell out of here before they know we're here."</p>
    <p>"They might already know that we are here," Filalla said somberly. He was a rather short alien with three bony legs side by side instead of two. His skin was pale, clammy, and hairless giving him a ghostly appearance at odds with his rather forceful nature. In another life he'd been a free trader until war and circumstance had landed him on Moya. D'argo found him to be a taller, more companionable version of Rygel most of the time, but like the slug, he had his moments.</p>
    <p>"All the more reason to starburst away as soon as possible," said D'argo. He looked around the table at the group that was for once in agreement by their mutual hate of the Peacekeeprs.</p>
    <p>"I'm not objecting," Jool said impatiently when his eyes lighted on her.</p>
    <p>A moment later, Pilot's voice echoed throughout the leviathan to the ship's 10 000 passengers, warning them of the immanent starburst.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Rhia awoke at Pilot's announcement, the words slowly seeping meaning into her fuzzy brain. She remembered D'argo leaving when Pilot called the first time because it had gotten colder without him, but she didn't remember why. Before she had time to puzzle it out, she heard Chiana calling her name and so went back to the Nebari's quarters half a tier away.</p>
    <p>"Why are we starbursting?" she asked as she crawled onto the bed next to Chiana. Rhia didn't like starburst much: weird things happened either before, during, or after. She glanced around the gold room warily, looking for signs of imminent disaster, and with relief didn't find any. The Nebari held her adopted son, Essor, in her lap and Seth lay asleep on Essor's bed in the corner, curled into a wad of limbs and blankets.</p>
    <p>"Peacekeeper patrol," Chiana answered shortly as the familiar buzz and lurch of starburst slid them between dimensions. Rhia felt her stomach knot up and heard a faint ringing in her ears, side affects of the incompatible space between, then the slight jolt as Moya returned to normal space.</p>
    <p>"There," said Chiana smiling to reassure Essor who was even more sensitive to starburst than Rhia. He was just a baby, two and a half, with jet-black skin covered by a pale pink fuzz that was a little thicker on his head. He didn't look anything like his species who were pale brown with white fuzz, but Rhia liked Essor's colors better. His people said he was bad luck just because he was born the day the Peacekeepers attacked their planet. When Chiana heard him crying, about to be ceremonially brained by the other refugees they'd picked up, she had immediately rescued him.</p>
    <p>Dad said motherhood had snuck up on her favorite aunt, but Rhia didn't know what that meant. Chiana had found Essor and since his parents didn't want him, it was only right Chiana keep him. Though Rhia had been put out at the time because it was one less person to play with since her stupid brother had just been born too. And the stupid refugees kept trying to kill each other so no one else could play either. But then the pirates had attacked, and she had to watch Essor and Seth and Pilot like a grownup, so she forgave them.</p>
    <p>As she watched Chiana and Essor, Rhia missed Mama and Dad more than ever. She hated it when they had to leave. It wasn't fair. Rhia was about to ask Chiana when they'd be home when, all of a sudden, Essor screamed and Moya lurched again into a starburst that shouldn't have been possible. This one lasted longer and made Rhia feel more like a scrap of flattened, wrung out laundry than a three dimensional being. Several long microts after Rhia thought she couldn't stand it any longer, she was snapped back into normal space. Essor was still screaming.</p>
    <p>"Pilot!" Chiana shouted, simultaneously cooing and trying to soothe her son. Rhia lay gasping for breath beside her, scared and confused. Across the room, Seth stared wide-eyed from the other bed, completely awake now. "What the frell just happened?"</p>
    <p>"Neither Moya nor I know what happened," Pilot answered though Rhia thought his voice didn't sound quite right. "Something...pushed us back into starburst. Moya's reserves are gone; she can barely maintain stability!"</p>
    <p>"Is she all right?" Medri's voice asked.</p>
    <p>"It will take several days at least for her strength to begin to replenish," Pilot said.</p>
    <p>"How many?" asked D'argo.</p>
    <p>"Unknown. And I don't know how far off course we are either. Moya's outer senses are acting... strange."</p>
    <p>"Are we safe?" that was Rygel.</p>
    <p>There was a pause. "It appears that no one is firing on us," Pilot finally said.</p>
    <p>The comms went silent. Rhia looked to Chiana who was rocking Essor and murmuring quietly in his ear. "Are we in trouble?" she asked quietly.</p>
    <p>Chiana looked up and smiled. "Probably no more than usual. Come on, let's get some breakfast while we still can."</p>
    <p>Shivering slightly, Rhia slid off the bed and went to her pile of clothes on the shelf. If Chiana said not to worry, she wasn't going to worry. Strange things always happened after starburst, she reminded herself to quell the rattlers flopping in her belly, and until one of the adults needed to have a Talk with her, Rhia wasn't going to be afraid. But it was still hard.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, two hundred microts later, more important things came up than weird starburts.</p>
    <p>" 'Ia!! You got it yestaday!" Seth wailed, holding on tightly to one half of the blue plate. Rhia's blue plate. The one she had painted. The one she had to *share*, now cause Seth's plate got melted.</p>
    <p>Rhia risked a brief glance at the adults to see if her cause would be championed. Today, only Jool and Medri joined Chiana and the floorfleas - Dad said they couldn't be 'rugrats' without rugs - for breakfast. Essor was firmly attached around Chiana's neck as she and yellow spotted, pale green Medri pretended to help Jool fix the ellka roots. For the moment, none of them were paying attention.</p>
    <p>"No, you did! It's my turn today!" Rhia, grasping the other half with her right hand, started to pry her brother's fingers up one by one. Just 'cause he was the youngest, everything had to be *his* way.</p>
    <p>"But you *a'ways* get it! It's *my* turn!" Seth plopped his fingers right back down. " 'Ia, let go!"</p>
    <p>"But it's *my* turn!"</p>
    <p>Suddenly the plate was plucked from their scrabbling fingers. Rhia looked up and saw Jool with the painted, metal plate and a displeased expression on her face. "It doesn't matter what color plate you eat off of, the food still tastes the same," she told them briskly, then turned and handed them both plain gray dishes.</p>
    <p>"But the blue plate's *my* plate!" Rhia whined, turning up the injured innocence.</p>
    <p>"Then next time you'll think twice before sticking Seth's plate in the oven," said Jool. "Now sit down. The roots are almost done."</p>
    <p>But it was *her* plate, Rhia thought angrily. "It's your fault," she whispered to Seth as they walked to their places at the table.</p>
    <p>"Is not!"</p>
    <p>"Is too!"</p>
    <p>"Is not!"</p>
    <p>"Hey, that's enough!" said Jool loudly, but impassioned by the righteousness of their causes, neither one of them listened.</p>
    <p>"Is too!" Rhia yelled.</p>
    <p>"Is not!" Seth screamed back.</p>
    <p>"Is too!"</p>
    <p>"Not another word or you'll both be spending the next weeken with Rygel!" Chiana shouted.</p>
    <p>They shut up. Rygel was never any fun. And he smelled funny which would make them smell funny which would mean a bath every day, a fate worse than losing the blue plate. Rhia glowered at Chiana and slumped over her ugly, plain, *gray* plate, depressed. Food never tasted as good on the gray ones, no matter what the grownups said.</p>
    <p>It was so unfair! Everyone always wanted to stop Rhia from having any fun. Sometimes her aunts and uncles would play with her or Seth but something *always* came up that would take them away after only a little while. Rhia liked it best when she got to help fix Moya's systems, or when Mama played Escape the Intruder, or when Dad told stories.</p>
    <p>But most of the time she had to play alone or with the boys. And that wasn't as fun sometimes because they always messed everything up. Rhia had made friends with some of the refugee children on earlier runs, but they always had to leave eventually, and sometimes their parents didn't want their children talking with her because she was Sebacean. Dad had tried to explain that the Peacekeepers had hurt them and they had lost their homes and were now afraid, but Rhia didn't really understand. She had never done anything to them, so why should they hate her? She remembered one irate mother had knocked her down with a walking stick and called her the plague of the universe. Rhia had never gone back.</p>
    <p>Her sad thoughts were interrupted when the three adults sat down at the table, Jool between Rhia and her brother, and Chiana and Medri on either side of Essor across from them.</p>
    <p>"When a' we getting new food?" Seth asked when Jool dished boiled ellka roots onto his plate. Rhia regarded her own boiled roots with distaste, wondering when the last was that she had eaten anything different. They'd had scallips and tenga meat when Mom and Dad had left just after a supply run a monen ago. But when they had to feed 10 000 people, food vanished quickly. It seemed like the grownups were always talking about food: how long it would last, when they needed more, how much was left.</p>
    <p>Rhia picked up a boiled root with her fingers. They really weren't that bad, and unlike other foods they were easy to cook different ways so there was a little variety. They looked like shriveled tongues when they were boiled and had a slight crunch to them. It wasn't until she popped the root in her mouth that Rhia noticed the Significant Looks the three adults were exchanging.</p>
    <p>"As soon as we reach the next commerce planet," Medri finally replied to Seth's question.</p>
    <p>"Oh," Seth stared at the root in his hand then took a bite and chewed. "When's that?" he asked through a mouthful.</p>
    <p>"Soon we hope," said Chiana.</p>
    <p>"But Moya's sick," said Rhia remembering Pilot's 'wrong' voice.</p>
    <p>"Not sick, just tired," Medri shook his head. "She should be fine in a couple days. Pilot says she just needs rest right now."</p>
    <p>"I like 'em betta with sauce," said Seth, ignoring this last exchange.</p>
    <p>"Which sauce? The red or the orange?" asked Chiana.</p>
    <p>"Red, Chi!" Seth looked up and grinned. Flecks of white mush decorated his gums and lips.</p>
    <p>Chiana grinned back; the red sauce was the one she made. "You have exquisite taste, young sir!" she told him in her best imitation of Rygel. Seth giggled.</p>
    <p>Jealous of the attention Rhia said, "I like the red, too."</p>
    <p>"And what's wrong with my orange sauce?" Jool demanded. "It's much better with these roots than that other muck."</p>
    <p>" 'Muck'?!" Chiana sat up straighter, her eyes flashing dangerously. "You're calling *my* cooking 'muck'?!"</p>
    <p>"You call it 'cooking'?"</p>
    <p>Chiana threw a root at her, eliciting a surprised shriek from the Interion. "I can cook anything in this universe, princess, unlike *some* people who don't know which end of a carren bird to stuff!"</p>
    <p>Jool answered with an ellka root of her own, hitting Chiana square in the face. Rhia giggled at the Nebari's outraged expression and joined in the fun.</p>
    <p>"Rhia!" said Chiana in surprise when the second root hit her shoulder. Then the food fight began in earnest. Roots flew across the table thick and fast, some landing on their marks, others whizzing by to bounce off the walls. Rhia squealed as one hit her arm, clammy and warm, and immediately threw it back across the table, giggling again at Medri's yelp of surprise. She liked this game.</p>
    <p>But, much to the kids' disappointment, it ended all to soon when Rygel's voice crackled over the comms. "D'argo, anybody, get down here! They're trying to kill me, the yotzes!"</p>
    <p>There was a moment of startled silence in the center chamber before the three grownups surged to their feet. Rhia sighed. Another game ruined by the refugees. She watched sadly as Medri ran out with Jool following close on his heels. Chi dropped to a knee and gave Essor a quick hug before turning her deep black eyes to Rhia.</p>
    <p>"I want you three to stay here and start cleaning up, all right?" she looked in turn at Seth and Essor before moving back to Rhia. The little girl already knew what she was going to say. "If anything happens -"</p>
    <p>"Disappear into the access conduits," Rhia finished, desperately hoping it wouldn't come to that. Echoes of the two days the floorfleas had spent hiding from a refugee mob that had taken over Moya filled her head and made her belly flop.</p>
    <p>"Good girl." Chiana dropped a quick kiss on her forehead then ran out to help save Rygel. Again.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>On his way to the upper cargo bay, Medri took a detour by his quarters to pick up his pulse rifle. Like most of Moya's crew, he already had a pulse pistol strapped to his thigh, but he'd learned the hard way that one could never have too many weapons when dealing with the refugees. He barely glanced at the weapon as he snatched it from the shelf in his sparse quarters before dashing back down the corridor.</p>
    <p>D'argo met him at the junction of the main tier and from the set of his jaw, he was far from happy. "I hate it when this happens," the warrior growled.</p>
    <p>Medri gave him a sardonic grin. "Our thanks for saving their sorry asses in the first place." D'argo barely glanced at him as Rygel's agitated voice interrupted.</p>
    <p>"Help! They're climbing the walls!! Pilot send in some DRDs, anything!" The dominar's voice was almost drowned by the shouting in the background.</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid they've incapacitated the DRDs already present," said Pilot.</p>
    <p>"Rygel, we're almost there. Just avoid them for a few more microts," said D'argo.</p>
    <p>"That's easy for you to say, you brute. Just make sure you have lots of weapons! Ahhhhggg!! You yotz!!"</p>
    <p>By unspoken agreement, Medri and D'argo increased their pace. Jool was waiting at the cargo bay doors when they arrived. From the other side, they heard the shouting and screaming of hundreds of angry voices demanding food and control of the ship. So far the refugees hadn't made it through the locked door or discovered the access conduits that, though blocked, would succumb to a nimble tech or thief.</p>
    <p>Medri put his ear to the door while D'argo checked in with the other three members of the crew still on the way. He heard too much shouting for there to be one mob leader; it was too disjointed. The spotted young man shook his head at the irony of the situation. He, who had been a professional at inciting mass riots against the Blue Government on his homeworld, was now desperately trying to stop one.</p>
    <p>"Chiana and Filalla are almost here, Emmerit's still three tiers away," D'argo informed him as he rejoined the other two. Jool was nervous, her eyes slightly larger than normal, and D'argo looked on the verge of hyper rage. All three of them had their weapons primed.</p>
    <p>"They're not organized yet," Medri said, nodding at the door over his shoulder. "If we hit now, we can probably stop it before it gets nasty."</p>
    <p>"Just the three of us?" Jool squeaked. "There's almost four hundred people in there. I could make a sleep agent..."</p>
    <p>"Because that worked *so* well last time," D'argo cut in.</p>
    <p>"We have to go now!" Medri repeated, his whole body taught with tension. He let out a slow breath when D'argo nodded in agreement.</p>
    <p>"Filalla," D'argo said into his comm, "you and Chiana will have to hold the hallway." He checked to make sure they were ready, then said, "Pilot, open the door."</p>
    <p>"We need a better plan than this!" Jool moaned, even as she shifted her grip on her rifle. Medri shook his head at her, marveling at the Interion's duality. Always the first one to advocate reason and talking out conflict, she nonetheless had a vicious streak that could lay an enemy low. "Why am I always the first one in!" But her whining was constant.</p>
    <p>"Shut up and scream!" D'argo told her.</p>
    <p>The oval door swung open onto every rebel's dream: a mob of angry people just waiting to explode. Most of the cloth partitions that separated sleeping places had been knocked down, bars and whatever other furniture they could find had been broken into makeshift weapons.</p>
    <p>"The door! To the door!" one of the rose skinned, red-eyed Hedogens shouted hysterically, pointing. There was a surge as half the refugees turned, even as other voices shouted, "No! No! Stop! This isn't right!" Above and to the left, Rygel floated on his throne-sled, dodging missiles and the three Hedogens who'd climbed up a pile of crates after him.</p>
    <p>All this Medri and his crewmates took in in a microt, before instantly bursting into action. Jool screamed, doubling over the mob with the metal melting sound even as Medri dropped the mob leader and D'argo the three after Rygel in quick, deadly succession. The silence was absolute when Jool finally closed her mouth. The Hedogens, many still grasping their ears, stared jaw-dropped at first their fallen leader then the three, armed aliens by door. Medri couldn't help but grin in pride. No one would be taking over the ship today.</p>
    <p>"Well it's about time!" Rygel snapped as he zoomed down to them. "What took you so long?!"</p>
    <p>D'argo darted a glance at the dominar, weapon still trained one the silent crowd, then asked, "What happened?"</p>
    <p>"I was simply informing their frelling council of the situation when that idiot," he pointed at the male Medri shot, "started shouting about a Peacekeeper conspiracy and tried to kill me."</p>
    <p>The crowd shifted uncomfortably under the crew's combined glare like guilty children, so lost and scared that Medri couldn't help but feel for them a little. It was little wonder they were scared and scrabbling for some kind of control. Fled onto an unknown ship that had appeared out of nowhere when their homes were being shelled by the Peacekeepers - or Scarrens, he couldn't remember which - families lost, only the clothes on their backs and the memories of a civilization now broken, and headed for a foreign planet. And worse, their precarious fate entrusted to a small, mismatched group of aliens, two of them Sebacean, with more legend around them than truth. Medri saw the fear of the uncertain in their sad red eyes, fear of losing what precious little was left they had to live for.</p>
    <p>"Why are you starving us?" a woman's voice quavered from the middle of the mob. Medri couldn't see from whom, but the question echoed in the faces of the others.</p>
    <p>"Oh, right. We just give them food 'cause we want to watch them not eat it," Chiana's sarcasm announced her presence behind them.</p>
    <p>"Where are you taking us? What happened in starburst?" the questions kept pouring out desperately, louder and louder until Medri thought his eardrums would explode. "You better tell us!" one young male near the front shouted,
    shaking his fist. His skin was two shades darker red than those around him, making him stand out. "You better tell us or -"</p>
    <p>"Or you'll what?" Medri shouted back suddenly angry at their threats. Yes, they were scared, they might have lost their home, but damned if he was going to let them take his and get them all killed by the first PK's who showed up. These people had been rockbound their whole lives and didn't have a frelling clue what they risked to keep them alive. "Take over the ship? A leviathan you have no idea how to run with a Pilot that will be against you? And then what? Pick up all the food that's just *floating* in the middle of space?" Medri stared the youth until the Hedogen broke away, then swept his eyes over the rest of the mob. They gaped back, eyes calmer and no longer in the frenzy of incited passion and fear. They were listening to him. Good, they needed a reality check. "We've been transporting refugees to safety for cycles with more success than failure. We know the Uncharted Territories. Now we can do this two ways. You can do like a handful of refugee groups did before, and *try* to take over the ship..."</p>
    <p>"But that didn't work out so well for them," Chiana piped up grinning evilly.</p>
    <p>"Ahh, the screams as we flushed them out of the airlock, hmm, hmmm, hm," Rygel chuckled, closing his eyes as if to savor the 'memory'. Though knowing Rygel, it was probably one of his daydreams.</p>
    <p>The Hedogens shuffled nervously, not liking the sound of option one. "Or," Medri continued, "we can inform your council of what's going on, so they can tell you - wait, wasn't that just what Rygel was trying to do when you attacked him?"</p>
    <p>"We don't like being attacked," D'argo added with just enough menace in his voice to cause the crowd to pull into itself, away from the bodies on the floor. "Now if you prefer to do it our way, let Rygel talk to your council and the rest of you go back to what you were doing." Grudgingly it seemed, the Hedogens dispersed, leaving Moya's crew at the door.</p>
    <p>"That was close," Jool sighed, letting her rifle dangle loosely from her fingers.</p>
    <p>"Frelling idiots," Medri groused. "Think they can just make it on their own."</p>
    <p>Emmerit nodded in agreement and slid her pistol back into its holster. "I'm getting too old for this," she said and Medri couldn't help but snort in dry amusement with the others. However old Emmerit claimed to be, she was still as spry as a youth.</p>
    <p>"Come on," said D'argo. "We better go check on the other groups before they try to kill us too."</p>
    <p>"I am not staying here without a bodyguard!" Rygel interrupted the general move towards the oval door.</p>
    <p>"Rygel -" D'argo started, but Medri laid a restraining hand on his arm.</p>
    <p>"I'll stay. It'll remind them that we're the ones in control here."</p>
    <p>D'argo nodded once. "Fine. When you're done tell Pilot. We still have a lot of repairs to do." The Luxan turned and followed Emmerit, Jool, and Filalla out the door. Chiana however sidled up to Medri.</p>
    <p>"You were magnificent - reminded me of the first time we met," she whispered, though much to Medri's disappointment that's all she did. With a wink and smile that dropped Medri's spots four shades of yellow, the Nebari slowly turned and left the cargo bay.</p>
    <p>"Medri!" Dren, he couldn't wait till D'argo took the kids.</p>
    <p>"I'm coming, Ryg." Reluctantly he turned away from Chiana's retreating backside and followed the floating dominar.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 2: What the Hell?</h2>
    
    <p>The Earth was beautiful. Commander Jason Klee never tired of the view. Every time he passed a window, he always took a moment to look at the blue and white orb, floating so innocently outside the International Space Station's window. From 400 kilometers up, she looked so peaceful, as if the bubbling conflicts on her surface were no more annoying than a couple of itches that would soon go away.</p>
    <p>Jason smiled to himself as his thoughts turned poetic and pushed off the wall under the window of the crew's common room towards the hatch that led to the rest of the station. Time to pull his head out of the clouds so to speak, and start thinking about the telescope realignment at 15:00.</p>
    <p>"Hey, Jason."</p>
    <p>"Hi, Eric," Jason reached his right hand to the wall to avoid a collision with his incoming German engineer. "I didn't catch you at breakfast. Any more problems sleeping?" he asked.</p>
    <p>The black haired man waved a dismissing hand. "No. Becky gave me half of a sleeping pill. Once I was asleep I was fine."</p>
    <p>"Good," Jason smiled. "Wouldn't want you to conk out while you're EVA."</p>
    <p>"Not likely," Eric answered, giving a push and floating to his locker nearby. "No way in hell I'm missing a minute - "</p>
    <p>"Commander Klee, could you please come to the command cell," Rita Masson's voice issued through the Space Station's intercom system. Jason exchanged a puzzled look with Eric as he pushed himself toward the communications panel on the opposite wall.</p>
    <p>"Klee here, in the crew quarters. What's the problem?"</p>
    <p>There was a pause then Rita said, "I'm not sure but you really need to see this."</p>
    <p>"I'm on my way." With a last glance at Eric, Jason kicked himself through the hatch at a faster than safe speed, legs trailing behind him like Superman flying through a maze. Within two minutes he was in the command cell with a hand on the bulkhead keeping him oriented 'upright' in the zero G.</p>
    <p>"What's going on?" he asked the rooms two occupants, Rita in front of the main panel that controlled most of the stations external functions, and Brian Santi plastered to the window above on the right.</p>
    <p>Rita turned away from the radar, her expression calm and professional, though Jason thought he saw a glitter in her eyes that might or might not have been her heart thumping a thousand times too fast. "Take a look at this," she said, moving aside and pointing at the radar. A rather large blip flashed periodically where there shouldn't have been a blip. Jason stared at the monitor, mind blanking out for a second. Despite his poetic tendencies, Jason was a scientist through and through, a scientist who knew that the radar should have spotted something that large well before it got between the orbits of Earth and Venus. He was about to ask if there had been any problems recently with the equipment when Brian let out a surprised gasp.</p>
    <p>"I see something," the youngest member of the station's crew breathed. Rita and Jason immediately joined him at the window. "It's about 15 degrees below the horizontal. Gold." It took a moment for Jason to find it, a gold star slightly larger than those glittering diamond.</p>
    <p>"What the hell is it?" asked Rita. Stunned, no one answered.</p>
    <p>Snapping back to himself, the practical side of Jason took charge. Shoving back into the open area he began giving orders. "Ok, first thing, Rita, alert the crew. Second, get every instrument we have tracking that thing. Brian, I want you to get a line down to Canaveral and Houston. Rita, what time did that thing appear?"</p>
    <p>"13:18," she answered switching on the station's intercom.</p>
    <p>Jason barely heard her alerting the crew. His mind was racing, asking questions, wondering what that speck of gold was. 376 AD, July 4th 1776, December 7th 1941, September 11th 2001, 13:18 April 5th 2010. Jason had feeling this was another date he wasn't going to forget.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The small workroom on the third floor of the Shepherd Building was abuzz with activity when the call came in. In fact, the small group of engineers and two astronauts barely looked up when the phone rang. They had more pressing matters to worry about, like how much farther the Slingshot Maneuver would take the manned Farscape III carrying enough fuel to get home, and how much exactly 'enough' was. But when DK, the leader of the Farscape Project, let out a strangled "WHAT?!" all movement and conversation ceased.</p>
    <p>"Are you serious?" DK said into the phone then glanced up at his team who were listening hard. "We'll be right over!" he finally said and hung up. At first he didn't say anything, just stared back at his waiting colleagues with a slightly stunned expression on his face. "Something," he took a deep breath. "Something showed up on the Space Station radar about half an hour ago. Something big between Earth and Venus. ISS got a visual. It's big and gold and not natural." Suddenly there was a huge grin on his face. "We've been invited to the SSC."</p>
    <p>The Farscape team stared back. "Oh my God!" breathed Yora Maganova. A minute later the workroom was empty, a fluttering piece of paper drifted to the floor in the wake of the excited scientists.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>"So you're telling me that the Saudis are getting ready to pull out?" President Landers regarded the three serious men facing him. Two of them wore the dress uniforms of generals, the third on the right was in a dark gray suit. None of them were smiling.</p>
    <p>Sighing, the president stood and crossed the Oval Office to his desk to stretch his legs. Just what they needed right now, one of their Muslim nations to back out of the treaty. If Saudi Arabia didn't sign there was no way Pakistan would.</p>
    <p>"So, Andrew, what's your take on this?" he asked his Secretary of State. Leaning against the desk, he rubbed his eyes under the rim of his glasses. A couple of Excedrin would have been really good about five minutes ago.</p>
    <p>The man in the gray suit, flipped through the folder on his lap and pulled out a piece of paper, but before he could open his mouth the phone rang. Hissing in annoyance, Landers reached behind himself for the phone and answered.</p>
    <p>"This better be good," he snapped.</p>
    <p>"Sorry to disturb you, Mr. President," Landers' aide said, the customary apology a tad too excited, "but the director of IASA, Phil Oursler, is on line two."</p>
    <p>"NASA?"</p>
    <p>"Um, I-ASA, sir. The space program went international around the turn of the century."</p>
    <p>"Oh. What the hell does he want that can't wait till later?"</p>
    <p>"He asked to tell you himself, sir. Trust me, you want to take this."</p>
    <p>"I want to take this?" Landers was skeptical.</p>
    <p>"You *want* to take this," his aide repeated. Great.</p>
    <p>"Fine. Thanks." Sighing again, Landers shifted on the desk so he could reach the buttons on the phone. "Excuse me, gentlemen, this will only take a minute," he said to the waiting men. He glanced at the clock on the wall as Oursler introduced himself: 1:53. Damn, he'd missed lunch again.</p>
    <p>"Mr. President," Oursler intoned once they finished with the pleasantries, "the International Space Station picked up a signal on radar between the orbits of Venus and Earth at 1:18 today. They got a confirmed sighting."</p>
    <p>Landers knew he was missing something important here, other than the Saudis that is. "And?"</p>
    <p>"Mr. President, we think we have an alien ship out there."</p>
    <p>Maybe his sanity too. "A what?"</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Space Station Control was in a state of controlled chaos that had perhaps sprung a few leaks at the seams. In addition to the team on watch, support teams had been called in to help monitor and analyze the data pouring into the room from the Space Station, the satellites, and the various space observation centers around the globe, as precious little of it as there was.</p>
    <p>DK glanced around the busy room then back to the central monitor that held the image of the golden ship. Truth was, whether they were needed or not, no one in the room could stay away. Not with *that* out there. Waiting.</p>
    <p>"DK, you're drooling," his friend and colleague Yora Maganova came up and pressed a cup of coffee into his hand.</p>
    <p>"Bite me," he smiled down at the petite brunette, the remarkable young woman who had revived the Farscape Project five years after John had flown his last mission.</p>
    <p>"Much as I'd like to, I actually came to tell you the briefing starts at three. Tony wants us there," she said lightly.</p>
    <p>"Government finally show up?"</p>
    <p>"Brass, bigwigs, and butter knuckles," Yora grinned. At DK's puzzle look she added, "something my dad used to say."</p>
    <p>" 'Butter knuckles'?" DK asked chuckling.</p>
    <p>"You know, butter their knuckles and the rings slip right off," Yora told him with a pantomime. "Come on, we don't want to be late."</p>
    <p>Still grinning, DK followed Yora to the large conference room upstairs that was already packed to the gills. Every seat was taken and chairs had been added on the sides. Half of the Maroon team who'd been on watch, various engineers and astronauts, government suits, and the First Contact Team filled every available space. Commander Klee from the Space Station and Peter Clark from the main SETI dishes in the Caribbean were both on the computer screen at the end of the table.</p>
    <p>The briefing revealed very little information about their unknown visitors, and none of it was new for over half of the audience. At 13:18 one of the Space Station's cameras picked up a flash of light. Two point four seconds later the gold ship appeared on radar on the Space Station, in the SSC, and on various other space monitoring stations in the Western Hemisphere. Since its mysterious arrival the ship had been drifting about halfway between the orbits of Venus and Earth but no signals had yet been sent.</p>
    <p>"So now the question is," said Tony Prow, Maroon Team's Flight Director who was running the show, "what do we do now?"</p>
    <p>"Isn't that obvious?" asked Jeremy Seymore, head of the First Contact Team. "We follow first contact procedure and send them the prime number signal!" DK smiled at his enthusiasm, and he wasn't the only one. Hell, half the people in the room wanted to get right to the talking.</p>
    <p>The government men, and one woman DK noted, looked less than thrilled. "How do we know they aren't a threat to us?" one of them asked.</p>
    <p>"We don't," was Jeremy's bubbling reply. "It could be another Independence Day scenario for all we know. But they could be peaceful. And we'll never know unless we contact them. I've spent the last hour talking to the other members of the First Contact Commission all over the world and that's our recommendation."</p>
    <p>"Besides, how would we stop an attack from space anyway?" one of the other engineers DK didn't know spoke up reasonably. "We have no global defense system. Our best bet is to establish ourselves as a peaceful planet."</p>
    <p>DK heard a couple of derisive snorts from the background at the last comment, and sadly enough had to agree. He could see it now: yes, Mr. Alien were peaceful. We only like to kill members of our *own* species who are different from us. God, when had he gotten so cynical?</p>
    <p>"What choice do we have?" Daniel Bradley, one of the astronauts, added. "They're gonna notice us sooner or later. Make me feel better if we contact them while they're still a ways out." Others murmured in agreement.</p>
    <p>The government types didn't really put up much of an argument; they probably hadn't been planning on shutting Earth's figurative mouth anyway. A few more minutes of discussion and several international telephone calls later, 16:00 was set for the PNS transmission, giving them just under an hour. DK left then with a dozen others wanting to get a good seat in the control room, leaving the haggling over who would represent Earth for her first contact with an alien race.</p>
    <p>"So, you having kittens yet?" Yora joined him in the hallway. DK laughed and let loose some of the tension he hadn't realized had built up in his system.</p>
    <p>" 'Rattlers' is what the colonel used to say," he smiled thinking of John's dad. "It's just real all of a sudden, you know?" He looked intently at his friend and from the gleam in her eye knew that she understood what he couldn't quite say. Aliens. God, John would have loved this. Mixed in with the thrill of the discovery, DK felt a twinge of regret and pain that his friend wasn't here to share this with.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Sometimes Shannon Lucas hated her job. Take this morning for instance. She'd woken up with the knowledge that because of a minor in geology and a difference in opinion with her boss, she had been reassigned as WWSK6's new IASA correspondent. In newscaster's lingo, she was Sleeping on Canaveral, the most unsought after assignment there was. IASA, like NASA before, kept an open channel for the media, the catch was that her boss thought one had to actually be on site to listen to the minding numbing, incomprehensible conversation between the geeks in Space Station Control and the braver geeks in the actual Space Station. So it was no wonder that sometimes Shannon hated her job.</p>
    <p>Then there was now when she couldn't stop thanking whatever bad luck she had that got her posted to this - former - journalistic wasteland. Shannon had struck gold. Or rather the Space Station's radar had. Shannon had returned from a rather late lunch to find the Kennedy Space Center in an uproar and it hadn't taken her long to figure out why.</p>
    <p>The story had actually broken about around two o'clock, when the White House and State Department suddenly started making calls to the UN, NSA, and the EU. Shannon had only been too happy to confirm the rumors flying around Washington.</p>
    <p>"You ready to go?" her cameraman asked from the other side of the tripod. Shannon grinned at him and straightened her shoulders.</p>
    <p>"Anytime, David," she answered.</p>
    <p>David started the countdown with his left hand while Shannon smiled broadly for the camera, waiting for the little voice in her ear that would tell her when to speak. She didn't have long to wait. "And now we take you live to Shannon Lucas at the Kennedy Space Center."</p>
    <p>"Thanks Debra," said Shannon to the anchor in Orlando. "I'm standing just outside the Kennedy Space Center, home of Space Station Control where less than three hours ago, at 1:18 PM, the International Space Station reported an unidentified object between the orbits of Earth and Venus on radar. Since then, reports have been coming in from monitoring sites all over the nation confirming the presence of an alien craft. As we speak, the International First Contact Commission is transmitting the Prime Number Sequence to the alien ship in an effort to establish peaceful contact. The sequence is composed of prime numbers, which are the numbers that are only divisible by one and themselves and a mathematical truth that the alien ship should recognize. Representatives from the State Department and the United Nations are standing by for a return signal."</p>
    <p>"When will know the outcome of the signal?"</p>
    <p>"No one knows for certain," Shannon reported. "Because of the distances involved, there will be at least a thirty second delay between transmission and reception of the signal. Now all we can do is wait."</p>
    <p>"Thank you Shannon. We will definitely check back with you later," Debra's voice switched off and David stopped rolling film.</p>
    <p>Shannon glanced back at the building where all the excitement was taking place. The parking lot was already filled with news vans and staff stuck on the outside with no space left in the pressroom. Waiting.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 3: Isn't that...?</h2><p>Chiana twisted the bolt as tightly as she could, trying to ignore Filalla's cursing in the background. He was pretty tenacious when it came to swearing, inventing new and rather creative insults in about fifteen languages that the prudish microbes refused to translate. Of course, there were only a few Chiana didn't know. But as dirty as her mouth was, the Nebari did have her limits as to how much she could listen too.</p>
    <p>"Just break the frelling thing already!" she snapped then grunted as at last the bolt crunched against the backing, assuring that the cable wouldn't slip out again anytime soon.</p>
    <p>"I thought the point was to *repair* Moya's fried circuits," Filalla snapped back snidely. "How can I do that if my tools are broken?"</p>
    <p>"Since you're doing such a wonderful job not hurting yourself," Chiana retorted, finally turning from the panel she'd been working on. She stood on one side of the neural nexus, extra fiberwire littered the floor around her feet. Filalla was working two panels to the left separating melted wires with a sort of heated knife that was doing more damage to him than the wires.</p>
    <p>The three-legged man glared at her, blisters bright blue on his pale, unlucky fingers. "I'd like to see you do better," he retorted.</p>
    <p>Chiana rolled her eyes and turned back to her cables that would, hopefully, with Filalla's wires straightened out, get Moya's external sensors at least functioning. She heard a plastic crackle behind her as Fil inspected the diagram of what his melted mess should look like, then the buzz of the hot knife as he got back to work.</p>
    <p>"Goddamned gazonian wiskerbot!!"</p>
    <p>Chiana just shook her head and focused on the cables. There was just no changing some people. Thus the Nebari suffered through Filalla's indelicate language as they repaired the relay. After securing the last cable, she stepped over to see how he was coming along.</p>
    <p>"You know," Fil interrupted his tirade when he noticed her over his shoulder. "When I first came on Moya I knew less than a welnitz about tech work. Now look at me, better than my own frelling mechanics," he chuckled dryly. He pulled back and looked at the diagram again. "I just have to switch a couple connections and I think we'll have it." He looked over his shoulder at Chiana and grinned in sudden pride. "Kinda fun isn't it?" he said. The Nebari just rolled her eyes.</p>
    <p>A few microts later the relay was fixed. Or so Chiana hoped. "Pilot? We think we got the first array put back together. Moya picking up anything?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," came Pilot's answer over the comm. "It is weak but more than we had before."</p>
    <p>"Any idea where we are?" Fil asked as he sat down on the ledge that surrounded the central ladder, pulling his leftmost leg up under his arms.</p>
    <p>"A solar system. Possibly planets. You'll have to repair at least the second array before Moya can get stronger readings."</p>
    <p>"We're on it, Pilot," Filalla sighed and rose. Chiana helped him move their equipment to the next two panels. The second array didn't take nearly as long as the first to fix, which made Chiana happy because she only had to listen to Filalla swear for half the time. One would think three-legs would have gotten the hang of the hot knife by now, but no, he was still burning himself as if he *wanted* the blisters. Although Chiana thought it was more to have something to yell at than anything.</p>
    <p>"Ok, Pilot," she called when they'd finished. Fil inspected his poor hands while they waited for Pilot's response. "You better have Jool look at those," she told him earning herself another glare. But before he could reply with a suitably scathing remark, Pilot came back.</p>
    <p>"Moya's readings are much clearer now," he said. "We're in a solar system between two planets."</p>
    <p>"And?" Jool's voice floated over the comms, impatient as usual.</p>
    <p>"One of them appears habitated," their navigator offered.</p>
    <p>Habitated. Chiana glanced at Filalla seeing her worry reflected in his face. "Any idea where we are?" he asked again.</p>
    <p>"I've been going over the vectors from the starburst, but it will take a while longer to find our relative position. Moya is still...unsettled."</p>
    <p>"I'm almost finished with tier sixteen," Medri's voice echoed over the comm - he was probably the inside a wall. "Chi, if you go ahead and start on the third relay, we'll probably be done at the same time."</p>
    <p>"Pilot, what about that planet?" D'argo broke in. "Any sign of Scarren or PK activity?"</p>
    <p>"Moya is having trouble sorting through the signals. Wait..." said Pilot. He paused and there was silence. Chiana found herself holding her breath, just knowing she didn't want to hear him say it because - "There's...one signal that is... aimed at us!" - it was always bad news.</p>
    <p>"Frell!" the Nebari joined the chorus. "Defense screen!" D'argo yelled, catalyzing Chiana and Filalla into action on the opposite side of the neural nexus.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>"Pilot, does the signal have words with it?" D'argo demanded even as he and Jool got to work powering up the defense screen in command. Of course, until Chiana and Filalla plugged it into Moya, it was useless.</p>
    <p>"No, it is a series of tones...audio only," Pilot told him from the clamshell. A moment later, a repetitive beeping echoed through the room: "...beep beep beep...beep beep beep beep beep... beep beep beep beep beep beep beep..."</p>
    <p>"They get longer then start short again," Pilot said over the mechanical tones.</p>
    <p>"I do not like the sound of that," Jool said. D'argo couldn't agree more. Frantically, he tried to get his fingers to move faster connecting wires, cursing in ancient Luxan when he realized he'd wired the pattern of an older model. Like all the defense screens they'd gone through over the cycles, this one had been scavenged from a defunct vessel and was, as John noted, in remarkably better shape then many of their previous ones. And as Aeryn had pointed out, that wasn't saying much.</p>
    <p>"Can we see what's trying to kill us yet?" the Luxan asked, redoing the circuits.</p>
    <p>"You'll have to do it from command," Pilot told him. "The signal is coming from the planet's surface." Jool immediately rushed over to the right-hand consol, and a microt later, a fuzzy picture formed on the view screen.</p>
    <p>"Defense screen's hooked up," Chiana panted over the comm. D'argo flipped on the power and felt the hum as the screen spluttered to dubious life around them. Feeling slightly better, the Luxan finally took a look at the cause of his heart attacks, and blinked. Hadn't he been here before?</p>
    <p>"Haven't we been here before?" he asked Jool who gave him a strange look that clearly meant no. D'argo shook his head, maybe it was just him. But...</p>
    <p>"There has been no change in the signal," said Pilot.</p>
    <p>And then D'argo thought he had it, but the name slipped away again. He'd been a prisoner there with Rygel. A long time ago. Aeryn had been there too; they'd gone after John...Frell.</p>
    <p>"Rygel, can you come up to command?" he said impatiently, both hoping and dreading he was right. "We have the planet on visual."</p>
    <p>Filalla and Chiana were actually the first to arrive, the Nebari stopping dead in her tracks when she saw the planet. D'argo glanced back and saw her open her mouth twice and raise a hesitant finger.</p>
    <p>"Isn't that...?"</p>
    <p>"Crichton's planet," Rygel breathed coming up behind her, eyes wide in surprise.</p>
    <p>"WHAT?" Filalla and Jool exclaimed together, looking back and forth among the three.</p>
    <p>"What what?" asked Emmerit pushing past the stunned Nebari who was still gaping at the little planet. D'argo couldn't blame her, since he felt the same way. John had practically given up searching for his homeworld cycles ago when he'd gone after Scorpius, destroying the very technology that could take him home. And now here they were. Wherever here was.</p>
    <p>"Pilot, how long till Moya can get us the frell away from here?!" Rygel demanded.</p>
    <p>"Our situation has not greatly changed," Pilot informed them.</p>
    <p>"Then we have no choice. We're almost out of food," said Emmerit. D'argo turned with the others to stare at her.</p>
    <p>"No choice?! They imprisoned me!" Rygel sputtered.</p>
    <p>"Frell," D'argo muttered. Just once, he wanted an option that wasn't likely to be fatal. "Chiana, are they going to kill us?"</p>
    <p>The pale woman shrugged her shoulders. "My heaving gut says I'm still in shock."</p>
    <p>"If it's trade with them or starve, I'm for trading," said Jool. "Besides we still don't know if that frelling signal is targeting us or just their concept of music."</p>
    <p>"That's not music," said Filalla.</p>
    <p>"Have you heard John sing?" Jool replied.</p>
    <p>"All for finding out if were going to be atomized? Good," D'argo cut in, not giving anyone a chance to reply; Rygel's protests were quickly clamped off by Chiana's hand over his mouth. "Pilot, let's talk to them."</p>
    <p>"Just a moment. I have to reconfigure the transmission for their... systems." There was a pause, then Pilot looked up. "Moya is connected to the source of the signal."</p>
    <p>D'argo turned to the blue planet on the viewscreen and said in his commanding voice, "I am Ka D'argo of the Leviathan Moya. What is the meaning of the signal directed at us?"</p>
    <p>"So much for diplomacy," he heard Jool mutter behind him. D'argo glared at her - frell diplomacy, that was Rygel's job.</p>
    <p>They waited in nervous silence for a reply. Microts stretched out longer and longer until time itself seemed on the point of breaking. Erp stared back at them, mocking their helplessness against a primitive planet.</p>
    <p>"Chiana-"</p>
    <p>"I don't know!" she snapped back.</p>
    <p>"Attention," said Pilot. "We are receiving return audio and visual." A microt later a crackling image clarified on the viewscreen revealing three Humans in coats and white shirts. All three appeared male, the two on the sides rather reserved, but the central one was clearly excited.</p>
    <p>"Hello," said the one in the middle. "Welcome to Earth." A big smile plastered itself across his face and, tension broken, D'argo had to resist the urge to roll his eyes. "I'm afraid we don't understand your language but we are willing to attempt communication if you have the means to do so. If you can understand me now, please nod your head." He stopped. D'argo swore.</p>
    <p>"Frelling perfect!" he shook his head and growled with pent up frustration. "Pilot-"</p>
    <p>"Transmission is terminated," the purple image informed him.</p>
    <p>"What do we do now?" asked Filalla, his legs disturbingly braided as he leaned against the strategy table.</p>
    <p>"Since they can't understand us, I say forget the planet and get the frell out of here."</p>
    <p>"We could send a probe with microbes to the surface," suggested Pilot, ignoring the dominar without effort.</p>
    <p>D'argo shook his head. "They'd see it as a threat. From what John's told us, the Humans probably can't hurt us, but it's been ten cycles..."</p>
    <p>"And they'd never trade with us then," added Emmerit.</p>
    <p>"Not like we can trade now," said Jool bitterly from her perch on the table beside Fil. "Without John we have no one who can speak their barbaric language." And there was the problem. D'argo looked from the Interion's slumped frame to Chiana and Filalla shaking their heads, to Emmerit, then Pilot.</p>
    <p>"Hey," Medri's voice broke the silence over the comms. "We finished sealing the compression hatches. We still being targeted?"</p>
    <p>"We're not sure," Fil answered. "They can't understand us. You might want to come up here."</p>
    <p>They heard Medri sigh. "Right."</p>
    <p>"I still say we should-"</p>
    <p>"Shut up!" several voices shouted at Rygel causing him to pull back in his thronesled. It really was two bad the Ancients hadn't actually dissected the little slug.</p>
    <p>"Hey," Medri's voice popped back. "Rhia wants to know if she still has to take a bath today."</p>
    <p>Chiana hissed in annoyance. "Yes, the little mongrel has-" She stopped. The Nebari had a strange look on her face, head tilted in that way of hers that said she was up to something.</p>
    <p>"What?" asked D'argo.</p>
    <p>"Rhia can speak Human."</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 4: Did she say...?</h2>
    
    <p>It had been ten minutes. Ten long minutes since the aliens had finally responded to the prime number sequence. Ten minutes since the thirty second exchange that currently had about a hundred scientists debating translating computer programs, universal translators and other off-the-wall guesses from literature and the movies. But even as he argued against Star Trek's solution, DK couldn't help but wonder if they'd accidentally started an intergalactic incident by somehow pissing off the tentacled alien. He didn't seem like the type of creature you wanted to anger, and who knew what kind of cultural taboo they'd accidentally committed.</p>
    <p>"Heads up! We've got incoming!" someone called across the room. The SSC went silent as everyone turned toward the central screen that once again flickered to life with the visage of the tanned and tattooed alien they'd seen before. He rumbled a few words in an almost electronic growl, then a new voice followed. In English.</p>
    <p>"Hello." The voice was light and high like a child's. "Dargo says to tell you that I'm gonna translate for him since you don't have microbes." American accent.</p>
    <p>DK didn't know whether to be shocked and outraged or shocked and disappointed - was this all some elaborate hoax? And from the shell-shocked expressions on everyone else's faces, he wasn't the only one feeling completely flabbergasted. There was a whispered conversation bouncing back and forth between the communications, radar, and flight director's stations that suddenly ended with all parties involved staring at the screen in renewed awe. A moment later, Jeremy as designated spokesman addressed the aliens.</p>
    <p>"Welcome to Earth," he said remarkably composed.</p>
    <p>"The signal's coming from that ship!" Dan Bemear whispered to DK and Yora. The two scientists momentarily tuned out the official conversation to get the scoop that was running like fire though the room. "There's no doubt about it."</p>
    <p>"So how come they speak English?" Yora whispered back, clearly excited.</p>
    <p>Dan shrugged. "I guess were gonna find out." They glanced back to the screen in time to hear Jeremy ask that very same question.</p>
    <p>The alien growled something and looked like it was ready to bite someone's head off. There was a moment's silence before the translator spoke again. "I'm not supposed to say that," it whispered. Another voice spoke in the background, different form the first one and much easier on the ears. The alien on the screen sighed and looked to the side, then spoke again, and this time the translator put it into English right away.</p>
    <p>"He says that how I speak your language is too complicated to explain, and it's not important anyway. His name's Ka Dargo, and he wants to know what that first signal you sent was."</p>
    <p>"The signal was the prime number sequence," Jeremy answered surprised. "It was our attempt at communication, to show you that we are peaceful and wanted to talk."</p>
    <p>There were more alien murmurings in the background that Dargo stopped with another sharp sentence and a glare over his shoulder. The transmission only showed the alien's head so they couldn't see who he was talking to. Curiouser and curiouser.</p>
    <p>"I guess mathematics isn't as universal as we thought," Yora whispered. DK could only nod his agreement as they listened to the rest of the conversation unfold between Jeremy, the alien, and the mysterious translator.</p>
    <p>"So it's not going to kill us?" the translator interpreted.</p>
    <p>"No. We have no intention of harming you."</p>
    <p>"What about your government?"</p>
    <p>"Our governments are only interested in peaceful contact."</p>
    <p>There was a spate of yet another alien language in the background and several others including the one on the screen yelling in unison. The English speaker didn't translate. DK exchanged a look with Yora and Dan. This was absolutely nothing like Star Trek.</p>
    <p>"Um," Jeremy sounded hesitant for the first time. "May I ask what your intentions are here concerning Earth?"</p>
    <p>"Our intentions are to trade," the translator waited for Dargo to continue. "We need food and have currency to pay for it. Will that be possible?"</p>
    <p>"Just like Columbus coming to America," Yora murmured in the ensuing silence.</p>
    <p>"And us just like the Indians thinking they were benevolent gods," DK added with a wry smile. "Sure hope history doesn't repeat itself." The thought was sobering in an already tense situation. He exchanged another look with his friend, but neither of them said anything more.</p>
    <p>"I'm sure we can come to an agreement," Jeremy finally responded.</p>
    <p>"Good. When will you have a supplier ready to negotiate?" The aliens got right to the point, throwing Jeremy off balance.</p>
    <p>"Uh... we'll have to get back with you on that," he stammered. "Will you be landing?"</p>
    <p>"Only to pick up our supplies. It's safer that way."</p>
    <p>"Very well," said Jeremy, his tone indicating he was far from satisfied. In fact, no one in the room was satisfied. Here were the Earth's first aliens and what did they want to do? Trade. Period. With as little contact with them as possible. It wasn't supposed to be like this! And even as he thought it, DK knew he was acting like a spoiled five year old instead of the forty-five year old scientist he was. Intellectually, he knew that different cultures never trusted each other when they suddenly stumbled onto one another; he had only to look at Earth's rocky history to see the evidence of that. But in his heart it was all wrong, twisted.</p>
    <p>"We'll contact you again in four arns," the translator went on, and Dargo started to move away.</p>
    <p>Jeremy spoke in a rush, "What's an arn?!!"</p>
    <p>"It's time, 3 000 microts." Dargo added something else and the translator giggled, much to everyone's surprise. It was the first time the light voice had distinguished itself as another distinct being. "No, that's not right. It's 'one missi*ss*ippi one.' That's a microt."</p>
    <p>The room went still, hardly a person dared breathe.</p>
    <p>" 'Mississippi'?" asked Jeremy hoarsely.</p>
    <p>The alien growled again, the translator said, "Four arns," and then they were gone.</p>
    <p>Definitely not Star Trek.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>"What did he mean, they're not releasing the tapes?" Shannon asked a fellow journalist in outrage as they left the very brief press conference. "The people have a right to know what's going on, dammit! I hate the government with their self righteous 'national security'!"</p>
    <p>"And don't you just love how the US government is telling an international agency what to do?" her new friend said.</p>
    <p>"I swear if this is another conspiracy..." Shannon shook her head. The government really had no clue sometimes. Didn't they realize that by withholding the tapes of the first alien contact they were making the situation worse? So they wanted to analyze the close encounter, but Shannon couldn't help but wonder if that "analyzing" was really doctoring. It would just be like the government to stage this whole thing to refocus attention away from the failing situation in the Middle East. There was a '90's movie about something like that, funny but definitely scary.</p>
    <p>"I wouldn't worry about conspiracies. Not with all of us here," the journalist told her with a vicious smile. Shannon grinned back. There was absolutely nothing the press couldn't ferret out eventually, and with something this big... Oh yeah, the truth was coming out.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>"Dan, we're dying over here!" DK whined into the speaker phone on the desk. Due to the flood of government people called to Canaveral, only relevant personnel were allowed into the briefing room. Unfortunately, the Farscape team didn't qualify and was thus shunted back to their building to wait for someone to call. 'Someone' turned out to be Dan Bemear who needed some of their statistical data.</p>
    <p>"DK, we still don't really know anything. Besides, aren't you supposed to be figuring out how the hell they got here in the first place?"</p>
    <p>"From a flash of light? You've got to be kidding me. Come on, what's going on?" DK glanced around at his anxious colleagues who were huddled around the phone like freezing men and women to a fire.</p>
    <p>"Right now it's just a bunch of guesses," Dan told him, voice nonetheless eager to share. "That red stuff that appeared we think is some sort of communications device, though why it's still there we have no idea. Some general thinks they're listening in to our satellite communications to get a feel for us."</p>
    <p>"So it's not a shield like we first thought?"</p>
    <p>"Come on, DK. The thing appeared a good fifteen minutes after we sent the signal. If they thought it was a threat they would have put it up earlier. And they contacted us just after they did. Besides the thing has so many shifting holes it would be useless as a shield."</p>
    <p>"Okay, okay. What else?" DK ran a hand through his hair, grinning at Yora across from him. The petite woman flashed her teeth back, a smile echoed by the others.</p>
    <p>"No one thinks it's military," Dan continued. "So far it's not aggressive - "</p>
    <p>DK groaned. "We *know* that, Dan. What about the language thing and the English?"</p>
    <p>"Man, know one knows about the English speaker. Pretty X-Files if you ask me. But the running theory on the languages is that those microbes they mentioned are a type of Babble Fish."</p>
    <p>"Hitchhiker's Guide?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah. Something else doing all the work. That's all we've got down here, DK. Now do I get some help?"</p>
    <p>"I don't know, what do you think guys?" he asked the rest of the team.</p>
    <p>"It's pretty sketchy," said Jeff.</p>
    <p>"Not a lot to go on at all," added Yora.</p>
    <p>"Guys..." Dan moaned. "This is not funny."</p>
    <p>Over the mild laughter, DK soothed their harried informant. "I'll deliver the files personally."</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 5: Can I ask a question?</h2>
    
    <p>When D'argo had asked Rhia to translate for the Humans, she had been all excited and happy. She was getting to do *grownup* work, with her father's people no less. And even though she was disappointed that she could only say what D'argo said, she was still excited and maybe a little nervous. Now, arns later, she was bored.</p>
    <p>She'd been translating for Rygel almost three arns and nothing had happened. The Humans had been very suspicious at first, wanting all these questions answered before they agreed to trade. Rygel basically told them they wouldn't get answers unless they traded, and wouldn't answers be a much more valuable currency. At least that's what she thought he meant. She didn't understand half of what he said and eventually had given up when her head started to hurt.</p>
    <p>The Humans took forever to agree. Then they disagreed again when they found out they needed food for 10 000 people and it had taken another forever to get them closer to agreeing once more. In the middle of Rhia's stomach she felt a hole of disappointment in the Humans. They were unbelievably dumb. Didn't they see they were on a *leviathan* and had no weapons to hurt them, even if they wanted to? All the talk about invasion forces and motivations and weapons was like they thought they were *Peacekeepers* and made the ellka roots roll in Rhia's belly with the wrongness.</p>
    <p>"You haven't given us much reassurance," the Human on the screen said. Rhia had long since forgotten his name.</p>
    <p>"Species have traded for millennia without trusting each other," Rygel answered through Rhia. "What makes this any different? You deliver food, we deliver information."</p>
    <p>"How do we know you'll deliver?"</p>
    <p>"How do we know you won't capture us and dissect us for your own perverse curiosity?" Rygel countered. "It's a risk we are willing to take. This is a trade agreement. You send us an offer and we will send you a counter offer."</p>
    <p>"Rygel?" Chiana burst over the comms. "You haven't said anything about Rhia have you?" she asked agitated.</p>
    <p>"Excuse me a moment," said Rygel and Rhia quickly did, slightly frightened. The Human was surprised but simply nodded.</p>
    <p>"Don't tell them about Rhia," the Nebari said.</p>
    <p>"Why not? It's her planet," asked Rygel.</p>
    <p>"I've just got a feeling, all right? Don't tell them."</p>
    <p>Rhia felt cold. Chiana's feelings always came true, even if half the time she didn't know what they meant. To have one about her...that was scary. The look Rygel shot her gave her the shivers. If Rygel was worried...</p>
    <p>More than a little frightened, the little girl followed Rygel back into the negotiations, almost freezing when the topic shifted to her.</p>
    <p>"One question, as an act of good faith," the Human began.</p>
    <p>"Very well. Then you will trade with us?" asked Rygel.</p>
    <p>"Yes, then we will trade and allow you to land to pick up your supplies. We want to know about your translator. How does he know our language? Is he Human?"</p>
    <p>Rhia held her breath, but Rygel paused only a moment before speaking. Rhia stared at him but at his prompting repeated his answer, uncomfortable in the third person. "The translator is of a very rare species that can easily reproduce alien languages with the help of the microbes. We merely had her study some transmissions from the planet and she learned the sounds."</p>
    <p>The Human looked thoughtful, then asked, "Can she speak your language?"</p>
    <p>Rygel looked at her. "I certainly hope so. Do you think you can try?"</p>
    <p>And Rhia wondered if she could. She knew she could switch between complete Human and complete Sebacean if she wanted to, she just *did* it, though most of the time it was a mixture of the two sets of sounds. Maybe if she just picked Hynerion like she picked Human or Sebacean in her head it would do the same thing.</p>
    <p>So she tried it. "I want to speak Hynerion." And it worked; the sounds came out like Rygel sounds.</p>
    <p>"Oh my God," said the Human, clearly as impresses as Rhia was herself.</p>
    <p>It had worked! Grinning, Rhia was no longer scared or puzzled or anything except very proud of herself. From Rygel's pleased smile that he actually shared with her, she'd done good.</p>
    <p>"I assume we can expect your first list of bargaining questions within the solar day?" Rhia translated, her voice bubbly.</p>
    <p>"Uh, yeah, yes," the Human answered.</p>
    <p>Rygel had a few more instructions to relay but it didn't take long. As soon as the Human disappeared from the screen, Rhia slid off the table and ran to find the nearest person to shout her success.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>"Pilot, are you sure I'm supposed to open this? It's not moving," said D'argo. He tried again but the cover wouldn't budge. Frustrated, he hit it hard with a growl, wishing he had been closer to the refugees than Medri so he could be talking to them instead. Possibly hitting.</p>
    <p>"Yes, D'argo," Pilot's voice was more than a little strained. "If the DRD's could open it they would. Now stop interrupting!"</p>
    <p>"Fine, fine," D'argo muttered. He knew better than to push Pilot when he was touchy. The Humans had finally agreed to a set of questions that was much shorter than their first list but still way too long for the crew's taste. Since it fell mainly to him and Jool to answer them, it was no wonder the purple lug was in a bad mood.</p>
    <p>He glanced around the cramped space of this particular section in irritation, wishing, not for the first time, that John were there to take care of this mess. Of course, he'd probably be complicating things with the Humans beyond repair, but Moya would at least be in one functioning piece.</p>
    <p>Now where was that tool with the funny edging? Pawing through the box, he didn't see it. He must of left it in the other box in the main corridor. He cursed again: the closest way out was too small and the largest too far. "Seth," he called. "Seth!" There was silence in the somber corridor. Did he dare ask Pilot where the boy had disappeared to? "Seth!" No, too dangerous.</p>
    <p>Thankfully he didn't have to wait long; a faint "coming" echoed down from the right with the three cycle old just behind, blue striped DRD in tow. Running awkwardly on chubby legs, the kid nearly crashed into the toolbox before D'argo leaned to catch him. Giggles mixed with Seth's panting, drew an amused sigh from the Luxan.</p>
    <p>"Hey Seth," D'argo said setting him upright. He squatted down further so they were eye to eye. "Can you find the tool with the bumpy edge and claws like this on the end?" He curved his fingers to show him.</p>
    <p>"The Pincha Bee'le?" Seth asked, a puzzled expression marring his forehead. D'argo had no idea what he was talking about.</p>
    <p>"Yes," he answered and watched with envy as the little boy crawled through the tiny opening by the floor normally reserved for DRDs. A few minutes later he was back, correct tool grasped tightly with both hands.</p>
    <p>"What's a 'pincher beetle'?" D'argo asked, hefting it and applying it to the covering.</p>
    <p>"'Swhat Dad calls it." Trust John to name the frelling thing something incomprehensible.</p>
    <p>Seth watched squatted on his heels absolutely fascinated as D'argo worked. It took several tries to get the claws, or pinchers depending on how one thought, to take hold of the metal but eventually he pried the cover off. Inside was a mess of wire and fiber that smelled of fried circuits. Both D'argo and Seth recoiled, more than happy to leave the rest of the repairs to the DRDs. Seth helped him pack up the toolbox and push it through the opening, boy following. The Luxan sighed and began the long crawl back to his exit about fifty metras up the conduit.</p>
    <p>When finally he emerged, hands and knees aching, both Medri and Seth were there to greet him, the former smiling just a tad to broadly. D'argo glared, but Medri only grinned wider.</p>
    <p>"I talked with the Hedogens, the friendly groups that is, and explained what's going on," the spotted man began as they turned back toward the toolboxes. "They're willing to help with the pick-up. And I'll make sure they won't to kill us before arming them."</p>
    <p>"I can help, Med'i!" Seth piped up. "I can!"</p>
    <p>"Not this time," D'argo scooped him up. "You have to grow a little more first."</p>
    <p>"But I'm a big boy now!" Seth protested.</p>
    <p>"And it's time for big boys to go to bed."</p>
    <p>"No! I'm not ti'ed!" Seth wriggled and managed to get free of D'argo's large arms, slipping down on the opposite side from Medri. Within microts he had disappeared into the walls. D'argo and Medri stared at each other a moment before turning to the opening that foiled their size.</p>
    <p>"How does he do that?" the Luxan wondered aloud.</p>
    <p>Medri just shrugged. "They're still Chiana's problem."</p>
    <p>"Still your problem too?" D'argo grinned evilly, referring to bedtimes of a different sort.</p>
    <p>The pointed glare Medri gave him was not amused. "Frell off!"</p>
    <p>"Now there's an idea." He laughed when his spotted crewmate turned his back on him and stormed down Moya's corridor. Served him right for escaping the cramped access conduit. And since Seth was indeed Chiana's problem, the Luxan headed for the den to see how Pilot and Jool were doing with those Human questions.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 6: Do You Want Fries With That?</h2>
    
    <p>"I want precautions in place!" Landers snapped into the phone. "These are aliens, and I don't care what they've said, I am not trusting them as far as I can throw that ship of theirs."</p>
    <p>"Yes, Mr. President," the IASA White house correspondent replied. "We are being very careful - "</p>
    <p>"I don't want careful, I want secure. So you *listen* to what my security advisor has to say, understand?"</p>
    <p>"Sir, this is an international operation - "</p>
    <p>"That is landing on United Sates soil. I want zero problems and zero fatalities. So you *will* take the necessary precautions Giller tells you to. Or do I have to have a little chat with Congress about the budget?"</p>
    <p>"Mr. President, the IASA treaty - "</p>
    <p>"Treaties can be renegotiated." Landers snapped. Everybody hated big government, but whose fault would it be when the shit hit the fan? "Look, Locher, I'm not doing this to spite IASA. There are serious security considerations here, and it's my job to make sure that no one gets hurt by these aliens."</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir. I just feel that Giller is handling this the wrong way. Greeting them with an army is not going to generate any feelings of goodwill."</p>
    <p>"All right. I'll talk to him about disguising the army. Would that make you feel better?"</p>
    <p>"Yes. In that case, I think we would be able to fully cooperate."</p>
    <p>"Good. It was nice talking to you."</p>
    <p>"Thank you, sir." Locher hung up and Landers sighed. What a mess. The First Contact Commission had agreed to trade, and now it was up to him to make sure everything ran smoothly. Meanwhile, the rest of the world was falling apart.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Jack sat riveted in front of his television. He hadn't moved for over an hour, mesmerized by the incredible scene coming from just thirty miles away. Aliens walking on the Earth. Jack Crichton, veteran astronaut and moon walker was still pinching himself.</p>
    <p>The aliens were here to pick up their shipment of army rations bought and paid for with the answers to some 500 questions on every subject imaginable, from engineering to religion. IASA put the list up on their website with an email address for suggestions. Over three million questions had been sent in over a fourteen hour period. Many were duplicates asking about human abductions and other sensationalist things, many of which never made the final cut. Answers apparently started streaming in from the ship as soon as the first shuttle craft landed.</p>
    <p>The aliens were a sight to see. There were six of them loading the crates onto two shuttles that switched out every twenty minutes or so. There was the tall, tentacled one from the first transmission with a sword strapped to his back. Another was pale green with yellow, leopard-like spots and long, dread locked, yellow hair. The other four were the same type with pale pink skin, red eyes, red brown hair, but no discernable chin. All wore clothes in varying styles and except for Dargo, all carried black rifle like weapons.</p>
    <p>Two of the Red Eyes stood on top of the shuttle at all times, jumping from one to the other as the shuttles switched, keeping a watch on the people standing the requisite five hundred yards away. The other four were loading the supplies by manually orienting the large crates so that the shuttle lift could pick them up. The pilots expertly maneuvered the shuttles so their grunt work was minimized.</p>
    <p>Jack shook his head in amazement as the camera showed a close-up of the tentacled alien, new questions popping into his head. Why was the captain or leader loading the supplies? Why would he risk himself if the aliens were so worried about security?</p>
    <p>He watched as the alien bent over one of the crates. The newscaster stating the obvious for lack of anything constructive to say, "The alien Dargo is inspecting the crate." Jack sat forward, his interest piqued. It was the first time the alien had looked closely at a crate since he'd cracked open the first one to verify its contents.</p>
    <p>"He is sniffing? Yes, he appears to be sniffing the crate," the newscaster reported. Jack hit the mute button to shut the idiot up. Anyone with eyes could tell he was sniffing the damn thing. The green, leopard alien came over and stood beside him, and for the first time Jack could see the side arm strapped to his thigh. He shook his head to something Dargo said then leaned forward and knocked on the side of the crate. The two continued their scrutiny around the side but then stopped all of a sudden, exchanging a look and carefully backing away. Dargo said something, paused, then said something else. The green alien waved his hand toward the crate with a mocking smile before backing up even further to where the Red Eyes waited with frank anxiety. Cautiously, Mr. Tentacles opened the crate and pulled out something roughly rectangular. After a moment Jack recognized it for a bomb.</p>
    <p>So apparently did the alien, for he launched it into the air, drawing his sword over his shoulder at the same time. The camera was following the soaring bomb when a ball of red energy overtook it, exploding on impact in a flash of bright sparks that would rival any Fourth of July fireworks. Panning back down, the camera showed Dargo holding his sword to his shoulder like a rifle. Once more he spoke to empty air, the ship Jack guessed, tension evident in all of the aliens. Dargo and the green one relaxed first, seemingly satisfied, but the Red Eyes remained on edge as they began to reload the shuttle.</p>
    <p>It was then that Jack realized he'd been holding his breath. He relaxed back into the couch, relieved but confused. Who had planted that bomb? The government? One of those religious groups? Another set of terrorists? What did it mean? What would the aliens do? Why weren't they more upset about it? That was perhaps the most disturbing thing, that they kept on working as if they encountered assassination attempts all the time, as if they knew there were no more threats. Though they did seem to be working faster now.</p>
    <p>Once again the retired astronaut thought of his son. He wished John were watching this with him, talking a mile a minute, spouting theories and the latest IASA gossip. He wished John could have been there for the success of the Farscape II, the International Space Station finally going on line, Melanie's wedding, four nephews, Monday Night Football, predawn fishing trips, and a million other things Jack had never thought to treasure so closely. Now John was missing one of his dreams come true: alien contact on Earth.</p>
    <p>The phone rang, interrupting Jack's melodramatic thoughts. On the TV, another shuttle landed with more Red Eyes and an alien with three legs who immediately launched into a conversation with Dargo and Mr. Green with Yellow Spots. Worried after all.</p>
    <p>"Hello?" Jack answered the phone after the third ring.</p>
    <p>"Hey, Dad, it's me." His oldest daughter Lisa. She lived an hour south of Jack with her husband and two boys. Ever since John had died, she'd taken it upon herself to keep an eye on him. "You watching the aliens?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, I am," Jack said. "Calling to check up on me?"</p>
    <p>"Who me? Never," she denied with a smile in her voice. "But since you brought it up, how are you doing?"</p>
    <p>"I'm fine Lise," he said patiently. "I'm not going to croak from watching TV."</p>
    <p>"Watching TV and mourning John."</p>
    <p>"And why do you say that?" Jack sometimes thought Lisa was just like Leslie, psychic powers and all.</p>
    <p>"Because I've been doing the same thing since I tuned in." And apparently a little telepathy.</p>
    <p>Jack sighed. Most days he only felt the ache of healed loss when he thought about his son. Then there were the days that were nothing but reminders that left a trail of fire. The Farscape II mission had been the worst of those. Today was somewhere in between.</p>
    <p>"I'm doing okay," he finally said, realizing it was true even as he did. "You don't have to worry. DK's been by two or three times since we made contact... You didn't by any chance tell him to check up on me, did you?"</p>
    <p>"No, no, by the time I got a hold of him he was already on the way over," Lisa replied smugly, and Jack couldn't help but smile.</p>
    <p>"Can't even go to the bathroom by myself without someone wanting a progress report," he groused good naturedly.</p>
    <p>"Dad, you're only seventy. You still have five years before bathroom reports are mandatory. Until then I'm sure you can handle your zipper."</p>
    <p>"Thanks so much for your confidence!"</p>
    <p>Lisa laughed. "So what do you think?"</p>
    <p>"About what?" Jack asked, used to the subject changing without a road map.</p>
    <p>"The aliens, of course."</p>
    <p>"Of course," he smiled and watched the screen a long moment. There were two groups now loading the shuttles as fast as they could. They'd be finished soon and then gone forever. "A part of me still doesn't believe it," he finally said. "I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop. The rest of me is...It's like I'm walking on the moon again. Though I never imagined it like this."</p>
    <p>"Like what?"</p>
    <p>"All this. Trading. Supplies for information, armed and afraid of us. Whenever I thought of possible life out there...I thought they would be better than this."</p>
    <p>"Star Trek not Star Wars?"</p>
    <p>It was Jack's turn to chuckle. "I guess." Lisa didn't say anything more. Two of the Red Eyes were speaking with the green one. From what he'd seen here and from the released excerpts from the tapes of the other contacts, there were at least six different alien races on that ship. Six different races living and working together yet not trusting the new species. Jack probably wouldn't trust humans either if he'd been listening in to the planet's communications for the last couple of days. The news hadn't been very positive since they'd arrived, which was sad because the Earth had so much more to offer. Despite all the problems, there were a lot of good people in the world.</p>
    <p>"I miss him," he broke the silence finally. "John would have loved this."</p>
    <p>"I bet he's watching now, explaining his theories to all the other angels," said Lisa.</p>
    <p>They shared the silence then, letting the phone bill run up as they watched the final crate be loaded, and the aliens board their shuttles that gracefully ascended into the heavens.</p>

    Section 16: Guns n Roses<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"So does this happen often?" asked Sam.</p>
    <p>The sound of the enemy ship landing in the hangar echoed down the hall.</p>
    <p>"What can I say? People love us. Can't get enough of the Good Ship Lollipop," John answered dryly. He glanced quickly at the Major as she too watched and waited with a look of calm apprehension. God, he hated this part, the waiting. It was worse than the fighting stage, almost as bad as the frantic planning stage, but better than the everything's-gone-to-hell- in-a-hand-basket stage. Still, he hated it.</p>
    <p>"Do *you* do this often?" he asked in return.</p>
    <p>Sam nodded once. "Most of the time it's on a planet, but yeah." She paused. "I hate the waiting."</p>
    <p>John only smiled at the words that mirrored his thoughts. The two of them were hiding behind the access grill across form the maintenance bay door. They were too far from the hangar to see anything useful so Aeryn and Jack, in a conduit of the bay's ceiling, were their eyes and trigger for the detonation of several C-4 charges they had set up from Sam's packs. Sam had assured him that they would be localized explosions that would kill the bad guys but limit the damage done to Moya. Frankly, John was just impressed they had real explosives and detonators that weren't jerry- rigged.</p>
    <p>"Carter," Sam's radio sputtered to life. "On my mark."</p>
    <p>John raised Winona as Sam did the same. He could feel the microts tick by individually as they often did before all hell broke loose. The calm before battle settled over him.</p>
    <p>"Now!" Jack's voice cracked, and boom went the hangar. Instantly, John heard pulse fire from Aeryn and D'argo who were closer to the action, then he too was firing as the warlord's soldiers made it to the hallway.</p>
    <p>And John saw that they had a problem.</p>
    <p>"Frell! Frell, frell, frell! They're shielded!" Aeryn cursed. Shouting his own epithets, John watched the Qujagan body shields absorb Winona's pulse energy. His poor gun didn't have a chance. "Frell!" It was too early for the hell in a hand-basket stage.</p>
    <p>John's mind had raced over the variations of retreat, regroup, and kill before he noticed that some of the soldiers were going down - the ones that Sam was hitting with her automatic machine gun of death.</p>
    <p>"Okay," John snatched up the other military issue gun. "How does this work?"</p>
    <p>In answer, Sam handed him her weapon which he immediately took as an invitation to open fire and prepped the other gun before rejoining the battle. Already the Qujagans were using their superior numbers to flood into the hallway.</p>
    <p>"Teal'c, they're coming!" shouted Sam, one hand on her radio. "Energy weapons are useless!"</p>
    <p>"Carter, what's you status?" shouted Jack.</p>
    <p>"Our P-90's work against them, but there's too many to keep them all back."</p>
    <p>"You have all our supplies?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
    <p>"Alright, we're coming to you."</p>
    <p>"Aeryn," John said into his own comm. "How many did we blow up?"</p>
    <p>"Not enough. Ten, fifteen maybe. They are about twenty more and they are all shielded. We're coming to meet you, but we'll have to take the long way round."</p>
    <p>"They'll be through here by then."</p>
    <p>"Aeryn, John," D'argo broke in, "We need to regroup fast. Pilot says they're heading for Norianti, Stark, and Teal'c. They won't stop many of them."</p>
    <p>"Bullets work," John told him, firing on the last of the Qujagan in the maintenance bay. "All the live ones are headed toward Grandma's big teeth.  We'll meet you on tier five. Come on," he said to Sam.</p>
    <p>Grabbing her pack, Sam rushed after him as John made for the closest exit. "Where are we going?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"To make sure there's no one left on their ship that will stab us in the back."</p>
    <p>Sam looked like she was about to protest, but in the end, didn't and simply followed him into the hangar. They met no one. The ship was large, about five times the size of D'argo's.</p>
    <p>"Looks like a rounded Teltak," Sam murmured as her eyes professionally swept over the craft. "This side's clear."</p>
    <p>"Teltak?" John asked.</p>
    <p>"Spaceship. About half this size though," Sam answered. John turned his attention back to his side of the ship. No one, for which he was grateful for once. Then, behind him a metallic ring suddenly made him start and spin around.</p>
    <p>"Sorry." Sam smiled sheepishly, shaking he right hand in the air. "The ship's shielded too."</p>
    <p>John took a hasty step back before the ship bit him. "Well, that answers that question. Alright, let's go."</p>
    <p>It didn't take them long to reach tier five where the rest of the crew, including Grandma, Stark, Jack, and Teal'c were waiting for them.</p>
    <p>"Where the hell have you been?" Jack was the first to jump on them. "We've been trying to raise you for ten minutes!" He frowned first at Sam then positively glowered at John.</p>
    <p>"We went to check out their ship for any sentries, sir," Sam replied. "It's shielded. That must be what interfered with our radios."</p>
    <p>"You should have told me first."</p>
    <p>"I think we have more important things to worry about," John cut in. "Like what's going on?" Jack leveled another glare at him, but let D'argo explain.</p>
    <p>"Pilot's got them trapped on tier eight for the moment," said the Luxan. "Our weapons are no good so after Norianti blew her stuff they got out of there. They haven't figured out the locking override yet."</p>
    <p>"Which probably won't take them long," Aeryn added.</p>
    <p>"Well our weapons work," said Jack handing his pistol to his black teammate. "Carter, Teal'c, and I can go take them out if they're trapped."</p>
    <p>"Or ask them to leave," said Sam.</p>
    <p>John recognized her desire not to outright murder the cornered soldiers, and he admired it even as he noted his own lack of sympathy. She still cared; he could see it in her wide eyes and the soft curves of her face.</p>
    <p>"Right," said Jack with a glance in her direction. "The rest of you stay here."</p>
    <p>He turned to go, but stopped when neither he nor Sam knew which way to turn.</p>
    <p>Rolling her eyes, Aeryn muttered "This better work," as she fell into step beside John and D'argo as they led the way to tier eight.</p>
    <p>"You don't all have to come," said Jack petulantly.</p>
    <p>John glanced at him sideways, sure he hadn't imagined to concern in the older man's voice. "And let you have all the fun?"</p>
    <p>Before Jack could comment though, all hell broke loose once again.</p>
    <p>"Guess they figured out the override," said Aeryn as they scattered for cover. John pulled his gun more out of habit than necessity and listened while Jack, Teal'c, and Sam opened fire.</p>
    <p>"They're making a break for it!" shouted Jack. "Pull back!"</p>
    <p>Energy fire from the fridge-faces spattered around them as John, Aeryn, and D'argo bolted around the corner with the humans covering their retreat. "How many are left?" asked D'argo.</p>
    <p>"A good handful," said Jack. "A few went down, but they're using the sides for cover too."</p>
    <p>"Do you have a secure location where we could really trap them?" asked Sam.  "A cell? You said this used to be a prison."</p>
    <p>"Let's keep moving people!" Jack fired at the back hallway, ushering the rest of them forward.</p>
    <p>"A couple tiers away, maybe - " John began but Aeryn cut him off.</p>
    <p>"No," she said. "Give me one of your weapons. I'll circle around and take them from behind. I can take out at least two of them before they figure it out."</p>
    <p>"No. Too dangerous," Jack immediately objected.</p>
    <p>Aeryn just snatched Sam's gun from her. "I'm not giving you a choice," she glared at him. "Do you have more ammunition?" she turned to Sam. With a brief look at her CO, Sam gave her a fresh clip and showed her how to load it in.</p>
    <p>"Cock this for a single shot. This switches it back to automatic."</p>
    <p>And she was off. "Aeryn," John called after her. She spun around, still running.</p>
    <p>"I know," she said before turning around again.</p>
    <p>Behind them, the soldiers were still pressing their luck but Jack and Teal'c made them fight for every inch. John and D'argo led the whole battle slowly through Moya's halls toward the hangar. John had lost all sense of time as they kept moving. And then three shots rang out and the fighting stilled for a moment. One more exchange and it stopped completely.</p>
    <p>John looked back at Jack who was peering cautiously around the corner.</p>
    <p>"We're clear!" Aeryn called, appearing a minute later like a sexy Rambo. John took her hand when she joined them, more to reassure himself than anything. He knew she could handle herself, but there were no guarantees.</p>
    <p>"So much for asking nicely," Jack muttered as they retraced their path. Eleven soldiers lay as good as dead by severe bullet wounds. John looked at them dispassionately, unconsciously checking their gear for salvageable weapons and equipment. "Such a waste."</p>
    <p>John glanced up at Jack, his closed off face revealing nothing. John had to give him credit for knowing how to take out a threat. Teal'c was as unreadable as ever as he gingerly stepped over corpses. But John's heart ached for Sam who was avoiding looking at their faces. She was a soldier, yes, but with a good heart that hadn't yet been cauterized against necessity. John tried seeing what she saw in the young faces, what he would have seen a few cycles ago.</p>
    <p>"Come on," John pulled on her sleeve to get her attention. "Let's go get Chi and your friend." He cast a last glance over the carnage to where Aeryn and D'argo had found a live prisoner, before leading the way down the corridor.</p>

    <p>******************</p>\n\
    <p>September</p>\n\
    <p>Xander glared at the fasten-seatbelt sign that refused to shut off. The plane had stopped, they were on the ground, so what was the hold up? It couldn't be that hard to park a Boeing 387. Really. Xander fidgeted in his seat. Okay, so he was nervous about this whole visiting thing. Sure it sounds great on the phone, but then it's like your wedding come back to haunt you. He took a deep breath to steady himself. Five days. He could do this.</p>\n\
    <p>Around him his fellow passengers were shuffling for their things and finally, the seatbelt light went off. Like a living mass, everyone surged into the center, compressing and undulating like a stuttering snake as people jostled to get off the plane. Xander joined them, nearly tumbling his duffel on top of a woman's head when he yanked it from the overhead compartment. He only had the one bag with a couple changes of clothes, a Coke bottle of holy water, and his trusty dusty stake. The green and pink water gun had gotten him stripped searched, and for a while he had been worried that he would miss his flight, but in the end, everything had gotten through. Let it not be said that he was unprepared. Though he did wish he could have brought along his axe.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander followed the crowd off the plane and up through the tunnel to the gate. From there he followed the signs to the baggage claim where Jack was meeting him. And there he was leaning against a bank of tv monitors with his hands in his pockets. He wore the same leather jacket he had had in Cleveland over a button-down shirt and a pair of worn jeans. He straightened up when he saw Xander, a big grin splitting his face. Xander felt the corners of his mouth tug reflexively in response. Oh god, was his last thought before he reached the older man.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey!\" said Jack cheerfully. His hands came out of his pockets and he rocked back on his feet.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" said Xander. Neither one of them made a move to touch each other and he didn't know if he felt happy or sad about that. Maybe it was just the break in ritual throwing him off.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you have any bags?\" asked Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nah, just this,\" Xander replied, hefting the duffel a little.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Alright. Car's this way,\" Jack smiled again and led the way to the parking deck. \"So how was your flight?\" Oh, yeah, this was going to be a long trip.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I felt like I was in a sardine can,\" said Xander with a half smile, and was rewarded when Jack chuckled. Sense of humor still intact, he thought with relief.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, I hate flying commercial,\" Jack said. \"There's no leg room, no elbow room, and I always get stuck next to the noisy kids.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Always?\" Xander asked, feeling heartened by the start of an actual conversation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Always,\" Jack gave him a serious look that was belied by the humorous glint in his eye. \"But I guess you know what that's like.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Actually that's only my third flight ever.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I meant about the kids,\" said Jack. \"But it's only your third flight?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, after Sunnydale we went to Europe for while. See the sights, you know?\" said Xander. And find slayers and restart an international secret organization. But it had still been fun. Except for Rome. Rome would never, ever be mentioned again. Ever. \"I'd never been out of the country before.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's not surprising. I'd never left the country before I joined the Air Force,\" said Jack with a shrug. \"And I wouldn't recommend most of the places I've been,\" he grinned.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Bad service?\" quipped Xander. Given that most of Jack's file was blacked out he figured he really wanted to steer clear of the heavy military stuff.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The worst. Can't find clean towels anywhere.\" The colonel said with a completely straight face that all of a sudden made Xander feel like a weight had been lifted from his chest. This wasn't going to be a disaster.  With Jack's sense of humor definitely not going anywhere, Xander could deal with this. He'd been so worried after the last phone call that had promised nothing but uncomfortableness, but here they were, chatting about the worst hotel service money could buy as they walked to the car. And when silence fell as they pulled onto the highway, it wasn't a dead weight.  Jack fiddled with the radio until he found a good station.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander snuck looks at him every few minutes, really taking him in for the first time. Gray hair cut close, wrinkles around his eyes from too much laughing or squinting, a slight sunglasses tan, the hint of a grin. He seemed like the kind of guy who would laugh a lot at life.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" Jack asked after twenty minutes of this.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" Xander played innocent.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You keep looking at me. I don't have something hanging out of my nose do I?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What? No. Sorry.\" Xander smiled at that, looking instead at his hands then back at the road. \"Just you know . . . really seeing what you look like,\" he practically mumbled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh,\" Jack shifted uncomfortably, obviously self-conscious now.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll stop,\" said Xander with another smile. \"I didn't mean to stare or anything.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So do I pass?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked at him then out the window, confused. \"Pass what?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Inspection,\" Jack gave him an amused smile that made him feel silly for misunderstanding. Xander hated that feeling.</p>\n\
    <p>He also didn't like where this conversation was going. When he'd agreed to come for the visit, he'd thought he was used to the fact that Jack was his father. But sitting here, right now in the car, going to his house was another whole can of worms. And why can worms anyway? See \xE2\x80\x93 nervous! Getting sidetracked in his head was never a good sign. He knew he liked Jack, he knew Jack wanted to be in his life. For some reason something was bothering him about that. Trying to explain it was like trying to explain why he didn't like squash but did like zucchini.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know,\" he finally said. \"I'm still all with the weirdness.\" And how lame was that, he wondered. He really should just go ahead and have his mouth sewn up</p>\n\
    <p>But Jack smiled at him. \"Yeah. Well, if it bothers you, don't think about It like that.\" Xander could here the capitals around what they were decidedly not mentioning. Maybe Jack was repressing too. \"Just think of me like an old friend of your mom's inviting you for the weekend.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"A friend who just happened to have sex with her and whoops! Here I am,\" said Xander a bit more harshly than he intended. Beside him, Jack winced, the smile slipping a bit, making Xander feel bad. He hadn't meant to hurt him, but really . . .</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you saying you don't want to be here?\" Jack asked quietly, his earlier levity gone.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, sorry,\" Xander shook his head. Okay, now he felt rotten, like he'd just stolen a kitten from a slayer. \"I didn't mean anything like that. It's just still weird. And I think the not thinking about it thing would work much better if I wasn't you know, thinking. Or not talking and thinking. Not thinking would be good right now. You know?\" When Jack didn't reply, Xander turned more so he could see him around his blind spot.  Jack had a curious look on his face, his brow slightly crinkled in thought as he glanced between Xander and the road. \"What?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Could you repeat that in English?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander couldn't help but smile, the nervousness once again lifting from the debacle of the conversation. \"I said, let's just talk about something else.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh.\" Jack still seemed a little puzzled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sorry,\" Xander apologized again for being incomprehensible. Jack still looked a little unsure, and Xander desperately racked his brains for something, anything to talk about now that the silence had gone sour. \"So,\" he looked back out the windshield, \"tell me what's so great about hockey.\"</p>\n\
    <p>And Jack did. And listening and making snarky comments that Jack returned as good as he got, kept Xander's mind away from uncomfortable thoughts. As long as they kept talking, he'd get through this.</p>\n\
    <p>* * * * * * * * * * *</p>\n\
    <p>\"So this is it,\" said Jack as he unlocked the front door of his house. Xander looked about him taking it all in. It was a small, dark brown with a log house kind of look too it, nestled in a quiet neighborhood in suburbia. Bushy plants lined the path to the door looking like they'd been there forever. Inside it was calm. The builder in Xander recognized a good design and nice work. Light walls contrasted with dark, but tasteful furniture.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Your room's down here,\" Jack led the was to the guest room, opening it for Xander to enter first. Nice bed, pretty comforter, chest of drawers, mirror \xE2\x80\x93 all the amenities of home. \"Bathroom's to the left,\" Jack pointed in the appropriate direction as Xander set his bag down on the bed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's nice,\" said Xander. Way better than the room he shared with Andrew at home, in fact. It was much more . . . adult.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Come on, I'll give you the nickel tour,\" Jack bobbed his head toward the rest of the house. \"My room's that way,\" he began, pointing to the next room down the hall. \"Another bathroom here. Kitchen. Dining room. Living room.\" They went through in the opposite direction. The living room was nice with windows looking over the back yard across one wall and plump armchairs and a couch with plenty of pillows. There was a stone fireplace on an adjacent wall and above it . . . Holy bejesus! Xander felt his jaw drop open a bit. A whole buttload of medals were framed above the fireplace. Unconsciously, Xander stepped forward to take a closer look at the dozen or so decorations. Willow had said he was decorated but it hadn't really sunk in until he saw the stars and ribbons of a few very top honors. Xander was impressed. And a little jealous. After all, what had they ever gotten, besides Buffy's sparkly umbrella from their graduating class?</p>\n\
    <p>Behind him, Xander could hear Jack shifting from foot to foot as his eyes roamed over the medals and flags and caught on the photos on the ends of the mantle piece. There were two. One was of Jack in full military gear with a bunch of other soldiers grinning at the camera. They were all young, like in the picture of Jack and his mother. The other was of Jack and a little boy about seven or eight in a soccer uniform. Grass stains covered his knees as he grinned proudly at the camera. \"Is this your son?\" he asked, turning his head over his shoulder to Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>The older man nodded and came to stand beside him. \"Yeah, that's Charlie,\" he said with a fond, sad smile. \"He had just started playing soccer then.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"My brother,\" said Xander quietly, his own soft words surprising him. He'd had a brother. He remembered growing up wondering what it would be like. Jack glanced at him sharply at this tacit acknowledgement of his paternity after they had agreed not to talk about it in the car.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He'd be eighteen now,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>But he wasn't because he had died. The thought was too much for Xander at the moment. He didn't want to think about dead brothers. There was just too much death everywhere in his life. Even in this new normal part with Jack, death still left its mark.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How did you get all these?\" Xander turned his attention back to the medals. \"Did you save the world or something?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack gave him a funny, unreadable look before smiling slightly and saying, \"something like that.\" He shifted again, then stepped back from the mantle a bit. \"So we have two choices for dinner,\" he changed the subject brightly, the seriousness of the last two minutes dispelling. \"I can cook us up some grub, though I'll warn you that I didn't have a chance to finish the grocery shopping. Or, my choice, we can go out to eat.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You paying?\" asked Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Of course,\" said Jack, looking a little hurt that he'd asked. \"Consider it part of the bribery.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander grinned. \"Then let's eat out.\"</p>\n\
    <p>****************</p>\n\
    <p>Half an hour later, Jack and Xander were safely ensconced in a booth at Patrick's Grill, a local steak house from which Jack wasn't banned. It was a good place with pretty good service. One look at Xander's face told him that it had been a good choice. The young man flipped through the menu with glee.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Now that's what I call food,\" he murmured happily.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack couldn't help but grin. \"What do they feed you at that camp of yours?  Worms?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You have no idea,\" Xander sighed wearily. \"Did you meet Andrew?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No.\" Jack sensed a story coming, a glimpse into his son's life.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well Andrew's our cook and I'm not saying he's a bad cook, or anything, because compared to other options, he's a culinary god.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Your other options being?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Me or other people who don't know how to cook. I mean we have like fifty people at each meal and given that the . . . girls eat like hyenas, that's a lot of food. Andrew does a good job in spite of that. But we also have a limited budget, you know?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack nodded for him to go on.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Anyway, Andrew tends to get creative with things like Klingon Blood Pudding.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Klingon?\" Jack had watched enough Star Trek with Teal'c to get the reference.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Xander said knowing what he was really getting at. \"Andrew's a little . . . well I guess the nicest thing I can say about him is he's a nerd.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And the worst?\" Jack couldn't help but ask. Xander looked up from the menu and answered without missing a beat.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's the most annoying little creep ever. He's whiny and never shuts up, always complains and everything he says is related to comics or bad scifi. And I do mean everything.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Everything? Jack wondered. \"He's one of the friends you set up the camp with?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Friend is stretching it, but yeah, he came with us from Sunnydale. He didn't have anywhere else to go either.\" Now the distant look was back as thoughts of his hometown undoubtedly fluttered through Xander's mind. It must have been hard for him, all of them, to suddenly have nothing because of one random earthquake. Everything gone in a few short minutes.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So Andrew cooks food that keeps him in touch with his inner dork?\" Jack tried to get the conversation back on track.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Pretty much,\" Xander agreed, shaking off his mood. \"He actually kinda reminds me of me when I was in middle school. Except I don't think I was ever that . . . obsessed.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"How old is he?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nineteen or twenty. Trust me, he doesn't act it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shrugged. \"He'll grow up. He just needs a healthy dose of reality.\" He knew many a recruit who just needed a kick in the pants to straighten them out.</p>\n\
    <p>But the distant look was back in Xander's eye as he shook his head. \"He's grown up a lot actually. He used to be ten times worse than he is now. He's just the way he is, you know?\"</p>\n\
    <p>And Jack did see. He saw that despite what he said, Andrew was important to Xander. \"Sounds like a kid brother,\" he commented.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander dropped his head slightly and blinked slowly. \"You're kidding right?\" his voice was colored in disbelief. \"Because there is no way Andrew is anything like a brother to me. No way in hell. That's like saying twinkies are a good replacement for broccoli. Which they are, just not in a vitamin kind of way.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Broccoli?\" Jack asked. How the hell did broccoli come into this? And what the hell was he talking about now? Xander needed a road map to understand.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You didn't have an affair with Andrew's mom too, did you? Because I could so not handle that right now.\" Xander visibly shuddered at the thought.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No!\" said Jack, latching on to what he understood of the conversation. \"There are no other lost kids, I promise.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"There better not be,\" Xander grumbled. \"'Cause, Andrew? That's just *wrong*.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack couldn't help but chuckle at the vehemence of the protest. \"I'm just saying that it sounds like you like the guy,\" he defended his observation only to earn another look from his son.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm not gay if that's what you're asking,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>Gay? What? Where had that come from? Definitely needed a roadmap for this kid. \"That's not what I meant,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh,\" said Xander. \"Well, I'm still not.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I never thought you were.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What were we talking about?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Your friend Andrew.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh.\" Xander looked back down at his menu, seemingly not interested in talking anymore about it. So Jack, still a little confused about the inner workings of his son's mind, also went back to his internal debate over a classic steak or spare ribs. Neither one of them said anything until the waitress came and took their orders. Jack decided on the spare ribs while Xander asked for a steak well done. After she left, Xander started fiddling with his straw. Jack watched, unsure what to say to break the silence. But in the end, he didn't have to.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew's like,\" Xander paused, searching for words in the crushed ice of his Sprite. \"He's not like a brother or a good friend, though I think I'm past hating him. He's more like a pain in the ass all the time,\" his eye flicked up to meet Jacks. \"He's just *our* pain in the ass.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And because of that you'd protect him with your life,\" Jack finished. Internally, he shook his head. Sounded a lot like brotherhood, or at least comradery to him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"More than you know,\" Xander half smiled. \"So what about you?\" he asked, his tone shifting away from contemplation as his eye fixed on Jack. \"Do you have annoying friend-like people too?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack smiled at the turn of phrase. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I have friends. And yeah, they can be annoying,\" he added thinking fondly of Daniel. \"But I wouldn't trade them for the world. They're actually interested in meeting you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Me?\" Xander sounded surprised.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, you,\" said Jack impatiently. \"What, your friends get to threaten me and my friends don't get to do the same to you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Betchya my friends are scarier,\" Xander suddenly grinned.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So it's okay if I invite them for dinner tomorrow?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sure,\" Xander said a little too brightly. But Jack knew it would go well.  He was just nervous. So was Jack a little, but his team were all dying to meet the kid they'd been hearing about for months.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Great,\" he let out a breath of relief. \"Cause I already invited them.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, thanks for the warning,\" said Xander sarcastically.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sorry,\" Jack apologized, worried now that he'd messed up again. But after a moment, Xander relaxed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, it's no big deal,\" he said. \"I guess this is revenge for me setting Giles and Buffy on you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You set them on me?\" Jack lifted his eyebrows, not sure he liked what he was hearing. Had he scared Xander that much at first?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, 'set on' as in 'couldn't prevent,'\" Xander corrected. \"You should see Buffy with Dawn's boyfriends.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Your friend Giles said something about a knife being present?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander nodded with an evil grin. \"It's so much fun to watch. I get to glare convincingly.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The image of a poor teenage boy surrounded by overprotective young adults made Jack chuckle. \"Poor kids,\" he said. Then another thought struck him, but he didn't know if he could ask. \"I take it Buffy's parents aren't in the picture either?\" he went ahead and asked delicately.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shook his head. \"Their dad's around somewhere,\" he shrugged. \"Willow's are still alive but they're not what you'd call ideal.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Willow must be his other friend, Jack mused. \"And Mr. Giles?\" he asked. \"Where did he come from?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"England,\" said Xander dryly. Jack fought the urge to role his eyes. But Xander went on after a moment. \"He was our high school librarian. Willow being the big nerd she was was always in the library, and me and Buffy being the big slackers we were were always in the library while Willow got us through the classes we slept through. Giles was there too,\" he shrugged this last.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you kept in touch with him after you graduated?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Another shrug. \"He was still there for us.\" Xander took a long sip of his drink. \"So you said you went to college, where did you go?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"University of Illinois,\" Jack sat back in his seat. There was a lot Xander wasn't saying about Giles. And hanging out in the library all the time studying? For some reason, Jack didn't think that was the whole truth either. It just didn't sit well with him. But whatever it was Xander didn't want to share, Jack wasn't going to push him on it. Hopefully Xander would tell him eventually, trust him enough with the truth. The potential scenarios running through his head were not pleasant, revolving mostly around Xander avoiding going home. But without confirmation, Jack didn't want to jump to wrong conclusions that could lose him this burgeoning rapport they had going. So for now, he let it go and talked about college and ROTC with the Air Force. Xander listened, throwing out the occasional sarcastic comment. His son certainly had a cynical streak a mile wide, there was no denying that.</p>\n\
    <p>Their meal came, and as they wolfed down their respective haunches of meat, they kept talking. Xander asked him some logistical questions about the army, which was hardly surprising since he had just spent the summer running a camp for thirty kids, before they moved on to lighter topics of crazy natives from his son's trip to Europe. But it was odd, that he never once asked where Jack had fought or what he'd done as a soldier. That was the one question that almost always got asked by civilians. Hell, it was what had ended up splintering his marriage. But it was like the question never crossed his son's mind.</p>\n\
    <p>But whatever his reason for not asking, Jack wasn't going to question it. Dinner was going well and he wasn't going to spoil it by telling Xander to stop being weird. So instead he listened to stories about getting lost in Paris and scamming a scam artist in Prague and told a few of his own from when he was stationed in England. And they laughed and joked and ate desert. It was definitely a good start.</p>\n\
    <p>****************</p>\n\
    <p>The next morning Xander slept in late, only getting up when enticing smells from the kitchen wafted in around eleven. The first thing he noticed after that was the quiet, and he couldn't help but grin at the utter lack of responsibility he had here. Jack had even bought him dinner last night. It had been practically a lifetime since anyone had done that for him.</p>\n\
    <p>Feeling like it was a brand new day, Xander rolled himself out of the comfortable bed and into a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. Forgoing shoes for the moment, he groggily made his way to the kitchen where Jack was cooking bacon and eggs. The older man looked up when he came in and smiled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Morning, sleepyhead,\" he greeted him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Morning,\" Xander replied. \"Smells good. How long have you been up?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Since six. It's when I always get up,\" Jack shrugged. \"How did you sleep?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good. Great. It's really quiet here,\" Xander smiled. \"You need any help?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, I'm good. You want orange juice?\" Jack moved to the fridge and pulled out a new carton when Xander nodded. He grabbed a glass from the cupboard and set both on the table. He went back to the stove and fished out the bacon, keeping an eye on the scrambled eggs. A few minutes later the toast popped up and Jack served up the food and joined Xander at the table.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what are we doing today?\" Xander asked after a few minutes of mouth- watering goodness. Jack really could cook. Normal food too. Xander could do toast and sometimes bacon, but eggs had been a mystery. His were either too runny or too rubbery; no matter how closely he watched them they never came out like this.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I was thinking we could go out to see some of the sights. I didn't know what you wanted to do so I don't have any fixed plans or anything,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>They spent the remainder of their late breakfast hashing out a plan for the day, finally deciding on going downtown to look around and maybe pick up a matinee at the movie theater. After helping Jack clean up the kitchen, Xander went back to his room to get shoes and socks on before they headed out.</p>\n\
    <p>It was a nice sunny day outside, with not a cloud in the sky. It was so bright out that Xander ended up borrowing a pair of Jack's sunglasses after duly mocking their clunkyness. Jack gave him a sharp glare for that, saying Xander wouldn't know style if it bit him in the ass. \"Style for fifty,\" was Xander's quick reply.</p>\n\
    <p>They stuck to the walkable portions of the business sector, browsing shops and generally commenting on the coolness or stupidity of various trinkets. Xander was surprised by how much they both agreed and how much they disagreed over stuff, mostly along generational lines. Really, when was a singing duck ashtray ever cool? He had tried explaining this to Jack, but he just got this funny look on his face like he couldn't understand what Xander was saying. It happened a couple of more times before Xander connected the beffudled look to the Giles of old and realized that Jack really didn't understand southern California speak. Jack muttered something about roadmaps and connecting dots between random references that just made Xander laugh.</p>\n\
    <p>In the end, they skipped the movie, saving it for tomorrow or the day after, and ended up just chatting about simple random stuff until they had to head back. Jack's friends were coming around seven and he wanted to have dinner at least started by the time they got there.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Can I trust you to make salad?\" Jack asked as they walked into the house at twilight. Xander was tired from walking all day but it was the good tired of a time well spent in the sun. He figured he hadn't gotten this much sunshine in years.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, I think I can handle butchering a head of lettuce,\" he answered. \"I'm supposed to avoid cutting myself, right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack looked back at him before grinning. \"Smart ass,\" he said. In the kitchen, Jack began pulling out vegetables from the fridge, tossing the tomatoes in quick succession at Xander who caught all but one.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey!\" the young man protested. \"Okay, I am not cleaning that up,\" he pointed indignantly at the dead tomato that was now dripping juice all over the floor. But Jack only tossed him the role of paper towels.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sure you are.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, no, this is so totally your fault. I am not cleaning up after you,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're the one who dropped the tomato,\" said Jack innocently.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're the one who threw it in the first place,\" Xander countered in the same sweet tone of voice.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So now you're the one who gets to clean it up,\" Jack smiled, pleased with this final non-argument.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Aren't I supposed to be the kid here?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Which is why you have to do what I say,\" Jack nodded sagely. And at Jack's expression of knowing importance as if everything made perfect sense, Xander couldn't help but laugh. Jack held out a moment longer before he too chuckled at the complete idiocy of the conversation. To Xander it felt wonderful, like the most terrible thing in the world for once was a stupid tomato on the kitchen floor.</p>\n\
    <p>When they finally calmed down a bit, Xander wiped up the mess with the paper towels and Jack went to work fixing up some pork chops for dinner. Xander found a knife and started on the salad \xE2\x80\x93 not cutting himself as he minced up tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers. They worked in silence, but it was a comfortable one that didn't need to be filled. Xander smiled to himself. It had been a really good day. And he really liked Jack. He was funny, easy to tease, and didn't push on subjects Xander didn't want to talk about. He just felt . . . comfortable to be around. He was pretty easygoing as far as old people went and he didn't get annoyed with Xander's lame jokes or endless sarcasm. In fact he made worse jokes than Xander did. It was pretty cool.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander had moved on to tipping and tailing green beans when there was a knock on the front door. \"IT'S OPEN,\" Jack shouted without looking up from the gravy. Xander heard the door open and a couple sets of footsteps echo in from the foyer. Suddenly, putting down his knife seemed like a good idea. He wasn't exactly nervous about meeting Jack's friends, it was just that he was meeting them at Jack's house without any of his other friends to hide behind. It wasn't like he was at work and could be all professional and just talk about the new wall they were putting in. But thinking about work actually made him feel a little better because, hey, contrary to popular opinion, Xander was an adult and as such he could handle this. All this went through his mind in the fifteen seconds it took for the two men and woman to get from the front door to the kitchen.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, guys,\" Jack looked up and greeted them, still stirring the gravy. \"This is Xander. Xander, guy in glasses is Daniel, lady's Sam, and the big guy is Murray,\" he introduced them. Xander grabbed a nearby dishtowel to wipe his hands so he could shake their hands. Daniel was about Xander's height with brown hair who gave him a friendly smile as did Sam, a shorter woman with equally short blonde hair and bright blue eyes. Murray didn't smile so much as smugly beam. He stood behind the other two ramrod straight, and wore a black beanie pulled low over his forehead. He was very stiff, and it struck Xander as odd at first but he decided to worry about getting through this meeting instead.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nice to meet you,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The pleasure's all ours,\" said Daniel, brightly. \"We've be waiting to meet you since Jack first heard about you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh,\" Xander shot a quick look at Jack who looked back with concern in his eyes at his friend's turn of phrase. But Xander simply smiled instead, a little shakily perhaps but it was still a smile. He suddenly felt like he had an image to live up too, and he never did well under pressure. Especially now that he wanted Jack's friends to like him. And he all of a sudden realized that he was very young compared to all of them. \"Me too,\" he said. \"I mean, except with you. And only since yesterday.\" And realizing how stupid that sounded, Xander shut his mouth before he dug himself any deeper. \"Something to drink?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Both Daniel and Sam nodded with amused smiles, cheerfully accepting the beers Jack got for them while Murray received a Sprite. \"Relax Xander,\" Jack told him. \"It's not like any of them are your long lost relatives.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right. 'Cause we know how awkward that is,\" Xander returned, but relaxing nonetheless at the return to their earlier banter. \"Don't mind me. I'm normally an idiot.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sure you're not,\" Daniel contradicted him easily. \"Don't let us rattle you. We don't bite . . . except for maybe Sam.\" He cast a sly look at her as she sputtered on her beer.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Daniel!\" Sam swatted his arm, playfully outraged. But the tension was broken.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Come on, come on, come on,\" Jack shoed everyone to the dining room while he shook Xander's beans into a pot. \"We'll eat in ten minutes. Let's go sit down.\" It took a few minutes to get everyone from the kitchen to the living room and happily situated. Xander found himself in one of the big comfy armchairs, Murray had claimed the other one. Jack took a hardwood chair by the kitchen where he could keep an eye on dinner, and Daniel and Sam sat on either end of the couch.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what do you guys all do?\" said Xander to get the conversation going. Across from him, Daniel and Sam exchanged a look before Daniel spoke up.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We all work on the base together up at the Mountain. I'm a civilian consultant in the linguistics department.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"The Air Force has a linguistics department?\" asked Xander, surprised. \"For what?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Codes,\" said Sam quickly. \"Some encryptions use other languages as another layer.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander nodded while everyone else was doing the group communication thing. Made sense. Uncle Sam wouldn't want just anyone to be able to listen in on their top secret conversations. \"So what kind of languages do you use?\" he asked curiously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh . . . well, I usually work with the uh, ancient languages,\" said Daniel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you know stuff like Latin and Indo-European?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander watched Daniel's eyes light up in surprised delight as he leaned forward like Giles sometimes did when he was getting into a serious, yet incomprehensible discussion. And he should have known better than to ask about the Indo-Europeans \xE2\x80\x93 he'd already had Giles disturb his dreams over them once. Just what had he gotten himself into here?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, we still don't know much about Indo-European, just that it was the language and culture that unified ancient humans before they branched off into separate tribes,\" said Daniel. \"Now what's really fascinating \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Daniel!\" Jack overrode the really fascinating fact with a tired and put upon sigh. \"Do we really have to have a lecture about dead people right now?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sure the hockey scores can wait, Jack,\" Daniel bit back, cutting his eyes at his friend. \"Xander did ask . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, it's okay, we can talk about something else. I heard about the horse sex already,\" Xander interrupted hastily. \"Couldn't sleep for a week.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Dead silence met this remark as everyone stared at Xander for a heartbeat. Then, \"I fail to see what equine copulation has to do with the Indo- European tribe,\" said Teal'c.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll second that,\" said Jack who was looking at Xander strangely, making him feel uncomfortable for opening his mouth. So he knew about an obscure ritual, what was wrong with that? Okay, so he could think of a lot of things wrong with it . . . but so not the point here.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's, uh . . . a ritual of kingship,\" said Daniel. \"The ruler sets a mare loose and everywhere it runs is then a part of his domain. The king ritually has sex with the horse when it returns, thus marrying himself to the land. They usually sacrifice the horse. It's a custom that has been historically found in Ireland and as far east as Mongolia, thus indicative of an older tradition we call Indo-European.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's gross,\" said Jack with a grimace.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's what I said,\" Xander seconded.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Where did you ever hear about that?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I accidentally walked in on a conversation Giles and Dawn were having,\" said Xander, unconsciously shuddering. \"Trust me, had I known, I would have stayed away.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Don't go for the academic stuff?\" asked Sam with a smile.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That and it's disgusting,\" said Xander. \"Would you want to have sex with a horse?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" she chuckled good naturedly. \"But then I don't want to be king either.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what do you do?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm an astrophysicist.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh.\" Pretty hard core, Xander readjusted his impression of her. Not that he had thought her stupid before just that he hadn't expected her to be Willow-smart. \"So you actually do the telemiwhatsit?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Deep space radar telemetry, yes,\" said Sam with a grin and a quick glance at Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, don't get her started either,\" Jack butted in. \"Just smile and back away slowly.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So this is the stuff that bores you to tears?\" asked Xander with a teasing grin. Jack nodded as he sipped his beer. \"Sounds pretty interesting to me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You want to talk about horse sex again?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, I'm good,\" Xander hastily backpedaled. \"So how 'bout those toothless idiots?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hockey players?\" asked Daniel, returning the grin. In the corner, Jack sputtered as Xander had known he would.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't get why anyone would want to go out on freezing cold ice to beat on each other with sticks. That's crazy!\" He lifted innocent eyes to meet Jack's outraged ones as the older man tried to form a coherent sentence.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, Jack. Do tell us what's going through their heads?\" Daniel deadpanned, taking on an air of one truly fascinated by the subject. Jack- baiting was apparently a hobby of his too. He and Xander traded a conspirital look when Jack went off on how he had no friends who understood him. But he seemed pleased nonetheless.</p>\n\
    <p>Still grumbling, Jack shoed them all to the table to eat where conversation turned more toward Xander and the camp in Cleveland and then carpentry and construction working, finally ending up as a general discussion of first jobs and disasters. Xander learned that Sam was a major up at the base and that Murray had gone straight into the military though he never said exactly what he did now. He was an odd one, with a very precise and often formal way of speaking that, despite his accent, was nowhere near American.  Xander couldn't place him; it was like he had been born recently or something, but Xander didn't feel comforable enough to ask. Daniel talked about archeological digs he'd been on in college and mixups they'd run into with the locals.</p>\n\
    <p>And Jack stuck to the stories about the odd jobs that he'd had in high school. Xander liked these the best because they most closely mirrored his own often degrading jobs. And through it all Jack kept making bad jokes at his own expense that kept everyone smiling and happy. The running banter between Jack and Daniel was funny to watch, as were the occasional but spot- on zingers from Sam and Murray. Xander could see how close they were and felt a like the odd man out. But then Jack would pull him back into the group with a well-aimed remark or question. And even though it was different from home, it still felt right.</p>\n\
    <p>******************</p>\n\
    <p>The next two days flew by. Jack and Xander had spent a lazy day at the house watching tv then renting a couple of \"manly movies\" as Xander so eloquently put it \xE2\x80\x93 namely Charlie's Angels and the first Leathal Weapon \xE2\x80\x93 and generally vegged out. And it had been really good. It was certainly different than the usual hanging out with Daniel or Teal'c that Jack did. With Daniel it was always a struggle to get through anything without a million comments on taste or veracity, and with Teal'c Jack wasn't allowed to interrupt the dialogue with anything more than a brief cultural explanation. But Xander watched movies the way Jack did \xE2\x80\x93 with one eye on the girls and the other on anything comment worthy ranging from \"That is so cool, I want one\" to \"You stupid idiot \xE2\x80\x93 look up!\" After the movies they ended up staying up way too late watching the TNT Steven Segal ball buster before finally collapsing into bed.</p>\n\
    <p>For once, Jack slept in the next morning, though he was still up hours before Xander made an appearance. They had a light breakfast that turned into lunch before they decided to get out of the house and go exploring a little bit. So it was three hours later that they found themselves at the park, once again out under the sun. At first they just walked along the path stepping out of the way of joggers and their dogs. It was a rare moment of quiet for the two of them, unfilled with chatter. Xander looked relaxed as he walked beside Jack. Overall, things had gone pretty well, Jack thought. Better than he had expected in fact. Xander was a good kid.  He was so young and irreverent about everything, it was difficult to remember sometimes that this was the same man he had watched calmly handle a bunch of teenaged girls. The same man who had picked up and moved when he had nothing left</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you miss Sunnydale?\" Jack asked, breaking the peaceful silence between them. Xander looked up from the ground at him, caught off guard by the question for a moment.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sometimes,\" he said, looking back out at the trees. \"Sentimental value and all that. I don't think I'd have ever gotten out of there if it hadn't disappeared.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"If you had wanted to you would have found a way.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Maybe. What about you? Do you ever go back to your hometown?\" Xander asked.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shrugged. \"Not really. My dad died about fifteen years ago but my mom's still hanging in there. My brothers take care of that end of the family. We don't really talk much anymore.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why not?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack glanced over at him at the innocent question, then back across over the open field. He honestly didn't think about his family much. They were on an island whose bridges he had burned a long time ago. Now, it was simply easier to deal with them from afar with a phone call at Christmas. \"We were never really all that close,\" said Jack. \"My brothers were still kids when I left for college. Then when I went into the military, I never got home much.\" He shrugged. Jack didn't know exactly where thing had gone wrong, just that one thing had led to another and then when Charlie died, it had been too much.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do they know about me?\" asked Xander quietly.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shook his head. \"No, I haven't told them yet. It's not you,\" he added when he realized how that sounded. \"We just don't talk often. If you want to meet them . . .\" He left it hanging.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know,\" Xander seemed uncomfortable at the thought. Hell he had just gotten used to Jack. \"Maybe later.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No rush,\" Jack smiled at him. \"As I said, we're not really close.\"</p>\n\
    <p>They walked on, a quiet breeze ruffling through their hair. \"It's kinda funny,\" said Xander. \"You wanting a chance with me even though you never talk to your own brothers.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I guess,\" Jack thought about it. But it was different. With his brothers, it was as if they had tried and failed, and now there was too much resentment to go back to the way things had been. Xander was a new chance and more than that: he was Jack's child. He felt that he at least owed him enough to try.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Me and my dad never talked,\" said Xander. \"Not like this. And he never would have taken me to the park just for a walk.\" Jack didn't say anything, just watched while Xander continued to stare straight ahead. And he remembered his son's comment about Giles the other night \xE2\x80\x93 the British librarian had been there, even after high school.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wish I could have been there,\" he said quietly.</p>\n\
    <p>Shrugging again, Xander said, \"It's not your fault. Life just sucks like that. I bet you took Charlie to the park.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But I didn't protect him.\" The familiar wash of guilt spiked through him, blunted slightly by the weathering of time. What he wouldn't give to have him back.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You did what you could,\" said Xander who stopped walking and turned to meet Jack's gaze. \"I know you miss him, but he's in a good place now.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I thought you didn't believe in Heaven,\" Jack looked toward the field briefly then back. They started walking again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I said I didn't believe in religion. Never said anything about Heaven or Hell,\" Xander smiled. Having been to Hell, Jack didn't disagree. Still, it was a little odd to be on the receiving end of a life pep talk from a twenty-two year-old. Another reminder that the carefree young man had seen and done more in the real world than most in his short life.</p>\n\
    <p>They were walking again, heading around the last few bends before they ended up back near the parking lot. Jack's mind flittered over the age-old question of what to do for dinner. He thought they might go out again since it was Xander's last night in Colorado. The suggestion was met with enthusiasm and the return of the sillier, bantering Xander that didn't worry about life's larger questions. Like old friends, Jack easily swung into the same mood. It was funny how a few days had shaken away their former stuttering tenseness around each other. As they chatted over pasta about Xander looking for a job when he got back, Jack wondered briefly what it would have been like to have watched this son grow up. How would he be different? What would he be like then? But he decided not to dwell on those lost years, for he would never know, and all they had was now to make the most of it. Jack was going to miss him when he went home.</p>\n\
    <p>***********************</p>\n\
    <p>\"So I guess this is it,\" said Jack when they reached the security line at the airport. \"Next time I should fly you home myself.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That would be cool,\" Xander grinned. \"Can we get one of those harrier planes that does the vertical lift thing?\" He could just see the slayers' jaws dropping when he landed in the backyard. Major impressive points. Giles would have a cow or even a heard of cattle.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'd have to ask the General, but he likes me,\" Jack replied. \"So I might be able to swing it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Let me know when you do.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You betcha,\" Jack's grin matched his own. \"So you wanna come out here for Thanksgiving?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Thanksgiving . . . Xander shook his head. \"Can't. We got people coming home. You should come too.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack's eyebrows shot up at the unexpected invitation before settling into a pleased smile. \"That'd be great,\" he said. \"Count me in.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good. I'll be sure to keep everyone from killing you,\" Xander joked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just as long as the turkey you roast isn't me,\" said Jack. \"Now go on. Don't miss your flight.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shook the offered hand warmly. \"Thanks, Jack. For having me and everything.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack nodded. \"Always. I'll see you in November.\"</p>\n\
    <p>As Xander joined the growing line, he looked back over his shoulder and waved one last time. It had been a good visit, and he was looking forward to the next one.</p>\n\
    <p>****************** ******************</p>\n\
    <p>Yes, I know you can tell what's coming next \xE2\x80\x93 but I have a different format in mind just to change things up. In regard to this part, I'm most interested in what you thought of the SG1 interaction \xE2\x80\x93 good, bad, not enough. Lastly, thank you all for being patient with me. Until next time.</p>\n\

  content: "\"Where is he?!\" D'argo yelled at the quailing, yellow biped on the other side of a sturdy table.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"They had to leave about half a monen ago,\" the Procin farmer stuttered, his large purple eyes wide with fear. \"Rai G'arin said that the PK's were getting too close.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    D'argo roared in frustration. He cast his eyes about the small, Spartan farmhouse looking for something to break into tiny splinters. The solid wooden furniture was too weathered but the various clay pots neatly shelved looked promising. But before D'argo could vent his rage and despair on the unsuspecting pots, John Crichton put a restraining hand on D'argo's arm.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We'll find him, D'argo,\" he said gazing steadily into his friend's eyes. \"We're not far behind.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"But still too far away!\" D'argo jerked his arm from John's grasp and smashed his fist into the nearest pot, sending shards and yellow grains everywhere and the poor farmer scurrying under the table. John swallowed hard, glancing nervously at the fuming Luxon. D'argo was on the verge of full-blown hyper-rage, and having experienced Luxan hyper-rage once before, John knew that he definitely didn't want it directed at him.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Where did G'arin say they were going?\" John asked quickly, addressing the yellow head that nervously poked itself above the table.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"He said,\" quaked the Procin \"' As the Sunset Waters face the Zenith of Doroarin, so shall the Blade rise out of the sky.'\" The farmer's fear filled eyes never left the pacing D'argo. He leaned his head out a little further and whispered hopefully to the human,\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Are you leaving now?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Yes, thank you,\" said John with a glance at D'argo. The warrior was mulling over the lines from the ancient Luxon legend. A semblance of calm had returned to his face. Suddenly he nodded sharply in understanding. \"Got it?\" asked John. D'argo merely glowered at him and left the house.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Eight solar days later, the crew of Moya stood in command staring at the image of a lifeless ship with signs of weapons fire on its red tinged hull.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"It appears to be a Luxon scout ship,\" Pilot informed them from his clamshell image. Everyone looked at D'Argo, accepting his leadership in the situation. He licked his dry lips before answering in a hushed breath.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We board.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\
    \r\n\
    D'argo hadn't been on a scout vessel since his days as a young warrior. This ship reminded him of his youth, of the freedom and pride he had felt on his first military assignment. The same pride he had felt when Jothee was born. Jothee. Would he find his precious son dead on this dead ship? D'argo quickly swallowed the lump in his throat. After years of imprisonment and searching, to be so close, would he fail, have come too late?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    D'argo fought off the fear as he cautiously led John and Aeryn through the corridor that connected the airlock with command. They passed closed doors in the corridor, doors, D'argo knew, that led to crew quarters and the galley. He was only interested in command.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The door to command was partly open and the smell of death assaulted D'argo's sensitive nose. He paused in front of the red portal, afraid of whom he might find dead just beyond it. Closing his eyes, D'argo whispered a prayer to Zhaan's Kahleen and his own people's forgotten gods: please let it not be Jothee.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    D'argo took a firmer grip on his Qualta Blade, glancing at both Crichton and Aeryn, who, moving by instinct, had already flanked the doorway, weapons ready. Gingerly, D'argo pushed the door the rest of the way open. His companions swung in to secure the room, but no enemies awaited them. Instead they found D'Argo's old friend and comrade, Rai G'arin, lying dead in a pool of his own toxic blood.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    D'argo stared at his dead friend, protector of his son. A dozen memories of training, battle, and planet-leave flashed before his eyes as he silently said goodbye. But where was Jothee? What had happened? Grief welled up inside him; tears stinging his eyes. He had lost both G'arin and Jothee forever. The flame of hope that had flared when they had first picked up Jothee's trail died at that moment.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"D'argo.\" He turned to the human beside him. John's blue eyes held concern and sympathy. It still amazed him that this strange creature, who had become both his friend and brother, was there for him.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I've lost him, John,\" he said softly, desperately trying to hold himself together. John placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, unsure of what else to do.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Suddenly Aeryn gasped in surprise. She was kneeling next to G'arin's body, staring at something on the floor. \"D'argo, Chriton, come look at this.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Written in blood was a final message from G'arin. D'argo read the Luxon script aloud. \"Sebacean bounty hunter, fuel leak.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The three looked at each other in surprise. A crooked grin started to stretch across John's face that D'argo couldn't help but mirror as hope surged through him again. He would see his son again and kill the frelling bastard who had stolen him.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Let's go campers, we have a trail to follow,\" John quipped, jumping to his feet and heading for the airlock.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Several arns later, loud, crashing noises from the Center chamber attracted Chiana's notice. Curious, she glided to the door, wondering if Rygel had discovered the little surprise she had left in his jar of slimey bugs. As she poked her head around the door, the grin on her face instantly disappeared at the sight before her.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The room looked like it had been hit by a windstorm, and Chiana supposed upon seeing D'argo leaning his head against the storage unit, it had been. Empty food containers and plates were scattered all over the floor and table. The indestructible chairs were dented and over turned, and two of the overhead shelf's supports were broken on the far side causing it to slope.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Chiana's first reaction was to run away from the scene, but the odd sight of D'argo so defeated made her pause.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"He must be fifteen now,\" he said suddenly, startling the young Nebari. Lifting his head to look at her, Chiana could see the pain in his face, the resignation, and it scared her. \"He was just a baby when I was arrested. He probably won't remember me at all.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Sure, he'll remember,\" Chiana said, trying to reassure him.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Will he?\" D'argo demanded softly. \"I've been gone for nine cycles. I've missed him grow up!\" he shouted, eyes blazing with fury and unshed tears. \"All because I loved a woman of the wrong race!\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Chiana didn't know what to say. What could she say that would help the warrior before her? D'argo turned away, shaking in an effort to contain his roiling emotions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"How will I be able to protect him when I couldn't even protect Lolann?\" he asked in despair.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We'll be here to help,\" Chiana said quietly. At her words, D'argo turned and almost managed a smile.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    D'argo was pacing in command the next day when Moya found the wormhole. \"Pilot what is that?\" he asked pushing back bitter memories from the last time he had seen one of these anomalies.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"It's a wormhole,\" confirmed Pilot, \"and the fuel trail leads into it. I am comm-ing the others now.\" D'argo silently swore every oath he knew as the others arrived. If Jothee was on Earth\xE2\x80\xA6 He dared not finish the thought.\r\n\

    \r\n\
    John just stared at the wormhole in shock unable to think straight. Is it real, or is it fake? he asked himself, suddenly, whimsically, wishing for a daisy. He glanced over at Aeryn's rigid form. She probably needs a daisy too, he thought. Aeryn, sensing eyes on her looked back at him, her face a mask. John took a deep breath to steady himself and turned his eyes back to the sight before him. \"OK, Pilot, what's the deal?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Pilot hesitated before answering. \"The trail leads into the wormhole.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"What?\" screamed Rygel. \"No, we are not going into that thing. Remember what happened the last time. We are-\" he was suddenly cut off by Chiana's all too familiar hand clamped firmly over his mouth.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Shut up froggie,\" she told him absently, still focused on the wormhole. Silence gripped the room, the crew lost in painful memories. The blue vortex before them just waited. \"Your son's on the other side, right?\" said Chiana shattering the silence.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    D'argo nodded. \"Yes,\" he breathed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Right, let's go then.\" The others looked at her in surprise, but didn't argue. The steel glint in Chiana's eyes bore into Rygel's, just daring him to disagree.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Earth. Again. Aeryn was not pleased. Of all the rotten planets in the galaxy, why did Jothee have to get stuck on that one. It did have a few redeeming qualities, she conceded, but not many. And what if John wanted to stay? No, don't even think like that, she told herself sharply.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As if her thought had called him, John walked into command at that moment. \"Hey, Aeryn, has Pilot found out where the bounty hunter landed yet?\" he asked coming to stand beside her.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Yes, here.\" She pointed to a spot on the map in front of her.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    John snorted. \"Great, Los Angeles.\" He sighed heavily. \"It could be worse I suppose,\" he said.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"It could be Australia,\" Aeryn told him. He looked over at her sharply, scanning her face with his pale blue eyes. Such nice eyes, Aeryn thought for the millionth time. \"Another thing,\" she said breaking eye contact, \"D'argo can't come with us. We can sneak in, but it's too dangerous for him.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    John smiled slightly. \"Especially with that temper of his.\" Aeryn smiled back at the thought of D'argo terrorizing even more humans with his hyper-rage. Maybe he should come after all\xE2\x80\xA6\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Aeryn,\" John said, suddenly serious. He stared at the floor a microt, avoiding her gaze, before looking up, understanding in his pale blue orbs. \"I'm going for Jothee,\" he told her, his eyes locked on hers, \"only Jothee.\" Aeryn nodded, fighting the urge to grin with wild relief.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Satisfied, John turned to go. \"I'll talk to Zhaan about a sedative for D'argo.\" Aeryn nodded again as he left, his words had barely registered. All she could think was, he's not going to stay.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\
    \r\n\
    On Earth, in the city of Los Angeles, it was sunset. Angel and Wesley were in Angel's office finishing some paper work on a recent case and ignoring Cordelia who was happily munching on pretzels in a chair talking about her latest audition.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"So anyway, he asked me to put on my best smile as I did the laundry. I mean what kind of idiot smiles when they do their nasty laundry. And you should have seen the stuff they put on those shirts! It's almost as bad as - AHHG! NO!\" Cordelia screamed as a seer's migraine enveloped her.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel and Wesley jumped to their feet, sprang to her side, and waited for the vision to end while Cordelia writhed in pain. \"Hello,\" snapped Cordelia when it was over. \"I was in agony and you just sit there?\" she demanded holding her throbbing head.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"But you're always all right and you love telling us how much pain you're in,\" Angel told her as he helped her up. Wesley didn't say anything, just handed her a couple of Tylenol.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"So what's the next job?\" Cordelia glared up at Angel, debating on whether or not to tell him. Finally she grabbed a piece of paper and huffily wrote down what she saw.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I don't know why I put up with you two,\" she muttered still out of sorts. \"Hope you have fun!\" Angel just smiled as he took the paper. Charlie's, he read, man and woman, black hair, all in leather. Dump!\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Right, I'm off,\" he said grabbing his coat.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Need any help?\" asked Wesley hopefully. Angel shook his head as he put on his long black coat then left the office. Cordelia hrumphed a surely goodbye through another pretzel.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\
    \r\n\
    At Charlie's, Angel ordered a beer and sat at a table in the back where he could watch the door. He always hated these times when he had to make contact with strangers who hadn't come to him first. He was never sure what to say or how to approach them. No matter how many times he thought it out, he usually ended up messing it up. Especially with women.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel's eyes roamed over the packed bar. It wasn't a huge joint but big enough for a healthy bunch of regulars. Dim light and cigarette smoke gave the place a comfortable shadowy atmosphere that had attracted Angel here when he'd first come to town. As he gazed about at the businessmen in shirtsleeves, the factory workers playing poker, the college kids, the lonely women, the depressed men, Angel smelled the alcohol in the air that was always tinged with sadness and a little fear.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A blond was leaving the joint when he saw them come in. The man had slightly spiked brown hair and the woman had her raven black hair in a ponytail. Both wore black, from their leather pants to their long concealing coats. Angel noticed they had an air of nervousness about them, as if they were expecting a fight at anytime. Two toughs on the wrong side of the law? he wondered studying the unnatural bulge on the woman's thigh. Meanwhile, the man carefully led the way to the bar, weaving between swaying customers and tables.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Hey,\" the man said snagging Charlie's arm. \"We're looking for a guy who stole something of ours. Know someone who could help us?\" he asked. Charlie looked the two over then nodded toward Angel.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"He can help you,\" he told them.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Thanks,\" said the man somewhat surprising Angel. He didn't look much like the thanking type.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Mind if we join you?\" asked the man when they reached his table.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"No, sit down,\" said Angel gesturing at the seats across from him. At least he didn't have to get their attention, he thought with relief. \"I'm Angel,\" he said extending his hand.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The man looked at it for a couple of seconds before clasping it in his own. \"John,\" was all he said. \"This is Aeryn.\" The woman nodded slightly, her face unreadable.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"So you're looking for someone who stole something from you?\" Angel asked, trying to figure these people out.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Yeah, sort of,\" John said glancing at Aeryn.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Have you tried the police?\" Angel asked. He knew they hadn't but he wanted to see their reaction. John half smiled and Aeryn just stiffened even more if that was possible.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Last thing we need right now is the police,\" John said. They stared at each other in silence for a minute. \"Can we trust you?\" John asked suddenly. Angel, captivated by John's eyes, eyes that spoke of fear and hope, immediately sensed that this man was a good man, even though he obviously had secrets. But then, so did Angel.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Yes, you can trust me. Client confidentiality,\" he told them. Aeryn's eyes widened slightly as he said that. Angel could smell her fear, his heart twinging as he was the cause, and marveled that she could keep such stoic control of herself. She grabbed John's shoulder and whispered very softly in his ear, so Angel couldn't hear. He could hear John's deeper voice though.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Aeryn, we have to trust someone. I don't know this city,\" he whispered back fiercely. Aeryn looked at him long and hard before saying something else. \"Right. Go back there,\" John said pointing to the restrooms. Aeryn left the table and headed toward the back. She hesitated, quickly glancing at both signs on the matching doors before going in the ladies. John let out a tightly held breath and swung his gaze back to Angel.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Not much of a people person is she?\" asked Angel trying to ease the tension. John looked at him funny then grinned.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"No, she's not,\" he agreed. His eyes flickered to Angel's untouched drink before he spoke again. \"Uh\xE2\x80\xA6 this is going to sound weird, but could I have a sip of your beer?\" Angel was taken aback by the request. A grin played around the corners of John's mouth as Angel passed him his Budweiser. He couldn't help but smile widely as he saw the look of ecstasy on the face of his mysterious client as he took a large gulp of the ice-cold liquid. This guy either drank too much or had been denied the pleasure for a really long time, Angel thought wryly as he continued to observe the man sitting across from him.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Suddenly Aeryn appeared back at the table, yanking John to his feet and dragging him towards the door. John pulled out of her grasp long enough for her to whisper something that elicited a \"Frell!\" from his lips. Then they were gone.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel muttered his own curse at their sudden disappearance as he dug in his pocket for money and the scrap of paper Cordelia had given him. \"The dump? What?\" he asked himself. \"Why are they going to the dump?\" Angel shook his head as he tried to piece it all together while he headed for his car.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"So what do we do?\" asked John. He and Aeryn were on a very slow city bus heading for the dump they had landed the Prowler in on the south side of LA.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I don't know. You're the one with all the brilliant ideas,\" muttered Aeryn scowling, careful to keep her voice low. She scanned the bus for possible threats for the hundredth time, a guy in a patched workcoat with no teeth blew her a kiss.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    John stared out the window at the lighted cityscape of LA, barely noticing the drabby neighborhoods they drove through, each one more rundown and rat infested. But the lights - white squares dotting the skyscrapers, flashing green advertisements, street lights, stop lights, red radio towers - he had forgotten how beautiful they were lighting up the black sky. He blinked and the spell was broken.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"How did he wake up from Zhaan's potion?\" he asked again softly, turning away from the window. Aeryn didn't bother to answer. \"And Pilot said he was in full-blown, kill-your-best-friends hyper-rage?\" Aeryn nodded absently as she recognized their stop.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    They got off the bus and headed toward the dump at a run, each of them racking their brains for how to stop D'argo from getting all of them killed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Aeryn,\" John gasped as they entered the shadow filled mountains of trash. She glanced over at him running beside her. \"We'll have to take him by surprise and from behind.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel ran through the dark dump after his two would be clients, easily jumping over old tires and washing machines. He rounded the final corner around a messed up Chevy and froze at what he saw. John and Aeryn were positioned on either side of a door on a really big\xE2\x80\xA6thing. Angel didn't know what it was, but it was big and tan. As soon as he saw it, a huge demon dressed in red with long tentacles, a beard, and a funny looking sword burst out of the door. John, with a piece of pipe, and Aeryn, with some sort of gun, were on it in a second trying to bring it to the ground. The demon roared, and turned on them. The humans jumped back and started attacking from both sides, but the demon was faster and stronger.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    No more than a half minute having passed, Angel plunged into the fray, surprising the demon from behind. The demon turned once again, forgetting the two people behind him, slashing with incredible strength at Angel with his sword thing. Angel dodged and kicked trying to get an advantage, but before he could attack, his adversary fell with a final roar to the ground in a heap.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Behind the demon's crumpled body, stood Aeryn and John bickering about something. He couldn't tell what because Aeryn was speaking in a language he had not heard before. Angel found a convenient refrigerator to sit on to think about what the hell was going on with the two people currently oblivious to his presence.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"What do you mean you didn't remember?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I mean I didn't remember till I saw the blood vessel on the back of his neck. Hand to Hand with Alien Species was almost fifteen cycles ago,\" Aeryn explained.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    John shook his head in wonderment. \"We've lived together for almost two cycles and you never noticed that spot before?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I don't go around lifting up his tentacles all the time,\" Aeryn remarked wryly.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"You better not,\" John grinned. Aeryn smiled back. She gestured toward D'argo who was a heap on the ground.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We better tie him up before he regains consciousness,\" she said. John nodded and turned toward the Luxon. It was then that he noticed Angel watching them.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Uh\xE2\x80\xA6 Aeryn?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel stood up when John saw him and quickly put his hands in front of him when Aeryn raised her weapon. John spoke first,\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"You heard her, didn't you?\" he said.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel nodded wondering why, if they understood each other, they didn't speak the same language. \"Look, I'm not going to hurt you.\" John shook his head slightly.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"That's not what I'm worried about.\" John obviously had faith in the gun Aeryn was pointing at his gut.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I won't turn you in to the police, if that's what you're afraid of,\" he told them. John's quick glance at Aeryn was answer enough. Aeryn said something in her strange language. It was nice language, different from the harshness of demon tongues, with little clicks interspersed in the syllables.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"How can we trust you?\" John asked, rousing Angel from his contemplation of various languages he knew.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Here goes, he thought, the great unveiling of my identity. \"I'm sort of the 'policeman' of demons and I was sent here to help you.\" Angel looked at both of them intently. Aeryn was clearly confused and John seemed almost shocked. He blinked his eyes for about a minute or two staring at the ground at Angel's feet. Aeryn was about to say something, but before she could, John interrupted.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Wait, Aeryn.\" He looked up at Angel, a small smile twitching on his mouth. \"So there are demons on Earth and you're the 'policeman'? Sounds like a load of dren. Who sent you and why should we trust you?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel had no idea what dren was but he knew that the two wouldn't back down. They were in some kind of trouble and they obviously thought they could handle it. Some people were just so frustrating.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I just helped you defeat that demon,\" Angel said pointing to the creature on the ground. \"Does that count for anything?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"No,\" said John clearly getting angry. \"You think that because you help us knock out the big, bad wolf you're suddenly Prince Charming? Reality check: we can't keep a gun on you forever. Our lives are in your hands and that is unacceptable until we have something to bargain with!\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel was surprised. They weren't just going to try and kill him like most thugs he helped.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It was ironic that in order to help these people, he had to show his bad side. Angel sighed heavily, hating what he had to do. What would they think of him now? he wondered darkly, not that it really mattered - he was going to help them whether they wanted his help or not. So sighing heavily, he shifted his human face into his vampire face.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    John blinked and took a step back. Aeryn, unfazed, said something to which John replied \"He's not human.\" Aeryn said something else, and John turned towards her answering \"Aeryn, I'd thought you'd gotten past shooting everything that scares you.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel shifted his face back to normal and tossed a wooden stake at John's feet. \"Now my life is in your hands.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    John looked over at Aeryn and they gazed at each other for a long moment. Angel could only guess at what was passing between them. Finally John said \"Trust me.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Aeryn suddenly looked into Angel's eyes. Angel held his breath. This was some kind of test and he had to pass it. Finally she nodded to John and lowered her gun.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Part 2\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The unhuman human heaved a sigh of relief when Aeryn lowered her gun, making her feel a whole lot better for some reason. Whatever he was, it was unfamiliar and a shock to John, which didn't inspire her with confidence. As a soldier, unknown variables made her very nervous, but she had learned to trust John's instincts. The man had revealed himself to them, secret for secret, although Aeryn doubted he was very worried about them hurting him. The way he had fought D'Argo showed him to be a skilled warrior. Then there was the way he had jumped into the fight. It was something John would have done. That, more than anything else, earned him at least a measure of her trust.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    D'argo groaned from where he lay on the ground, pulling Aeryn out of her thoughts. He was starting to regain consciousness and that was not good. \"We need to tie him up before wakes,\" she told John who nodded absently in agreement. He stood with the wooden stake in his hands, taking in what Angel had revealed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Is there any cable on the pod?\" he asked, as he collected himself, getting back to the business at hand.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Should be in the equipment locker,\" she answered going over to D'argo while John went into the pod to get the cable.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    D'argo was just an inelegant heap on the ground. One leg was under him and his torso was bent to the side. As Aeryn knelt next to him to make sure he was indeed unharmed, the stranger silently came up beside her. Startled, the ex- PeaceKeeper immediately jumped to her feet, smoothly drawing her pulse pistol as she did so. The stranger stepped back in surprise, his hands in the open waiting for Aeryn to lower her weapon. When she did, an uncomfortable silence settled over them.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Big guy,\" the - whatever - commented, shifting uncomfortably. Aeryn couldn't help but smile.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"That's what Crichton calls him,\" she said without thinking before she remembered that he didn't have any translator microbes.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"You can understand me right?\" Angel asked. Aeryn nodded in reply as she finished her examination of D'Argo. The giant Luxan was fine; the blow she had dealt to his pressure point hadn't done any damage, nor had the ensuing fall.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Aeryn tried to straighten D'argo out and was surprised when Angel helped her shift his massive weight.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Was he after you?\" Angel asked making sure to phrase his question in a simple yes-no format that Aeryn answered by nodding her head.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Well, I found some cable but I don't know if it will be enough,\" said John from behind them. Aeryn took a cord from the proffered bundle and started to tie D'argo's arms while John worked on his feet.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I hope this is strong enough,\" she told John as she yanked a knot tight.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"What'd she say?\" asked Angel who was watching them curiously. John glanced up at him before answering.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"She said she hopes the cable's strong enough. So do I.\" John finished the knot he was tying and stood up. \"You said you were sent here to help us?\" he asked. Angel nodded. \"Know any place safe for us to take him?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Now it was Angel's turn to be shocked and confused. \"What?\" he finally managed to say. \"First you attack him, then you want to take him somewhere safe?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Aeryn suddenly understood. \"Crichton, he thinks D'argo's an enemy\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Oh, no,\" John said to Angel, forgetting that he couldn't understand Aeryn, \"he's a friend.\" Angel just shook his head.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Wait, slow down. What did she say?\" Angel asked frustrated at not being able to follow the conversation.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Aeryn said that you thought D'argo was an enemy, but he's not. He's our friend,\" John explained.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Now I'm really confused,\" said Angel looking back and forth between the two of them, his brow creased.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"D'argo's not someone you exactly talk out of a bad mood,\" John explained. Aeryn snorted at the understatement.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I'm contacting Moya, let them know everything's under control for the moment,\" she told John leaving him to the explanations while she walked over to the transport pod and activated her comm.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Pilot, this is Aeryn.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Officer Sun, is everything alright,\" came Pilot's concerned reply.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"How's D'argo?\" asked Zhaan before Aeryn could answer.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"D'argo's unconscious, but unharmed,\" she told them. \"We're safe for the moment and we've found someone who might be able to help us find Jothee.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Thank the Goddess,\" said Zhaan. \"The sooner you are all safely aboard Moya again the happier I'll be.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Me too,\" Aeryn fervently agreed. \"I'll keep in touch.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So there are demons on Earth, thought John. Figures. He'd been to the restaurant at the end of the universe and back only to find out that his own planet was part of the chain.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"So you're what, a vampire?\" he asked Angel. He still couldn't believe that the man before him was not human when he looked so nice, and, well, normal. But then none of his closest friends were human either, he thought wryly.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Yeah,\" said Angel.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"So why aren't you sucking my blood?\" he asked almost dreading the answer. \"This isn't some interview with a vampire thing is it?\" John remembered the end of that movie all too well.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel smiled and shook his head. \"No, I'm cursed with a soul.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Now what the frell did that mean, John wondered. He reasoned it must be something good because Angel hadn't killed them yet; instead he had actually helped them.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Aeryn came back then. She nodded to John that Moya and the rest were up to speed. He hoped they weren't too worried about them. At least this time they could keep in touch with each other.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"So, what are you?\" asked Angel, fully grabbing John's attention. What were they? John began to laugh. Well, the vampire with a soul had given him a shock, so turnabout's fair play.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Well, I'm your garden variety, everyday, wormhole traveling human being.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Aeryn's a Sebacean and D'Argo's a Luxan; they're both aliens.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel just stood there with a stunned expression on his face. \"She's not human?\" he spluttered pointing at Aeryn who muttered something about rather being in the living death than human.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    John grinned. \"Nope, purebred alien.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"You mean, from another planet? Not supernatural, but scientific aliens?\" Angel was flabbergasted. \"Whoa,\" he said putting a hand on his head trying to absorb it all. \"I mean I've seen demons and crazy magic, and other dimensions, but real aliens from our own! In this universe?\" Angel shook his head but there was a small smile on his face. \"No wonder you want to stay away from the government.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"So you'll still help us?\" asked John suddenly nervous. They desperately needed his help and, after seeing his positive reaction to his alien friends, John trusted him even more.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Yeah,\" replied Angel. \"My car's this way.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&\r\n\
    \r\n\
    An hour later they were in Angel's black convertible heading for his office. D'argo was tied up and unconscious on the backseat and John and Aeryn were next to Angel up front. As they drove through the dark streets, Angel half listened to John tell Aeryn everything he knew about demons and vampires, which wasn't much, while he, for his part, tried to get over the fact that he had real, same-dimension aliens in his car. Little, green men his ass, he thought glancing over at the beautiful Aeryn.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel had had plenty of experience in dealing with creatures from the various underworlds of Earth and a few other dimensions that were tied to Earth by one force or another, but never any that were completely unrelated. It was an incredible thought and Angel was shocked to find that he was surprised by this fact. He was so busy dealing with the nightmares of the world that he had never really considered the possibility of life on other planets.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    He looked in the rearview mirror again at D'argo. He had so many questions about these people. Why would they attack a \"friend\"? Why did they insist he be tied up? And how the hell did John, an obvious human, get out into space with them in the first place? And how did he understand their language when he still spoke English? The questions would have to wait till they got back to the office. Angel looked at the clock; it was almost ten. Cordelia and Wesley would still be waiting for him. Wait till they found out about this, he thought, laughing to himself.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"And that's about all I know,\" he heard John say. \"Zhaan would probably be better at explaining this than me.\" Aeryn said something in reply and John quietly laughed. \"Darlin', I'm just a simple scientist. My planet or not, when it comes to the mystic, it's Zhaan's job to save us.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Who was Zhaan? wondered Angel as he pulled onto his street. He drove around to the back of the small office building and parked the car. \"Here we are,\" he said jumping out. John and Aeryn quickly followed. They all stared at D'argo lying in the back, none of them cherishing the idea of lugging him inside. Their trek through the dump with the three of them hauling his huge bulk had not been a pleasant one.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I think I'm gonna get help,\" said Angel looking at John who nodded. He turned and went to the front of the small office building and unlocked the door. Bounding up the stairs, he heard Wesley and Cordelia's bickering voices.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Cordelia, I didn't mean\xE2\x80\xA6how do I put this?\" Wesley was saying.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Hey,\" said Angel sticking his head through the doorway.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Any luck?\" asked Wesley jumping up out of his chair, grateful for the diversion.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"How much they paying?\" Cordelia asked at the same time. Angel groaned inwardly.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We'll talk about that later. I need your help at the car.\" Curious, the two followed Angel back outside.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    When they got to the car, John and Aeryn regarded his friends with suspicion. Aeryn's hand went to the weapon at her side, but she let them approach.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I am not touching that thing,\" announced Cordelia after Angel told them they had to get D'argo inside. Angel closed his eyes briefly in frustration. He had known this would happen. Of course, it would have been much worse if he hadn't left out the part about D'argo and Aeryn being aliens. Angel shuddered at the thought.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Fine,\" he said to Cordelia, \"just open the doors.\" Angel, Wesley, John, and Aeryn pulled D'argo out of the car and with a lot of grunting and stopping, finally managed to get him down in Angel's apartment. Cordelia dutifully opened all the doors.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"That's all we know,\" finished John. It was eleven thirty. Aeryn was in Angel's bedroom keeping an eye on D'argo and avoiding John's fellow earthlings. The terse introductions and hasty explanations that glossed over last names and the fact that D'argo and Aeryn were aliens, hadn't gone over too well. Wesley clearly wasn't sure what to make of two people bringing home a demon friend but Cordelia just eyed them with suspicion, and in John's case, appraisal, which hadn't done much for the comfort factor - especially since it had pissed Aeryn off. Angel finally picked up on it and sent Cordelia home, for which John was eternally grateful. Aeryn had escaped as soon as she could, leaving John to explain the case.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So now John was sitting at the kitchen table with Angel and Wesley drinking coffee. Honest to goodness, bitter, refreshing coffee. Man, had he missed coffee all those days in the Uncharteds when he had an early shift in command. He closed his eyes just enjoying the black heat that slid down his throat. He could live in this moment. So of course, Wesley chose that moment to ask him another question.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Is there anything that might help us identify the Sebacean?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I don' know,\" John sighed. \"Aeryn might know something, but we never saw him.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We'll ask around for people who might have seen Jothee,\" said Angel. \"That's probably the best trail to follow.\" Wesley nodded and started gathering up his notes, trying to stifle a yawn.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Pardon me,\" he said for the yawn. \"I really must be going,\" he added offering John his hand. \"Nice meeting you, John.\" John firmly shook his hand. It felt really good shaking hands again. It beat pulse rifles in his face any day.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel stood too and glanced around his dark apartment. \"You guys can crash here,\" he said to his guest. \"I'm going to start looking for Jothee.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Isn't it a little late?\" asked John surprised.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Not for me,\" said Angel, and with that he was gone.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Right, thought John. He had forgotten about that. He sighed and took his coffee to the couch. John was really tired. Moya time it was closer to early morning than the middle of the night. Thoughts tumbled around in his mind, not making much sense. He was on Earth, the real Earth, and it was like he was on another foreign planet. More weird creatures, more weird cities, more hiding. Would it ever end?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Soft footsteps came up behind him, then Aeryn came into view. She sat down next to him on the couch, their shoulders touching. As John tentatively put his arm around her, Aeryn snuggled closer.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"How you doin', Sunshine?\" he asked. Aeryn rolled her head towards him before answering.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Well, we're on Earth, in hiding, a strange creature we barely know is helping us, and we've been in one fight today, against D'argo, no less. I'm doing fine.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    John chuckled at her response--it seemed that his sarcasm was beginning to rub off on her. \"Are you telling me this is just another ordinary day?\" he asked grinning wickedly.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Aeryn pretended to think it over. \"Well, not quite ordinary,\" she said grinning back. \"Neither you, Chiana, nor Rygel caused the trouble were in.\" John laughed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"OK, you want out of the ordinary? I'll show out of the ordinary tomorrow when I take you out on the town, babe,\" he told her.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"And how will you do that?\" Aeryn asked her curiosity showing in her\r\n\
    \r\n\
    twinkling eyes.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Because, for a change, I know tons more about this place than you do!\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Meanwhile, out on the underside of town, Angel was checking out all the local demon haunts. He had been to about five so far with no success; none of the generally observant proprietors had seen anything.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It was about two when Angel stepped into a high class, gambling joint where well-to-do demons and their associates came to chat and throw away some money. Angel skirted the edge of the dimly lit casino toward the bar. He was in luck; Dixon was at the counter mixing drinks. Angel came up and stood next to a little bald man with red cheeks and patiently waited for Dixon. He glanced around his surroundings at the variety of pebbled and leathery skinned demons in all shades of green, blue, and gray, each impeccably dressed as they gambled and drank with their human associates on posh velvet chairs and mahogany tables.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Finally the little man walked away with his martini. \"New to the joint,\" Dixon told him conversationally, nodding after the man. \"Still a little nervous around horns and tails.\" He turned his attention back to Angel. \"So what can I do ya for?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I'm looking for a kid, about fifteen, with long tentacles on his head. He's in custody of guy who doesn't speak English,\" said Angel.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"What's it worth?\" asked Dixon slyly. He wasn't about to pass up a chance to make a profit.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"It's worth me not giving your boss the file I have on your\xE2\x80\xA6 barside activities,\" Angel replied maliciously. Dixon gulped. He had forgotten Angel knew about that.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"OK, OK,\" he said hastily. \"But not much has been happenin' around here for the last couple a' weeks.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Dixon,\" said Angel, \"you've got eyes in the back of your head, surely you've seen something. If not\xE2\x80\xA6\" he trailed away suggestively.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Let me think!\" pleaded Dixon as he glanced nervously about the room for any potential eavesdroppers. \"OK, about five hours ago I was in the storeroom, right? Mr. LeCuinda came in the back with two people. One had a sack over his head so I couldn't see him, right? But the other was a tall man\xE2\x80\xA6uh, black hair,\xE2\x80\xA6 dark clothes, and a gun on his hip. LeCuinda said something to him and he answered in a language that definitely was not English or anything like any demon language I know, and I know a lot of them, at least what they sound like. I remember thinking it was kind of funny because most of the human types speak English, right? But workin' in this joint\xE2\x80\xA6\" Dixon shook his head. \"So that's what I know.\" Angel nodded and got off the stool.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"LeCuinda, what's he?\" he asked.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Um\xE2\x80\xA6I think he's a Langston demon,\" said Dixon after a moment. Angel laid a twenty down on the counter. Dixon stared at it before pulling it towards himself. \"So\xE2\x80\xA6 uh\xE2\x80\xA6 you're not going to give my boss that file, right?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel smiled coldly. \"Just keep giving me reasons not to and I never will.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Part 3\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel returned home after his chat with Dixon to find John and Aeryn fast asleep on the couch. Leaving them to dream, he checked on D'argo who was still out cold in the bedroom before settling down in the armchair in the livingroom area. He watched his two guests sleep for a minute, John's arm around Aeryn and her head on his chest, remembering a time when he had a certain vampire slayer in his arms like that. Now she was in that macho commando, Riley's arms. Angel sighed, thoroughly depressed at the thought and tried to close the door on the painful past. Thankfully, the stress of the day quickly pulled him into sleep.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A crash in the next room startled Angel into consciousness. He jumped up and found Aeryn and John already on their feet, Aeryn's gun raised in a defensive posture and John's hand on his empty holster. Another crash echoed from the bedroom and the Luxan's hulking form, still bound by cable, hopped through the doorway. He was an impressive sight with his long tentacles and braids flying about his tattooed head and Angel could tell he was really pissed off. He began shouting in a barking language. The human and sebacean both answered at the same time. Angel couldn't think straight with the noise of three shouted languages bouncing around the room. Then suddenly, they were all looking at him.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Uhh\xE2\x80\xA6I'm\xE2\x80\xA6gonna go upstairs now,\" he said, not about to get involved in this fight when he couldn't even understand two of the belligerents. The Luxan was still tied up, Aeryn had her gun, and the only way out of the building that his guests new of was where Angel was going to be, so it seemed safe enough to leave them alone. And they were friends? thought Angel, shaking his head.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Wesley was pouring over one of the large demon tomes in Angel's office when he came upstairs. The lamp was on and the blinds were closed as usual lending the room a very somber, scholarly atmosphere.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Good morning, Angel,\" said Wesley looking up from his book. \"Are you alright this morning? You look a bit\xE2\x80\xA6 off,\" he said.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel sighed and sat down at his desk. \"The aliens are fighting downstairs. Woke me up from my four hours of sleep.\" He rubbed a hand over his tired eyes. \"I don't know what to make of them, Wesley.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Wesley nodded in agreement. \"Yes, I can certainly under- wait, did you say *aliens*?\" Wesley's jaw dropped.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Angel nodded, groaning inwardly. Partly because of the confusion and the need to get D'Argo safely confined, and partly because, to be honest, Angel wasn't up to what he knew would be a lengthy discussion, he had sort of skipped the details in last nights hasty introductions - like the part about Aeryn and D'Argo being aliens. For that matter, the tormented vampire still didn't know John's last name-he'd never gotten around to asking.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"It seems you better fill me in,\" said Wesley testily, \"before I waste another hour trying to find out the strengths and weaknesses of a Luxan demon.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So Angel told Wesley what he knew about their guests from outer space, from first contact to what Dixon had told him about the Langston demon. \"And now they're fighting in my apartment and I can't understand a word they're saying,\" he finished.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I might be able to remedy that,\" said Wesley jumping out of his chair and turning to the bookshelf behind him. He had taken the news rather well, which didn't really surprise Angel considering his job. The ex-Watcher found the book he was looking for and quickly began to leaf through the pages.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"What are you looking for?\" asked Angel curiously leaning across his desk.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"There's a universal translation spell in here that might solve our communication problem. Ah here it is,\" he said. He ran his finger down the page stopping about halfway down. \"You cast the spell on the being who doesn't speak the language, then whenever they speak, those around them understand what he's saying.\" Angel got up to look over Wesley's shoulder, then clapped him gently on the back.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Good work. Now we'll be able to find out who these people really are.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Yes,\" agreed Wesley distractedly. He went into the other room and stood facing Cordelia's computer. He just stared at the thing for several minutes then he turned it on.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Wesley?\" asked Angel surprised. The man hated that thing. \"What are you doing now?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"There's something familiar about John and since he doesn't seemed inclined to tell us about himself, I thought I'd see if I could find out something,\" Wesley said clicking the mouse. \"That is, if I can figure out how to use this thing.\" Angel shook his head again, heading toward the elevator.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As he left, Cordelia walked in. She stopped short at the door, nearly dropping her coffee, as soon as she saw Wesley at the computer. \"Oh my God,\" she cried. \"The world's going to end!\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    ************\r\n\
    \r\n\
    About half an arn before the aspiring actress came into work, D'argo woke up in a strange room, with a pounding headache, and ropes tightly tied around his arms and feet. Worst of all, he remembered why he was here, on Earth. Jothee had been captured and brought here by a bounty hunter.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    D'argo tried to stand up, but the effects of the blow to his pressure point affected his balance and he fell to the floor with a crash. Slowly, he pushed himself back to his feet, then caught himself on the table by the bed, knocking something onto the floor as he started to sway again. Cursing under his breath and straining at the cords, D'argo hopped through the open doorway. Aeryn and Crichton were in the next room, the sight of them filling D'argo with uncontrollable anger.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The hyper-rage instantly upon him, D'Argo's thoughts raced. His friends had betrayed him! They had conspired with that blue plant to keep him on the ship and away from his son! They must be in league with the bounty hunter and were going to help give Jothee to Macton! Why else would they attack him from behind and bind him like a prisoner! The fierce warrior had sworn he would never be a prisoner again and now he swore that neither would his son!\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Where is he?!\" D'argo yelled at his comrades. \"What have you done to him?!\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Aeryn reholstered the pulse gun in her hand as both she and Crichton spoke. \"We haven't found him yet.\" \"What do you mean what have we done to him?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"How could you do this to me?!\" D'argo demanded hopping closer. The human and sebacean each took a step back to stay out of his tongue range. \"You help me search for my son, then betray me for the PeaceKeepers!\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Woah, Big Guy,\" sputtered Crichton. \"We did not two-time you.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We would never betray you,\" yelled Aeryn insulted. \"After all that we've been through-\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Then why am I bound as a prisoner,\" interrupted D'argo, still in the thrall of the hyper-rage, \"and who the frell is that human behind you?\" The two turned around to stare at the tall man in black who looked more than a little confused.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Uhh\xE2\x80\xA6I'm\xE2\x80\xA6gonna go upstairs now,\" the man said shakily turning toward the stairs and leaving hastily.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Um\xE2\x80\xA6that was Angel,\" said Crichton. He appeared to be about to explain further but D'argo didn't give him a chance.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Another one of your bounty hunter friends? Going to show him how my blood runs clear?\" he demanded harshly. What was that man doing here, that human? What would they do to him trussed up and unable to defend himself? He strained against the ropes but they were securely tied, probably by Aeryn.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"D'argo, no. He's here to\xE2\x80\xA6\" Crichton started.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"To dissect me as those other humans did Rygel?\" he yelled furious at the very thought of being the object of some scientific inquiry. How could they betray him? his hearts screamed. It hurt more than he ever thought it could.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"D'argo, just listen to us!\" shouted the ex-Peace Keeper. No surprise that she had gone back to her old ways, he thought bitterly, the hyper-rage still influencing his mind. \"We had Zhaan sedate you-\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"So you could keep me from Jothee!\" he bellowed. He tugged on his ropes some more and with a great roar managed to pop one of the cords around his arms. The others loosened a little bit but held fast as D'argo roared again in frustration. Rage surging through his blood, pounded in his brain.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"D'argo, shut the frell up and listen for once!\" Crichton shouted.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Untie me!\" the Luxan demanded.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"No,\" screamed back Crichton. \"This is the reason we had Zhaan sedate you in the first place. This is the reason we tied you up once you were down. We will not have you acting like the Tasmanian Devil when there are no access shafts around!\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"So you fear for your lives,\" said D'argo with an evil sneer. It pleased him that they were worried about what would happen, what was going to happen when the ropes were gone.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Yes, and for yours,\" said Aeryn sharply. \"We didn't want you down here because you stand out too much. You would easily be caught and slaughtered by a troop of soldiers. We are not going to let what happened on that fake earth happen again!\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"I don't need your protection, PeaceKeeper. I've seen what that's worth.,\" he snarled back. Aeryn stiffened, the blood draining from her face. D'argo knew deep inside that he had really hurt her but his enraged self didn't care. How dare she say they were concerned for his safety. What about Jothee's safety? What were they doing for him?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"D'argo,\" snapped Crichton, taking a protective step in front of Aeryn, \"believe it or not we do care about you. We knew you'd come down here in hyper-rage, like this and start shooting and shouting in a language no one on this planet understands. You remember what my people can be like! You would have been out like a light faster than lightening. And what about Jothee? What kind of life will your son have if the only person he has left in the universe is dead?\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The tall Luxan had no reply. Rai G'arin, his old comrade, was the only other person Jothee had known as family, and he was dead. Could he bear not to see his son again before he died? So many cycles of not knowing what had happened, of not seeing him grow up. He had been a little boy, barley out of infancy, when Macton had ruined their lives. The stabbing pain of those cycles began washing away the blinding rage as the tears came to his eyes. He blinked furiously, trying to hide them from his shipmates.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"We value you too much as a friend to let anything happen to you or your son,\" continued Crichton. D'Argo, guilt and shame at his foolishness now overcoming his rage, knew that the human's words rang true. How many times had they risked their lives for each other and strangers in need?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"You should have at least asked me first,\" he finally said sullenly. His Luxan pride would not allow him to back down so easily.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Would you have listened?\" said John with a smile teasing the corners of his mouth.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Does he ever listen?\" asked Aeryn wryly, as she approached the bound Luxan. She pulled a small knife from her boot.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Aeryn,\" D'argo said, suddenly remembering his earlier words. \"I'm sorry for what I said. I do trust you.\" Aeryn smiled broadly and the remaining tension flowed out of her body.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \"Thank you,\" she said cutting the cable around his arms. \"Now I don't have to kill you,\" and with that she flashed him a wicked grin.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Crichton laughed. \"Finally! Someone else in her doghouse!\" D'argo and Aeryn just looked at each other and shrugged. He was Crichton after all. Somehow that thought made D'argo feel better. Yes, he was Crichton, and he would help find Jothee no matter what the cost."

    Section 17: Boom Ship<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>What a mess, thought Jack. The floor was slick with pale blood and gore. It was more carnage than they were used to seeing fighting Jaffa and for all he'd seen, Jack still felt a little sympathetic pain.</p>
    <p>Aeryn was kneeling on the floor next to the prisoner with D'argo standing over her shoulder. The incomprehensible talking that had been going on for the last ten minutes had finally stopped, the interrogation over. Stark appeared then, coming out of nowhere from the other end of the hallway. Jack and Teal'c watched as he took Aeryn's place by the dying man while she stepped back with her fellow warrior.</p>
    <p>Jack moved to join them. "What's going on?" he asked just loud enough for the two of them to hear. It had been a boring wait for them to finish.</p>
    <p>Both Aeryn and D'argo looked at him with eyes marked by sadness. "He's easing his passing into the next world," Aeryn replied, equally soft. She turned back to Stark who was lifting the mask that hid the right side of his face. A golden glow poured from his face to the murmuring of his words. The soldier stared at him wide-eyed at first but he slowly relaxed and then died with peace.</p>
    <p>"He has passed on," Stark said in a strong voice that held none of the insecurity Jack associated with the man. He replaced the mask and refastened the clasp around his neck. Feather light fingers ghosted down the side of the soldier's face one last time before Stark rose. With bright eyes, he turned to them with his half crouch returning. "Did he tell you about the ship?"</p>
    <p>"Ship?" asked Jack as Aeryn and D'argo exchanged a look.</p>
    <p>"Explosions," Stark whispered. "To stop capture. Big. . . terrible . . .fire that tears, melts, burns . . ." His single eye danced manically, flittering from Jack to the others as his hands acted out their death.</p>
    <p>How the hell did he know that? Jack wondered wildly as the crazy man went on again about explosions and fire. He would have laughed it off, questioned just how he knew if Aeryn and D'argo hadn't sprung immediately into action.</p>
    <p>"John, we have a problem!" D'argo barked into the open air.</p>
    <p>"What?" the other human's voice came back.</p>
    <p>"That ship is going to explode."</p>
    <p>"Why am I not surprised?" Jack heard Crichton sigh.</p>
    <p>"I'll go talk to Pilot," Aeryn said to D'argo. "If it's shielded the only way we're getting rid of it is by spacing it."</p>
    <p>"Wait a minute. Are you sure?" Jack put out a hand to stop her.</p>
    <p>"Stark is. He sees their thoughts when they die." She shook off his hand.</p>
    <p>And things just kept getting weirder and weirder. Talk about the Twilight Zone. "What's our timetable?" he asked instead as Aeryn left.</p>
    <p>D'argo looked at Stark who stared back muttering, "Fire inside . . . outside, dead, all dead . . ."</p>
    <p>"Stark, how long?" D'argo grabbed the quailing man by the shoulders, shaking him roughly to get his attention.</p>
    <p>"Long time, no time, no time . . . soon." Stark blinked slowly, turning his gaze to Jack and Teal'c. "Soon we will die," he whispered soberly.</p>
    <p>"Great," said D'argo. He shot a look at Jack and headed off after Aeryn. Jack took that as invitation to follow.</p>
    <p>"So what's the plan? We gonna take off then eject the ship?" asked Jack.</p>
    <p>"If Moya and Pilot have recovered enough to take off."</p>
    <p>"What?" Jack grabbed D'argo's arm, spinning him around to face him. "We can't take off?" The 'worse' of this situation had just gotten worse.</p>
    <p>"We *might* not be able to," the alien replied.</p>
    <p>"Then let's make sure we can," said Jack forcefully. They did not win the first battle just to die in an explosion. Not on his watch.</p>
    <p>"We'll see - "</p>
    <p>"Ahh," Jack cut him off with a raised finger. "No bad thoughts."</p>
    <p>D'argo just rolled his eyes, muttering "Humans," as he turned back down the corridor.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>John joined them in Command a short while later with Daniel and Sam in tow.  "So?" he asked Aeryn coming up beside her.</p>
    <p>"They're going to try. Moya's been using most of her reserve energy to heal, but it's been five days," she said softly.</p>
    <p>"After serious trauma?" John sighed. "Let's just hope we're not trying to fly on broken wings."</p>
    <p>"Pilot?" Aeryn called and his purple image appeared in the clamshell. "We're ready."</p>
    <p>"Initiating now," said Pilot with a quiet strain in his voice. Around them Moya's hum increased as her drive engines fought to overcome her own weight and launch herself into space.</p>
    <p>"Come on, Moya, come on," John chanted. She could do this, she had too. They would literally be sunk if she didn't.</p>
    <p>"Why aren't we moving?" asked Jack from the strategy table.</p>
    <p>"It may . . . take a while," said Pilot.</p>
    <p>"Well can't we do anything to make it move? You know, bail out the water?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Back off Jack," said John. "They're trying."</p>
    <p>"I'm just saying, if we can help we should," Jack shot back defensively.</p>
    <p>"We've done all we can, it's up to Moya now. Her and Pilot."</p>
    <p>"I hate waiting," Jack muttered.</p>
    <p>So did everyone, thought John. And the wait just kept getting longer.</p>
    <p>"Pilot?"</p>
    <p>"It's . . . too much," Pilot panted. "Moya can't . . . "</p>
    <p>"Well try harder!"</p>
    <p>"Jack!" "Colonel!"</p>
    <p>"If she can't, she can't," John snapped over his shoulder. "We'll have to find another way."</p>
    <p>"I'm going to the Den," said Aeryn giving his hand a quick squeeze.</p>
    <p>"Let's go, John," D'argo sighed. Pushing off the console, John spun and headed out of Command with his friend.</p>
    <p>"Pilot, can you scan the ship?" he asked, the other humans falling into step beside him.</p>
    <p>"We can help," said Sam when he looked at her.</p>
    <p>"Can't let you have all the fun," added Jack with a sarcastic smile.</p>
    <p>John grinned back. "Cause diffusing a ship that could blow us to hell is so much fun."</p>
    <p>"Ahh," Jack waved a finger in his face. "No bad thoughts."</p>

    <p>Sometimes Friedrich liked to take him like that, their bones still humming 
      from the stretch and push of the Change, minds still more wolf than human. The 
      broad hands running up his flanks would wake his skin to a different kind of 
      life, the switch from pain to pleasure screaming over too-raw nerves. The mouth 
      opening, crushing into his own would still taste of their prey for the evening, 
      calling to the wolf even as the sensuous tongue woke the man in him, the two 
      for once caught in perfect, paralysing balance.</p>
    
    <p> Sometimes he hung suspended for long minutes between his two worlds, and sometimes 
      the harmony was more ephemeral, both sides struggling for advantage, pulling 
      his mind apart as the Change did his body, and he felt madness not far away. 
      They would fuck roughly then, against the wall or on a bed of cold leaves and 
      moist earth, smell of panelling or humus filling his nostrils as Friedrich's 
      cock filled him from behind, pounding relentlessly as Gabriel clawed for purchase, 
      limbs barely recalling their shape and direction, the only certain, focussed 
      part of him the one connecting him to Friedrich. </p>
    
    <p>Sometimes it frightened him, not knowing his own body, and Friedrich would 
      sense it, and clamp his teeth into Gabriel's neck and tighten one arm around 
      his waist, claiming him in human and wolf fashion, and the terror would subside. 
      Sometimes, Gabriel simply snarled his defiance, gathering strength to him until 
      he could push back to meet the pounding rhythm in his ass.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes, Friedrich growled and bit, hard enough to draw bruising or blood, 
      and Gabriel knew he'd wear the marks for days under fur or cotton. Looking at 
      them later, feeling the tingling rawness in his ass, he would wonder if the 
      balance or the wiping away of pain or the claiming or the sex itself was the 
      reason Friedrich grabbed him at these times, but such thoughts never mattered 
      with Friedrich's cock drilling into him, Friedrich's chest hair soft as fur 
      crushed to his back, Friedrich wrapped around and in and through him.</p>
    
    <p> Sometimes Gabriel came, senses overloading and blacking out, and woke loose-boned 
      and drained, too tired to move from Friedrich's embrace. Sometimes he barely 
      hardened, the sensations too much for his flesh to encompass, and he would feel 
      Friedrich stiffen and jerk, pressing into him hard through his own orgasm, then 
      pull out gently and stroke Gabriel with hands and tongue, soothing him like 
      a cub, and they would exchange lazy kisses before drifting to sleep still entwined.</p>
    
    <p>Always, Gabriel was satisfied, wolf and man where they belonged, both content 
      sleeping in his skin, and the shadows they hunted would wait for another night, 
      and the rightness and wrongness of his world were banished back to the depths 
      of his mind.</p>
    
    <p>For a time. </p>

  content: "Bridges 6: Six Hours Till Dinner<p>Author's Notes: Thanks once again for everyone who reviewed and to everyone reading and enjoying Bridges. I love hearing from you because it lets me know what's confusing and what people are looking for in my story. So just a few things I'd like to respond to.</p>\n\
    <p>1. Before everyone panics, yes there will be more SG1 interaction in the next few chapters (but this is a Scooby chapter, so be patient). There's still a lot more to come.</p>\n\
    <p>2. Xander and Jack's lives, including secret lives, are on a collision course. All I'm going to say is be patient and remember the story is still primarily about their relationship.</p>\n\
    <p>3. I have not forgotten about the NID or the Initiative (haven't sorted it all yet out yet, but definitely not forgotten).</p>\n\
    <p>4. For Dr. Shubert, I'm glad you recognized the horse ritual. For everyone else, I don't have a direct reference link for the Indo-Europeans, but what Daniel said is essentially true.</p>\n\
    <p>5. For Marcus Rowland, I actually haven't watched Angel in about three years, so I only vaguely know from fic that Andrew visited LA, but that's about it. I chose Rome because I recently saw *Roman Holiday.* Also, as I said in my first author's note, for this story, Spike died when he closed the Hellmouth. (I don't like the fact that they brought him back on Angel.  I feel it negates his sacrifice to some degree.)</p>\n\
    <p>6. For Miss Kayl, as far as Willow and Sam are concerned, they did a background check. There's no reason for them to think they need to do more, especially if Jack and Xander haven't asked for more. The way I see it, doing computer hacking/research takes more time than either of them have with full time jobs.</p>\n\
    <p>***************** Six Hours Till Dinner ****************</p>\n\
    <p>Xander decided unequivocally that he hated the holidays. Name any holiday, any holiday at all, and he could tell you ten ways a demon had ruined it. Anything that was a cause for celebration for humans had its equivalent in demon societies. Take Thanksgiving for example. Every family in America sacrificed a turkey for health and good fortune, just like each family of big, fat, and slimy gathered in the old, abandoned YMCA building across the street sacrificed a person to their big, fat, and probably slimy god for the same reason. And he had thought that maybe this year would be different. But nooooo, here he was, two in the afternoon on Thanksgiving Day with his battleaxe and a crossbow waiting with Willow and Giles for Buffy's signal.</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy and Dawn had come across a pod of demons abducting a woman Tuesday night. They hadn't been able to beat much out of the creature they had kept alive other than he there was some big annual sacrifice planned for the full moon, which of course was Thursday. And unfortunately they had no idea at the time what the demons were, what the sacrifice was supposed to do, or where it was going to happen since none of the Hellmouth's alarm spells had gone off. Thus they had spent the last two days and nights around the dining room table doing research. And with everyone home for the holiday for the first time since Sunnydale, not to mention Jack, Buffy was in full holiday mood and determined to have a normal Thanksgiving dinner.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander had slept maybe eight hours since Tuesday, any available nap time having been commandeered by Buffy for chopping vegetables, mashing potatoes, or making gravy while the other cooks in the kitchen \xE2\x80\x93 namely Willow and Giles \xE2\x80\x93 brewed a potion that would null the effects of the consecration or something. Xander was a little fuzzy on the details. All he knew was that Andrew had saved all their asses when they had run out of eye-of-newt by first suggesting then braving the supermarket for fishheads and the eyes therein. Xander just hoped the substitution worked cause they really didn't have time to kill the several hundred demons. Robin and Faith were flying in at three, Jack at four, and poor Andrew and Dawn, under protest, had the rest of dinner to get finished and the house to clean until it was social-worker perfect.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander almost wished Jack wasn't coming so they didn't have to worry about cleaning up. Though it had been he who had had to remind everyone in the first place that keeping his military father in the dark was probably a prudent idea at the moment. It wasn't that he didn't like Jack, he did, but he was still unsure of how he would react to all of a sudden being told that vampires were real and there was an army of superpowerful girls destined to fight them. After the whole fiasco with the Initiative, no one, not even Xander was willing to risk the girls, especially when they were on their own and far from the Scoobies' protection. Everyone had gone home for the school year except for Vi and Diana who were both survivors of Sunnydale with no other homes to go to. It was funny how things hadn't settled down much.</p>\n\
    <p>\"They're ready,\" Willow broke the silence in the car.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Guys?\" Buffy's voice echoed inside his head as Willow included him and Giles in the telepathic connection. \"Once the fighting starts give us a few minutes to get everyone occupied.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You got it,\" Xander thought as the three of them gathered their weapons and the potion they had to get intact to the focal point of the ceremony. Right. No problem. Happy Thanksgiving.</p>\n\
    <p>******************</p>\n\
    <p>The Cleveland airport was crowded and noisy on the most traveled holiday of the year, but not nearly so much as it must have been the day before. Still annoyed that he couldn't write off visiting his son as a valid reason for needing an F-18 to get halfway across the country, Jack made his way as quickly as he could away from the family of four who's two-year-old had decided that the plane was the perfect spot for a tantrum. He hated flying commercial, but at least he was on the ground now, and would soon be out of here and heading for food. He was a little nervous about spending his weekend in the company of Xander's surrogate family \xE2\x80\x93 he'd have much rather spent it in Colorado in the company of his surrogate family \xE2\x80\x93 but his son had already had plans. Hopefully it would go better than the last time he'd been in town. Just think before speaking, he reminded himself. And don't piss off Mr. Giles. Right. No problem.</p>\n\
    <p>Since Jack had packed lightly again, he didn't bother gathering around the baggage carrousel with his fellow passengers, and instead searched the sea of faces for Xander. But he didn't see him. Probably was stuck in traffic or something.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack! Jack O'Neill!\" a voice, decidedly not Xander's called out over the uncaring masses. He stiffened, eyes immediately scanning for exits and whoever it was calling his name. \"Over here!\" A hand wave from a brown haired girl standing on a chair by the sliding doors. Of course, he shouldn't have been surprised. As Jack made his way over to her he recognized her as his inquisitor from his first visit though he couldn't remember her name. She easily jumped off the chair and spoke to the couple who stood with her, a tall lanky black man and a shorter brunette woman with a couple of bags gathered around their feet. \"Hay, Jack!\" the girl waved at him brightly when he joined them, shifting slightly from foot to foot.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" he replied with an easy smile, wondering if Xander were around somewhere.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm Dawn Summers. We never really got introduced before,\" she said. \"Xander got sent to the store by Buffy and wasn't back by the time I had to come pick them up,\" she gestured to the couple who were looking him over curiously, the woman especially. \"Oh, this is Robin and Faith,\" she introduced them. \"This is Jack.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm Robin,\" the black man offered his hand resolving the first question in Jack's mind with a smile. \"It's nice to meet you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you're Xand's old man, huh?\" said Faith as she too shook his hand. Her voice was low and a little raspy but her handshake firm, a little too firm even. And Jack definitely didn't like that appraising look in her eye that made him feel like an interloper.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're not going to threaten me too, are you?\" he asked warily. \"'Cause I think you'll have to get in line. Buffy's already claimed my arms and Mr. Giles hinted they wouldn't be able to find my body.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Faith smiled broadly at this, her entire demeanor relaxing. \"Guess I'm covered then,\" she said. \"But if I were you, I'd worry about Willow instead.\" Jack raised his eyebrows at this mention of Xander's other close friend he had yet to meet. This was new. \"She'll toast you like flamb\xC3\xA9 if you hurt him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, that's comforting,\" said Jack dryly, which only made Faith grin again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, I can see the family resemblance,\" she said unexpectedly. Jack felt a jolt of warm surprise shoot through him at this pronouncement from a stranger. \"So D, we getting out of here or what?\" Faith abruptly turned to Dawn who jangled her keys and led them out to the car.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So Dawn, how's your senior year been?\" Robin asked as they began walking.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I can't wait till I graduate!\" the young woman told them emphatically. \"But at least there's boys.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack listened quietly while the others chatted about how much Dawn's school sucked. It sounded like a normal teenage rant of a smart kid ready to burst free of the system. Robin asked about her classes and how she was doing in them while Faith alternated with questions about boys. Miraculously, the two threads of conversation never broke as Dawn handled them both with aplomb. It was so different from Sam and Daniel's one-track minds, reminding Jack instead of Cassie's ability \xE2\x80\x93 and Xander's for that matter \xE2\x80\x93 to shift topics with barely a thought between breaths. When Robin asked about college as they merged onto the highway, Dawn just shrugged.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Depends on how the money works out,\" she said. \"I'll probably end up working with Giles.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What does he do?\" asked Jack curiously. Xander had never said exactly and ever since his last visit he'd wondered.</p>\n\
    <p>Dawn glanced at him where he sat next to her in the passenger seat of the car. \"He, um, works with this group in England. Doing book stuff.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Book stuff?\" that sounded a little too vague for Jack. Though Xander had told him Giles had been a librarian.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Research,\" she amended. \"Helping people find what they need to find. Some translations. That sort of thing.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah,\" Jack nodded. Made sense, but still, he felt there was a lot left unsaid. \"So what's he do in Cleveland?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Same thing you're doing,\" Faith answered, staring at him in the rearview mirror. \"Visiting.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, I was just asking,\" Jack defended himself. Jeez, these kids were so protective of the guy. What was up with that? All he wanted to know was what the man did for a living. It was like it was some big secret.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He usually brings his work with him when he's around,\" interjected Dawn before Faith could reply, giving her a look in the mirror. And before anyone could add to the conversation, a phone rang. Dawn immediately snatched up the red cell phone in the cup holder. \"Buffy?\" she answered it, her voice squeaking up. Watching her, Jack noticed that she had tensed up. Then she let out a breath and smiled. \"Good,\" she said. \"I've got everyone. We're on our way home.\" A pause. \"Okay. See you then.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That was Buffy?\" Robin asked tentatively as Dawn hung up.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep,\" the teenager grinned. \"The turkey crisis has been resolved.\" She seemed awfully excited about it for some reason, but then teenagers were fickle about food Jack supposed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, that's good,\" said Faith also letting out a sigh of relief. \"Though I'm sorry I missed it. But right now, I'm so hungry, I could eat a zebra.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You don't like zebra,\" said Robin.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, I do. I had it when we were staying with Nagyia.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That was a beef.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The two of them continued arguing over when they had eaten the zebra, and it wasn't until Dawn leaned over and told him they had just come from Africa that the conversation made any sense at all. \"What were they doing there?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Teaching English and stuff,\" Dawn replied with a vague hand wave. Africa, Jack mused. The first thing that came to mind was Giza and the pyramids. In a way it had been they that had ultimately changed his life by bringing Daniel into it.</p>\n\
    <p>Out of conversation, the two of them fell silent, content to listen to the happy bickering of the couple in the backseat. The trip to the house took longer than Jack remembered, but nonetheless, they arrived intact around five. And as soon as Dawn had parked the car, two people appeared at the front door. Jack grinned when he saw that one of them was Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>******************</p>\n\
    <p>Xander heard a car pull up in the driveway and frantically looked around at the sitting room and open den for any remaining axes or stakes. Or weirdly named books. Or anything else mystical that couldn't be passed off as decorative. He hadn't realized just how much they had lying around until they had tried putting it away. It was a miracle Jack hadn't noticed everything when he'd been here the first time. It had been almost impossible to find space for it all \xE2\x80\x93 the largest repository being the finished basement a.k.a. the Slayer Barracks. But for the moment, everything looked okay. Weapons were in Buffy and the slayers' bedroom upstairs, magical stuff in Willow and Kennedy's room, books downstairs, and weird invoices in the office that served as Giles's room. Pretty much everywhere but the ground floor was a mess. It was a good thing they only had to keep this up for the three days Jack would be here.</p>\n\
    <p>\"They're here!\" Diana exclaimed, rushing out of the kitchen like a cat with its tail on fire. The young slayer had been able to sit still after the fight, and Buffy's Nazi-chef routine was enough to drive anyone that could escape out of the kitchen. Xander could only marvel that she still had energy to burn. He felt like he was going to go narcoleptic at any second now, exhausted from too little sleep and sore from the demon fighting. Regardless, he joined Diana at the open door in welcoming their guests, because, well, he was actually excited about seeing Jack again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Faith!\" Diana shouted, running out to meet the older slayer as she and Robin emerged form the back seat.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey!\" Faith smiled. \"Diana, right?\" she asked as she gave the younger woman a hug.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander followed more slowly while they chatted, getting their things out of the trunk. \"Hey Jack,\" he called cheerfully to the older man, who already had his one bag in his hand.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, it's good to see you,\" Jack grinned back, holding out a hand which Xander shook heartily. He wore his habitual leather jacket and jeans, and looked glad to be there. \"Though you look like you haven't slept in a week.\" Xander shrugged ruefully, if only Jack knew.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, well it's the holidays,\" he said instead.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Xander!\" as Faith as she and the others caught up to them on the walk.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Faith,\" Xander smiled at her. \"Robin, glad you made it this year,\" he shook the other man's hand. \"Long time, no see.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No kidding. I think I'm having reverse culture shock,\" said Robin. \"But do you remember Peter Rhinbald? He's been a great help. He's holding things together while we . . . have this little vacation.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander nodded, glancing quickly at Jack who listened with a mild expression of interest at the unfamiliar name. Xander did indeed remember Peter Rhinbald; he was one of about fifteen of the old surviving watchers that Giles had dug up in the last year that was willing to help out with finding and training slayers. Rhinbald's presence in Africa was the reason Faith and Robin could get home this year for the convening of the Council which would be held next week in the dining room to discuss the state of the mystical portion of the world. But that was still one turkey dinner and three days of freedom away.</p>\n\
    <p>For now everyone simply herded inside to the noisy cacophony that had not dissipated despite the mini-slayers returning home. At the moment, they could hear Buffy and Andrew having a . . . rather strident conversation about how to mix the gravy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, how 'bout you show us our where we're staying first,\" suggested Robin upon hearing the shouting match. \"I don't think Buffy's ready for us yet.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good idea,\" Xander was only too happy to agree. He certainly didn't want to go into the kitchen at a time like this. So he and the girls led their guests upstairs. The house was large with six bedrooms. The master suite was another slayer bedroom where for the holiday Buffy and Dawn would be joining Vi and Diana. Andrew and Xander were next door on the left with the office across the hall where Giles was staying. In the middle was an empty slayer room where Jack would be staying, and around the corner were the last two rooms for the two sets of couples. During the summer all but the guys' room and the office were the home for as many girls as needed to fit since the other residents of Scooby Central were in and out for most of the year.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander let Diana and Dawn show Robin and Faith to the other end of the house while he stayed with Jack. \"So, just ignore the other beds,\" he told Jack, gesturing toward the two sets of bunk beds that lined the far walls. \"Or next time bring your friends.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack grinned as he dropped his bag by the bottom bunk with the pile of linen at its foot. \"Watch out, I just might do that,\" he said as he gave the place the once over. The walls were bare, bereft of the posters and life of the summer. Xander grabbed the sheets and started making the bed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sorry we didn't get to this. It's been pretty hectic around here,\" he said. Jack grabbed the other end of the sheet and helped fit it into place.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No problem,\" he said easily. \"It sounds like you have a pretty wild bunch here still.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And would you believe there's only nine of us?\" Xander shook his head. Had they been this loud back in Sunnydale?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Only nine?\" Jack looked up with a teasing grin.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, you didn't live here with forty-two teenaged girls over the summer, Mr. I-Live-Alone,\" Xander retorted. \"Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in estrogen.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And you have my congratulations for surviving,\" said Jack in such a way that Xander wasn't sure if he was being sarcastic or not. \"So you still working at Home Depot?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep,\" said Xander, tossing him an end of the blanket. \"Still in the lumber yard. I think I'm getting a raise in January. One of the other guys there also does some free lance work and he asked if I wanted to go in with him on a job next week.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That sounds cool,\" said Jack. \"Interior carpentry?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Xander nodded, pleased he'd remembered his specialty. \"I'm looking forward to it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's great,\" Jack grinned at him. \"I always love going back to work after being forced out of things for a while.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"How do you get forced out of work that consists of looking through a telescope?\" wondered Xander at the rather odd statement.</p>\n\
    <p>But Jack just shrugged. \"Not necessarily on this assignment, but you know, in general,\" he said, taking a seat on the now made bed. Xander joined him, thinking again about Jack's blacked out file, both curious and still not wanting to know. He wondered what kinds of Special Forces missions Jack had been on, wondered how much they had helped the country in the unseen war for power that Xander largely ignored. Had it been bad stuff? Worthy stuff? Was it like in the movies where soldiers did questionable things in order to preserve peace on Earth? And if he had liked what he did why had he quit? He was a decorated colonel, he should have had some say about his final posting.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So do you like being out of the action now?\" Xander asked. In their own war against the minions of darkness, to use Andrew's phrase, Xander didn't think he could ever just walk away. Not knowing what he knew, knowing what he could do.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack was silent for a moment, his eyes turned inward. \"We do good work at the Mountain,\" he finally said. \"I don't regret being a part of it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I thought you said it was boring?\" He'd said it several times in fact, and his friends had made fun of him for it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, there's boring, and then there's really boring,\" Jack neatly sidestepped the issue, a fact that was not lost on Xander though he did it very well. \"And the people are some of the best I've ever worked with.\" More points for the subtle shift in conversation. He was actually up there with Veronica on the don't-notice-I'm-not-talking-about-it scale.</p>\n\
    <p>But Xander didn't know how to ask without seeming pushy, so he let it go and chalked it up under the other questions he would ask later someday. \"Daniel, Sam, and Murray?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Jack nodded with a soft smile.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How did you guys meet? 'Cause based on your job descriptions . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack smiled again at the open-ended question. \"Daniel was already working on the project when I got there. We didn't like each other much. I thought he was some geek I had to baby-sit, and he thought I was a military hardass, which I guess I was. It was just after Charlie died and I was pretty torn up inside.\" He looked at his hands and was silent for a second. \"Anyway,\" he went on, \"we had to work together in the field for a while and we ended up friends.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What were you doing?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, you know . . . maneuvers. Testing out his . . . theories and codes,\" Jack waved a vague hand. \"It's still classified,\" he shrugged apologetically. But Xander wondered why the designer of the code would be allowed in the field at all. He was a civilian and a liability \xE2\x80\x93 even on maneuvers that were meant to simulate real conditions. It just didn't sound quite right. But then if it was classified, maybe they had been doing something else, though for the life of him Xander couldn't fathom what they could do like that under a mountain.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Carter joined us about a year later taking no crap from anyone about being the best in her field and a woman. She's got to be one of the most brilliant people I know, including Daniel,\" he grinned again with that contemplative look once more in his eye.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Carter is Sam?\" Xander asked for clarification, not recalling ever having learned last names.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sam, yeah,\" he said softly, turning the apparently unfamiliar syllable over in his mouth. \"I can't say we liked each other from the get-go, but we respected each other. And Murray and me just hit it off when we met. There wasn't a lot of conversation to it.\" Jack smiled again at the memory.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He certainly never said much while I was there,\" Xander agreed. Though he still wasn't sure what bothered him about the man, but there was something just off . . .</p>\n\
    <p>\"DIIIINNERRRR!\" A loud call to the table put an end to the conversation as both men looked toward the door.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You ready?\" asked Xander, with a sympathetic lifting of his eyebrows. He'd worry about the mystery surrounding Jack later. Right now they had to get through dinner without him caging onto any Scooby secrets.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah. Sure,\" said Jack, standing up and stretching slightly. \"How bad can it be?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just don't be afraid to fight for your food,\" Xander advised him. \"They all like you better now since I like you. And if anyone gives you trouble just remind them that I control the house funds.\" But Xander didn't expect trouble. Everyone was just happy that he was happy \xE2\x80\x93 Dawn was even a little jealous. Besides, Jack could charm the skin off a rattlesnake. A house full of people giving him the benefit of the doubt shouldn't be a problem.</p>\n\
    <p>***********************</p>\n\
    <p>It took a full fifteen minutes to get everyone settled around the dining room table. And what an impressive table it was with every available space filled with turkey and potatoes and beans and garden salad and bean salad and boiled onions and soup and bread and even more food at the other end of the table. It had been a long time since Jack had been at a real family Thanksgiving with twelve people. Xander gave him a whirlwind of introductions in all the hustle and bustle, and he barely remembered the names to go along with the blur of faces. Though he did notice that the only blood relatives here were Buffy and Dawn and himself and Xander. But watching them as Faith and Robin got passed around for hugs or handshakes they had missed earlier, as Buffy and Andrew still squabbled over whether or not the gravy was ready, as Xander poked fun at Giles, and the girls giggled and stole carrots from the salad bowl, he could see how close they were. They were their own family, like he and his team were family.</p>\n\
    <p>And finally they were all seated. \"Oh my god! Wine!\" Buffy exclaimed as soon as she sat down, immediately jumping to her feet again, her eyes as round as saucers at this new crisis. \"We have wine, right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's in the cleaning cabinet,\" said Giles calmly who sat at the head of the table with Buffy on his left. The young woman sprang from the table and into the kitchen.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So that's where it is!\" said Xander across from Jack. \"I thought someone,\" he glanced pointedly at Dawn and Vi next to each other on his left, \"had sneaked it.\" The two girls looked up with innocently outraged expressions that he would even suggest such a thing.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, no, it was me,\" Giles said a little embarrassed at having been caught out and the kids immediately started asking if his nerves were becoming too delicate in his old age and other, equally insulting things. Buffy returned in the midst of this, a happy look of relief that everything was finally ready to go.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Buffy,\" said Dawn with a meaningful look at her sister while the wine bottle was passed around.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, right,\" said the other girl. \"Hey everyone,\" she called over the micro conversations which quickly dried up. \"Okay, so Dawn and I wanted to try something new this year before we get started.\" She looked across the table at Diana on Jack's left. \"It was a tradition in Diana's family to go around and say what you're thankful for and we wanted to do that this year.  I hope that's okay.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Clearly stunned by the suggestion, Diana simply nodded. And Jack wondered why she wasn't with her family now. Her and Kennedy and Vi, though with the English girl's accent he wondered if she was related to Giles at all. Xander had told him about Buffy, Willow, and Andrew \xE2\x80\x93 and Robin and Faith had clearly been on their own for a while \xE2\x80\x93 but the other girls were still teenagers, hardly at an age when they stayed at a friend's house for Thanksgiving.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay, so I'll start,\" said Buffy. \"And if someone says yours you have to come up with a new one too. I'm thankful that everyone made it today and that I've gotten to have a nice long visit with everyone, Xander and Willow and especially Dawn.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think that was two,\" said Xander who was next, eliciting smiles and a few chuckles.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, it's a new tradition,\" said Buffy. \"We're allowed to make mistakes.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay, so I think I'll add my voice to the I'm thankful everyone's here chorus I can tell is coming. And I'm thankful that I survived this summer \xE2\x80\x93 and today,\" more grins from everyone, \"and I guess mostly I'm thankful that I met Jack this year.\" His son looked directly at him and smiled softly. Jack felt an intensity build between them and it was just the two of them in the world for that one second. And when the torch passed on to Dawn at Xander's left, they smiled and both turned their attention to the young woman who was thankful that she only had 112 days of high school left before she graduated.</p>\n\
    <p>Vi was thankful for her aunt who had let her take this exchange year in the States (which explained to Jack why she was here for Thanksgiving but made very little sense as to why her guardians were young twenty-somethings with unstable jobs.) Robin came next with a thankful for Africa, the continent that had enchanted him, and for Faith, this last said with the besotted smile of one in love to which Jack internally rolled his eyes. Andrew at the foot of the table was much more dramatic.</p>\n\
    <p>\"As head culinator for the Xena-like warrior women, I would like to take this opportunity to be thankful for the trials and tests of strength that have proved my quality and shown that I would never have taken the ring or anything else of corrupt evilness no matter how much good I thought it could do.\" Jack looked across at Xander to see his response to this . . . interesting and nonsensical speech. The one eyed man merely shrugged and grinned with the others who rolled eyes in the way of those exasperated but fond of their friend's idiosyncrasies.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew \xE2\x80\x93 \" Faith began, but the young man kept going.</p>\n\
    <p>\"*And,*\" he said pointedly, glaring at her, \"and I'm thankful for you guys being . . . you know . . .\" He trailed off uncomfortably, then added, \"and for the Thanksgiving parade because it was cool and I'd never been to a parade before.\" This sparked a few comments about the parade in general before they continued on with Faith who was thankful for surprises and second-chances and Kennedy who was thankful for being back and getting a chance to hang out more with Vi and Diana.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And I'm just glad we're off the road,\" said Willow, the red head next to Jack whom Faith had warned him about. Since they'd sat down she'd been tossing quick glances at him when she thought he wasn't looking, much as Xander had when he had come to visit. It was a little annoying but at the moment he couldn't do anything about it. \"Not the road was bad or anything,\" she quickly looked at Kennedy and grinned. \"Just good to be back home with everyone.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Then it was Jack's turn and he suddenly found all eyes on him from behind pleasant but guarded expressions that still weren't sure what to make of him, this stranger in their midst. Hell, he didn't know quite how *he* felt about being this far outside of his comfort zone. \"Well, I guess you all know what I'm thankful for,\" he said lightly. \"Finding Xander and being given a chance to get to know him. It means a lot to me.\" And it did. Jack felt so . . . lucky, especially sitting here with all these kids whose parents weren't here.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I guess it's me,\" said Diana next. \"It's been forever since I've done this. And even though it's all different, it's just the same. So I guess I'm thankful for thankfuls because they're a little bit of home I haven't had since . . . and I don't know why I'm crying,\" she smiled through tears that slid silently down her cheeks.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey now,\" said Xander softly. \"If you keep that up you're going to dilute the taste of the food.\" Diana laughed in a short burst, wiping her eyes with her napkin.</p>\n\
    <p>\"But then\" added Jack seriously, \"she wouldn't have to add salt.\" The gentle teasing led to a few more smiles as finally Giles took the floor.</p>\n\
    <p>The Englishman raised his glass of wine and looked around the table at everyone before speaking. \"I'm thankful \xE2\x80\x93 grateful even \xE2\x80\x93 that you are all here, safe, alive and well. And I'd like to propose a toast to Diana's parents for such a wonderful tradition, and to all others loved and lost who cannot be here today.\" Solemnly, they all rose their glasses in a silent tribute. Giles's words touched a place deep inside Jack where memories lived, giving them air for a moment of pure sunlight and tasting bittersweet with the wine as it slid down his throat. Across from him Xander had closed his eye briefly, his mouth twisting into a sad smile when it opened and met Jack's gaze. And when he looked at Buffy to Xander's right and Dawn to his left and the others around the table, Jack felt the undercurrent of shared grief like a gentle wave \xE2\x80\x93 and he wondered again about the lives of these kids that had left this kind of mark.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think the food's getting cold,\" Dawn broke the spell. \"Let's eat. I declare it turkey time.\" So they ate, the graveness giving way to the clank of serving spoons on porcelain and the sputter of conversations, mostly about the food and if more could be passed along. Xander hadn't been kidding when he'd told Jack to fight for his food. With the way the girls seemed to eat, they would easily demolish the immense quantities of food on the table. Not all of it had gotten around yet, too much of the food on the closest platters already on everyone's plate. And for the first few minutes everyone just ate. Somehow at the far end of the table, the zebra conversation started back up with Andrew delightedly asking a hundred questions about it and the lions in Africa in general. Eavesdropping, Jack concluded that Xander was right, Andrew was an odd person.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So Jack,\" Willow turned to him after a few minutes. \"How did you track Xander down?\" Jack looked over at the bright, interested expression on the young woman's face that was marred only by some nasty parallel scratches along her jaw.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow,\" said Xander like he didn't want her to ask at all.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What? It's a perfectly reasonable non-threatening conversation starter,\" the young woman turned to her friend. \"It's not like I'm telling him that I'll turn him into a turnip if he hurts you.\" She gave Jack a sideways look, and he couldn't help but smile as Xander again sighed her name in exasperation. Here they went again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"If I ever hurt him you can turn me into a turnip and feed me to a rabbit,\" Jack told her. Willow smiled at him then turned back to Xander smugly as if she had won an argument, which Jack supposed she sort of had.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow, I like Jack. He of the good, non-asskicky type.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Asskicky?\" Jack lifted his eyebrows. Was that even a word?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep,\" Dawn confirmed to Willow. \"And if he had a sticker it would say 'Inspected by number ten.'\" Jack was glad he wasn't the only one who looked up at this odd statement. \"You know, like a sweater,\" Dawn clarified.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, I'm sure Colonel O'Neill enjoys being compared to a sweater,\" said Giles dryly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack,\" he offered the other man the courtesy of his first name feeling a little out of his depth. A sweater?</p>\n\
    <p>\"And I don't want to scare him away,\" said Xander with a grin for Jack he was only too happy to return.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Scary?\" said Willow, her voice squeaking higher. \"I'm not being scary am I? Am I Kennedy?\" she turned to the girl on her other side.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, baby,\" Kennedy laughed, taking Willow's hand reassuringly. \"You're not being scary.\" Jack blinked in surprise at this new development, caught off guard by the display of obvious affection.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I'm glad you came,\" said Buffy, pulling his attention back from the couple at his side. \"You get extra points for showing up.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Points?\" Jack smiled nervously at the idea. \"You keep score?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Don't worry, you're doing fine,\" Dawn reassured him, though he was hardly reassured. Now he felt like too many people were watching his every move and waiting to see if he messed up; it was a little eerie when he thought about it. On the other hand, Buffy's show of support was a nice change from the outright suspicion of his previous visit.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So how long have you known Xander?\" Jack asked Willow, hoping to deflect the conversation away from himself.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Since kindergarten,\" Willow replied with a fond look at his son who in turn looked horrified.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh no. No. We are not doing this,\" Xander shook his head wildly. \"Willow, I'm warning you . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>But Willow was ginning excitedly and Jack just knew he was about to get a whole lot of childhood dirt. And he was right, starting with how the two kids had met on the first day over spilt milk \xE2\x80\x93 Xander's all over Willow. Things quickly deteriorated from there, and Jack had the luxury of listening while he ate to 'the time when.' He heard about another boy named Jesse who joined them in first grade, and a girl named Cordelia who was rich and the leader of the mean little girls who constantly terrorized the trio. He found out that Xander was a goofy little kid but with a loving heart who had once snuck out of his house and run all the way to Willow's because she had gotten sick and had left school early. As the others were reminded of stories from their own childhoods, they chimed in allowing time for Willow and Xander to eat. And so they worked their way through dinner.</p>\n\
    <p>Eventually, the other dishes got passed around the table. Willow passed him the soup bowl as she recounted the time in middle school when Xander and Jesse had tried to build a water balloon slingshot. Smiling at the image of the two boys getting completely soaked when the slingshot failed, Jack dished out some soup \xE2\x80\x93 and jumped in surprise with an, \"aaahg!!\" A fishhead with no eyes floated in his bowl. And it was very, very disturbing. Who the hell cooked fishhead soup for Thanksgiving?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew,\" Diana giggled, answering the question he had accidentally asked out loud. The young man in question waved timidly from the other end of the table while the others laughed at Jack's expense at having been the first besides Andrew to actually put it in his bowl.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do I even want to know why it doesn't have any eyes?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, that wold be a big no,\" said Xander who looked uncomfortably at Willow. And Jack noticed that the lighter mood of a minute before had tensed up suddenly for no apparent reason.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I guess it's good that it can't see its about to get eaten,\" he commented, poking the head with his fork. \"Though I don't think I'm going to eat it either.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you sure you don't want to try just one little bite?\" asked Andrew. \"It won't bite back. See?\" And the kid actually brought spoon to mouth and swallowed a healthy dose of fishhead. Now, Jack had eaten a lot of thing in the name of not pissing off the locals \xE2\x80\x93 but the very thought of having to sacrifice his stomach while on Earth made him his insides shudder at the thought.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think I'll pass.\" He smiled tightly. No way, no how.</p>\n\
    <p>Andrew's face fell and he resorted to mumbling about how no one appreciated fine cuisine anymore. Jack just stared at him. Something was seriously wrong with that kid. Conversation picked up again, this time centered around Andrew and the stranger things he cooked, both a mixture of what had turned out and what hadn't. Soon Andrew himself was joining in with self- criticisms and references to the Iron Chefs, and Jack added his own edited versions of strange food he'd eaten on missions with MRE's at the top of his list.</p>\n\
    <p>Before Jack knew it, he was feeling happy and stuffed and Buffy was serving pumpkin pie and ice cream. Xander was the first to yawn, followed by Dawn, the effects of the heavy meal making themselves known, even at such an early hour. Jack for his part was content, pleased to have met Willow and heard some stories, pleased that Xander's friends had welcomed him this time \xE2\x80\x93 even if he had been threatened again. And though his friends hadn't been there, it had been a good Thanksgiving.</p>\n\
    <p>******************</p>\n\
    <p>The house was finally quiet. Good food, good company, and utter exhaustion had Xander laid out and half-asleep on the couch in the den where he and Jack had ended up. Buffy and a few others were still cleaning up in the kitchen. Giles was making tea. Willow and Kennedy, Dawn, Diana, and Vi had gone to bed, the week and the day finally catching up to them. Xander was surprised that all of them had lasted as long as they had. For his part, he felt like for the last few hours he'd been running on nothing but sugar and excitement. Warm on the couch, he pushed up his sleeves and closed his eye in contentment and let sleep dance seductively across his eyelids.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander can I ask you something?\" Jack asked a few minutes later, his voice edging in on his trance.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, sure,\" Xander rolled his head against the back of the couch so he could see Jack. The older man was in one of the armchairs, a pensive look on his face.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I was just wondering how Willow got those scratches on her jaw,\" he said, and immediately Xander woke up. \"They look like fingernail marks.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Sitting up slightly, Xander wasn't sure what to tell him. Because it certainly wasn't going to be 'because we were fighting demons earlier.' Jack watched him as he pushed himself further upright, buying time to think. \"She and Kennedy sometimes . . .\" he trailed off, his face flushing at the implication he left hanging.</p>\n\
    <p>But Jack didn't seem to buy it. \"And the cut on your arm?\" He looked Xander straight in the eye. Xander pointedly did not look at the incriminating scratch and resisted the urge to pull down the sleeves of his sweatshirt that he'd stupidly pushed up, berating himself for being all kinds of an idiot. Hadn't they nearly killed themselves cleaning the house to prevent just this? Moron! It was a deep cut near his elbow, too long to be passed off as a cooking accident. Numbed by a handful of painkillers Xander had forgotten about it under soft fabric till now. He couldn't believe he'd been so stupid. \"Xander . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>Caught, Xander didn't have an answer. \"Work accident,\" he heard himself say, the lie sounding hollow in his own ears. He didn't quite look at Jack but he could feel his eyes on him, hurt and curious for secrets Xander couldn't tell him. Buffy's family had locked her up when she'd tried to explain everything, and even though Xander knew that wouldn't happen to him, the thought of losing Jack was suddenly uncomfortable. He was too close to having something . . . he didn't know what but it was there, growing under the surface. And explaining now would only shatter it into a thousand pieces. And that wasn't counting the thousand other lives that might be destroyed because what if after he tried to explain and prove the existence of the supernatural, what if, that little part of his brain wondered, what if Jack accidentally let something slip to his superiors or he told them about slayers. Because after all, how well did he really know the man? That possibility perhaps scared Xander the most. \"It's just a scratch,\" he added.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Some scratch,\" said Jack without his usual humor. When Xander looked up he could tell Jack didn't buy this explanation either. Suddenly the room felt too small for the two of them.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm going to go see if Giles needs help,\" said Xander, and he fled the scene. He needed time to think.</p>\n\
    <p>***************</p>\n\
    <p>Jack scrubbed an angry hand through his hair, cursing himself for a fool for opening his mouth. Work accident, his ass . . . that cut looked like a knife slice. And Xander knew it. And now Jack was worried about how he got it, more so now that his son had run from the question. Question, Jack looked down at his hands. All he had were questions upon questions about his son's life, about his friends' lives that had led them here to this house. Questions about fights and why every kid here had lost a parent or two. He just wished Xander would let him in that last step and *talk* to him. He could say how glad he was to have Jack here all he wanted, but Jack wanted to be more than just a person at the table.</p>\n\
    <p>Giles came in then with Xander trailing behind, his son avoiding his gaze as he retook his seat on the couch. If the Brit was aware of the tension between them now, he gave no sign of it as he passed Jack a mug of coffee. \"Thanks,\" he murmured.</p>\n\
    <p>Giles nodded and sat back in his own armchair. \"Goodness, it's been a long day,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I guess you've been pretty busy with everyone coming home,\" said Jack in an effort to have a conversation. Xander seemed to have gotten over pretending Jack wasn't there but his face was closed off and unreadable. And the sleeve of his sweatshirt was pulled down again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Mmm, yes,\" Giles agreed mildly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you're a linguist?\" Jack asked in a Herculean effort to dispel the silence, even knowing he was going to regret this conversation. For the moment, he put thoughts of Xander and knife fights to the side.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I have studied a few languages, yes,\" said Giles modestly. \"Xander said one of your colleagues was working on codes based on ancient languages?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Daniel, yeah,\" Jack replied. Except for the small fact that he didn't. How was he going to talk his way out of this one?</p>\n\
    <p>\"And yourself? Any interest in the subject?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shrugged. \"Latin's the only ancient language I know. More or less. From school,\" he added. No way was he explaining why he had actually learned a dead language. \"Daniel wanted me to ask where you studied.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oxford,\" Giles replied. \"What was your friend's last name?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jackson, Daniel Jackson. Have you heard of him?\" Jack asked, half-afraid of the answer.</p>\n\
    <p>Giles thought about it for a moment and shook his head. \"Can't say that I have off the top of my head, but I've been out of the loop for a while as it were. What's his specialty?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Egypt.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, sorry,\" Giles smiled apologetically. \"I'm afraid I never really kept up with the Egyptian journals.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Somewhat relieved and oddly disappointed, Jack gave him an sympathetic smile. He could understand not keeping up with boring journals, but of course that probably meant that Giles had been reading other equally boring things. \"So what's your specialty?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Folklore,\" said Giles. \"Quite interesting to actually look at what people believed and the stories that cross cultures.\" Ah, another enthusiast, Jack inwardly groaned, wondering why he had even bothered to ask. \"But if you're anything like Xander, I won't bore you,\" Giles surprised him by saying instead of the long-winded lecture he was expecting.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thanks, G-man,\" said Xander sarcastically from the couch.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Will you ever stop calling me that?\" Giles asked with a long-put-upon sigh to which Xander only grinned and shook his head. \"Yes, well, I think I'm going to turn in,\" said Giles. \"Try and catch up on all the sleep I've missed this week.\" He rose, nodded politely, and took his empty teacup to the kitchen before disappearing up the stairs. It was just the two of them again. The sounds from the kitchen had died down until only the gentle murmur of Buffy and Faith talking in the dining room whispered through to them, to low to understand.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So does this mean he likes me now?\" Jack asked to break the hovering silence.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I asked him to be nice,\" said Xander. \"But yeah, he's not all out against you anymore.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack watched Xander stare at his mug, feeling the distance that had suddenly resurfaced and not knowing how to bridge it. \"Do you know why he decided to become a librarian?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's always been a librarian.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's not an answer.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, it's a loaded question,\" Xander finally looked up, one eye boring into Jack. \"Giles is a good guy.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm not saying he isn't,\" Jack replied, frustrated.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Then what? You keep asking about him one way or another.\" Xander's tone was accusatory, attacking before he was attacked.</p>\n\
    <p>Because I find it weird that you live with your high school librarian, Jack thought but didn't say. Instead he heard himself ask \"What were your parents like?\" Jack heard before he even thought about it. Xander stared at him for a moment, another unreadable expression on his face.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wasn't abused if that's what you're asking,\" he said after a moment. Jack just watched him, relieved yes, but waiting for more, hoping the walls would come down. \"They weren't the greatest parents in world. Mostly they just drank too much and yelled at each other and left me alone.\" Xander shrugged. \"Poor me,\" he deadpanned without a shred of self-pity.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry,\" Jack told him softly, wishing he'd been there. It didn't sound like much of a home, but it was better than he had expected. And then Jack felt angry for thinking that such a compromise was a good thing just because it wasn't the worst that could have happened. It was practically neglect, for crying out loud. And he was suddenly angry at Jessica and her husband at himself for not being there when he should have been. Dammit, why hadn't she told him? Looked for him? Anything?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing you can do about it now,\" Xander shrugged again, looking back into his coffee cup. \"They're gone and I'm grown. I had Willow and Jesse, Buffy and Giles and . . .\" he didn't finish.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you still keep in touch with Jesse?\" Jack asked having not heard the name mentioned until today.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He died,\" Xander answered flatly. He sipped his coffee, not inviting any questions while Jack simply stared surprised before murmuring another empty condolence, which Xander also shrugged off, \"It was a long time ago.\" Jesus. From the stories, Jack figured a long time ago must have been sometime in high school. He swallowed hard, wondering what that must have been like for Xander. No one deserved to lose a best friend during the toughest four years of life.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How did he die?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander hesitated before answering, \"car accident.\" Another lie.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And your arm?\" Jack asked carefully.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is fine,\" Xander gave him a wary look, clearly not wanting to talk about it. Jack ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. This was a side of his son he thought they'd gotten past.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It makes me worry,\" he said honestly. \"I'm not going to hold it against you.\" He just wanted to know what had happened. And Xander just didn't want him to know, for whatever reason Jack didn't understand. \"Look, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. But I'm here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is it weird?\" asked Xander, the wariness still there in his face, shadowed by his eyepatch that also had no explanation. \"All of a sudden having a son?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It was a little at first,\" Jack conceded. \"But it feels right.\" It felt right like taking care of Daniel when he was sick felt right, or making sure Sam slowed down, or making sure that Teal'c was feeling loved. It was as if Jack had merely added Xander to that long list of people who meant something to him and who Jack looked out for, even if he did live in Cleveland.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander wasn't going to tell him about his arm. Or the scratches on Willow's face, or how Jesse had really died. Jack could see that. And it made him feel like an outsider in this house and as if all he had built with Xander over the last few months lay just on the surface. Yeah, he and his son joked and shared a sarcastic sense of humor and got along well enough, but beneath was a responsible man who thought about more than videogames that Jack had only glimpsed in brief snatches. Tonight, Willow had shared a little about the boy he had been, but nothing about who he was now. And that was the man sitting here with him, as much a stranger as when they had first met.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander didn't reply. Instead he sort of nodded and turned on the tv, resolutely ending any further conversation. Jack watched as he shifted down the couch so his head was resting on the back, his blindside firmly toward the older man. Jack took the opportunity to watch as Xander quietly fell asleep, all the while contemplating the mystery that was his son.</p>\n\
    <p>****************</p>\n\
    <p>Xander and Jack were careful around each other after that night. By some silent agreement, they avoided deeper conversations and stuck to the little things like they had in Colorado. But the easiness of that trip was lost in the band of tension between them. And Xander wondered if he should tell him, get it over with since it seemed inevitable now that Jack would discover the truth. But it was still too risky, and a part of Xander wanted to keep Jack as far away from the truth as possible for his sake. Oddly, he didn't want Jack to worry about him. Which seemed to be defeating the purpose in light of what Jack had said. Basically, Xander didn't know what to do, so he did nothing but carry on.</p>\n\
    <p>And it wasn't as if Jack was being completely straight with him about what he did. Though Xander didn't really care as long as it had nothing to do with the supernatural \xE2\x80\x93 and from the sound of Sam the astrophysicist and Willow's discrete peek into their files, it didn't. So there.</p>\n\
    <p>But the secrets still gnawed at Xander while they were at the mall on Friday and watching movies all day Saturday, his own and Jack's. Would there ever be more to their relationship than the light banter that spread like palm leaves over a hidden trap that held the truth below? And if they talked about it, would they survive the fall? Xander didn't know. But he could think of a million ways that it could go wrong.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack left on Sunday morning without them ever having said anything more about it. Xander had been invited again for Christmas, though it would depend on when he got off work \xE2\x80\x93 for both his jobs. As he watched Jack head off for security, Xander sighed and decided that he didn't have time to stress about this whole . . . thing now. What would come would come. He had other stuff to worry about.</p>\n\

    <p>Summary: As Class  Historian, Antonia is determined to make the best high school  documentary her senior year that anyone has ever seen, but the first  few weeks of school bring more to light than she ever expected when a  freshman girl goes missing, the new kid Dean takes an interest, and  old traumas may be the key to the present.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>Antonia took a moment to stare at the front doors of Rockford Senior  High School at five minutes before the first bell on the first day of  school of her senior year. This was it, the beginning of the end.  The big brick monstrosity that had felt like such a prison by May  last year now looked a little forlorn, bustling as it was with  excited freshman and jaded upper classmen. Antonia sighed. One last  year to get through and then she would be leaving.<p>The halls were crowded  as they always were for the morning locker rush. Latecomers were  hastily stuffing their bags while everyone tried to catch up with  latest summer news. Maggie, Antonia's best friend of the last two  years, threaded her way through Hillary's gaggle of worshippers,  waving hello and smiling till she got to Antonia's locker.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Mine's all the way  at the other end of D wing,\" she complained, leaning against the  locker bank with a thunk. \"You'd think they'd take your home  room into consideration when they assigned the damn things.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That would be too  easy and convenient,\" said Antonia as she glanced over her schedule  one more time to make sure she had the right books. English,  European History, Calculus, Study Hall right before lunch, thank God,  Advanced Chemistry, Spanish, and Economics. Afternoons were going to  be painful, she decided. \"What are your first three again?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"We have English and  Spanish together,\" Maggie replied. \"Daniel's with us and with  you in History and Calculus, and Ari and Heather are in Chemistry  with you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Cool.\" Antonia  grabbed the final thing from her locker that she'd put there for  safekeeping while she loaded her bag: the video camera.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You're really  doing this?\" asked Maggie.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yep,\" said Antonia  with a grin. \"I already talked to Mr. Holms and he said as long as  I got written permission from everyone I interviewed and permission  from the teachers if I was going to tape part of their class, I was  'golden.'\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Maggie wrinkled her  nose. \"I hate that expression. Why can't he ever say anything  less lame?\" Antonia shrugged and closed her locker. They walked  across the hall and into their neighboring homerooms where Antonia  immediately went to talk to Mrs. Jennings about filming the first day  of school minutiae. Antonia was Class Historian this year and she  was determined to make the best damn tribute to the Class of 1998  Rockford had ever seen.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>My name is Margaret  Gwen Owens, but I go by Maggie. I'm seventeen \xE2\x80\x93 be eighteen in  October. I'm on the yearbook staff and in the band, and I'm  really looking forward to this year because it's our last and  everyone says senior year is the best.</i><p><i>I'm Daniel  Caldwell. Seventeen. I'm on the cross country and track teams and  my other big activity is the Key Club \xE2\x80\x93 I'm the money-man. I'm  looking forward this year mostly for the running 'cause school  sucks, but I can get behind beating Lincoln's ass on the track  anytime.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>My name is Hillary  Aberole, I just turned eighteen. I'm on the cheerleading squad and  the varsity soccer team in the spring. You really want me to list  all my extracurriculars? Because I'm not sure I remember them all.   Whatever. I do Big Brothers and Sisters, I'm in the Language  Club, in the Student Senate, on the Debate Team, in the History Club,  I started the Rides to Games program, and I plan on joining the  Bridge Club this year. I'm looking forward to this year because  it's school and I always have a lot of fun.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>My name is Jim  Donahue. I'm seventeen right now. I'm on the football team  which doesn't leave a lot of time for other stuff. I'm looking  forward to this year because we are finally going to beat Lincoln  this year, I can feel it. Razorbacks rule!</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>My name is Ashley  Tamm. Seventeen and disillusioned. I'm in band still for some  reason and I do Big Brothers and Sisters at the elementary schools.  I'm looking forward to this school year being over, because high  school sucks.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I'm Jacob Zurchin  \xE2\x80\x93 Jake, please \xE2\x80\x93 and I'm seventeen in three days. I do the  volunteer thing and I'm in a band, my own band that I started this  summer, and I have the sweetest car at school, a black camaro. I'm  pretty much Batman. All the jocks wish they were me and I'm  looking forward this year to rubbing their faces in it, how cool  they're not.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Lunch was always a  crowded, noisy affair with too many people and too little time. How  thirty-five minutes was deemed sane, Antonia had no idea. Study hall  before lunch was a blessing though, because it meant she could get  there early and grab a good table before the hordes descended like  locusts on a banquet. She watched for a good five minutes as the  freshman stumbled around through lines that almost everyone else had  learned to skip in favor of a bagged lunch. The kids from East River  were the ones who tended to buy lunch, cheaper if grosser, not that  Antonia was judging, because she wasn't. It was just the way the  lines were drawn really. She needed to get more of them involved in  the project. Antonia didn't intend to leave anyone out of her  tribute no matter how prickly some of them were.<p>She watched Bianca pay  and turn, catching her eye. After a beat Bianca rolled her eyes and  pointedly turned away to go sit with her friends, a wild obnoxious  group, mostly percussion players in the band who were currently  making the dirtiest jokes they could to make the table of freshman  girls next to them blush. What jerks.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey!\" Maggie  tumbled into the chair next to Antonia; Daniel, Ari and Heather  dropped their bookbags and pulled out lunch a beat behind her. \"Is  that the list?\" Maggie asked as she slid over the piece of paper  Antonia had been brainstorming on to read it. \"Freshman  Impressions \xE2\x80\x93 first day, transition to high school, sports,  Homecoming, expectations, friendships, cliques. Firsts \xE2\x80\x93 kiss,  party, prom, car, football game, concert. Boyfriends and Girlfriends  \xE2\x80\x93 dating, love, sex \xE2\x80\x93 you really think they're going to let you  put sex in there?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I can edit it out,\"  said Antonia, \"but it's not like it's not happening.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Love triangles.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Thinking of reliving  the Pete-Allison-Dave drama?\" asked Ari with a grin. Antonia  grinned back. It had been The Drama of tenth grade and nothing had  topped it since.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Senior Year \xE2\x80\x93  expectations, parents, college, privileges, top of the school,  gossip, Homecoming, Lincoln-Rockford game. That's a pretty big  list.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You really think  you'll get through all that?\" asked Heather.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I have a whole year.   I need to fill it with something, and this is the stuff high school  is made of,\" said Antonia. \"I need to get more people though. I  want everybody at least once, more if I can.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That's close to  three hundred interviews,\" said Daniel. \"That's, like, more  than days of school we have.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You should set up an  open interview time, like, during study hall or right after school.  You know for drop-ins,\" said Heather. \"Ooh, and you should do  candid too.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I want that to be  the bulk of it,\" said Antonia. \"I want it to be like Real Life,  but just the real part.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"This is going to be  awesome when it's done,\" said Ari.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia nodded and  fervently hoped so. This was huge. Today was just the first day and  already she'd filmed homeroom and the beginning of English. There  was so much more to do. How was she going to capture the flavor of  Mr. Falk's strict Calculus class, or the flamboyance that she'd  heard Ms. Irving taught History with? How was she going to get a  sense of the cliques and who could float between them and who was out  of favor of the hive mind? This whole thing would either be awesome  or fail miserably and ruin Antonia's reputation as being able to do  anything at all.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She said as much to  Mrs. Reading at the end of the day when she was doing a quick scan of  the economics posters on the walls, all handmade by students over the  years for extra credit.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You're thinking  ten steps ahead of yourself, Antonia,\" said Mrs. Reading with a  smile.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"But I don't want  it to just be some random documentary about high school.\" Antonia  had watched dozens in the last weeks before school started. They'd  all had a message, something big to say, and she had what, We Were  Here? \"It needs . . . something.\" She didn't know what or how  or anything really. \"A bunch of three minute interviews is not  going to be that interesting.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Well, you have the  school events,\" said Mrs. Reading.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Then it's just  another teen movie. <i>From the eighties</i>. A who's going with  who to the Prom.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Mrs. Reading chuckled.  \"Ah, but first we have to get through Homecoming. You'll find  something, Antonia. You just have to find what pulls everyone  together.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I don't want it to  be a Rockford-Lincoln grudge show either.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"There's more to  life than sports,\" Mrs. Reading agreed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"And band,\" Antonia  added. Speaking of, she better hurry or she was going to be late.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>Freshman year I was  terrified. But in a good way. I'd heard all these horror stories  about high school from my older brothers who made it seem like Dazed  and Confused so my first day was all about being relieved about not  getting picked on. It wasn't like I didn't have friends.  Everyone from middle school was moving up, but it was still daunting  because all of a sudden we were on the bottom of the totem pole  again.</i><p><i>It was fine. I  still knew people in the year ahead of me and older guys from track  and cross country since we all ran together. They were actually the  best, some of the juniors and seniors swung by our hall and made sure  we were doing ok that first week. It's something we still do, you  know. Gotta look out for the team.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Oh gosh, I was so  excited. It was high school, the big leagues. Suddenly a whole  world of opportunity was opened up. My first impression was, oh my  god the boys are tall. It was like we came back from summer break  and even the guys in our grade were suddenly beanpoles. They were  awkward still, you could tell next to the seniors. I was terrified  for a month that one of them would come up and start talking to me  and I'd be all tongue-tied and lame. Now I look around, and all  the freshmen look tiny, even the boys.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Oh man, I just  remember my first practice and how Coach was all, you have to keep  your grades up or you're on the bench. I totally didn't get it,  because school was never that hard. Oh man, I got nailed. Geometry  and Chemistry. I did okay with the English and History because you  don't really need to know anything to get by, but the other two,  it's not like middle school. I spent first semester on the bench  and second working my way off it.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I was actually  looking forward to high school. I was ready to move on, do something  new. Classes were cool for the most part; I loved Geometry. Mr.  Clark was really cool and we had a bunch of fun projects that kept it  interesting. Band was cool too, and we played some really awesome  pieces that year. I guess that's what I'm looking forward to  next year with college, moving on and being somewhere new. I'm  just tired of high school.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Freshman year  sucked. I was such a geek. I'm not even going to tell you what I  was like. If you don't remember me back then, you sure as hell  don't get to know now. It was kind of miserable for a while till I  found some friends, but we didn't hang out after school or  anything. My best friend's a year younger than me so we were split  up that year which kinda sucked.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Antonia groaned when  she saw the homework problems on the board when she arrived in  Calculus. They were all the ones she couldn't get, the questions  that Mr. Falk put up there now to let them know that they were extra  credit and had been a complete waste of two hours last night. If  Antonia had known, she wouldn't have done them. It was Wednesday,  the fifth day of school and already she was feeling tortured. The  bell rang as she slid in her seat beside Daniel.<p>\"Can I just say how  much I already hate this class?\" she said softly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Kill me now,\"  Daniel answered with a sympathetic grin.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Mr. Falk was checking  roll visually with the seating chart so they had a minute of respite  before Antonia needed to bash her head in. Someone was looking out  for them today however, because just as Mr. Falk put his book down,  there was a knock on the door. Antonia grinned at Daniel as everyone  relaxed at the distraction.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was a new kid, tall  and totally hot. He handed Mr. Falk his note, said his name after  prompting \xE2\x80\x93 Dean Winchester \xE2\x80\x93 and then, barely waiting for Mr.  Falk to tell him to sit down, slouched right into the open seat on  the other side of Antonia.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hi,\" she said, a  little startled by his sudden arrival so close. Dean glanced at her,  then at everyone who must be staring at him from behind her. He  nodded tersely, didn't smile, and nothing happened after that  because Mr. Falk called for questions on the homework and no one  wanted to be seen as being overly curious about the new guy. Antonia  watched him from the corner of her eye though. He had a bookbag, but  didn't pull a notebook out of it. He didn't seem to be paying  attention at all really, just staring at the wall, eyelids  occasionally fluttering. He looked like a regular slacker, even had  the grunge look going for him, and Antonia wondered how he got into  Calculus.</p>\r\n\
    <p>When the bell finally  rang, books closing and chatter filled in the space left by the heavy  pall of math, and Mr. Falk called over it, \"Dean, could you stay a  minute?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean obliged and  Antonia heard him get his text book, the syllabus, and a quick  rundown of what was expected. Dean said, \"Yes, sir,\" and  \"thanks,\" and followed Antonia out the door.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Where's your next  class?\" she stopped just outside to ask. Dean looked at her  surprised for a second before raking his eyes up and down, clearly  checking her out. Antonia rolled her eyes and wondered why she even  bothered.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Study Hall. Mr.  Hagler,\" he said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh. That's my  Study Hall,\" said Antonia. She started walking to the senior  lounge and Dean fell into step beside her. Daniel was long gone for  Physics so it was just the two of them. \"So where are you from? I  assuming you're new to town.\" Nosy or not, Antonia was not going  to pass up being the first to know anything about the new guy.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Kansas,\" said  Dean, giving her a sideways glance.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What brings you to  Rockford?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"My Dad's job.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh, what does he  do?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He's a pest  controller. Does consults.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>That was kind of gross,  but to each their own right? Antonia wasn't going to judge or  anything.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Where do you live?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Why, you want my  phone number?\" Dean looked at her sideways, a dirty, knowing grin  on his face that made Antonia want to simultaneously die of  embarrassment and punch him at the implication.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You're a jerk,  aren't you?\" she snapped.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, I'm not the  one who wants to get in my pants,\" he replied with just enough of a  country boy drawl to give him that touch of innocence he certainly  didn't have. Antonia didn't bother answering \xE2\x80\x93 boys! \xE2\x80\x93 and  strode ahead to the senior lounge that was just in sight. Dean  followed, but she refused to acknowledge that she'd spent the last  few minutes talking to him and went and claimed a spot on the orange  couch next to Allison.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Ooh, is that the new  guy?\" Allison asked quietly when Dean walked by giving Antonia  another dirty smirk.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes, and he's a  jerk,\" said Antonia, still smarting. She was not a ho and she  didn't chase after every hot butt like some people she could name.  She was just being polite. He was the one undressing her with his  eyes. Allison listened and nodded.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Boy's are jerks,\"  she agreed. \"All they want is sex and they don't get that it's  not all that we want.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What's he doing  now?\" asked Antonia, not daring to look over.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Allison barely flicked  her eyes over Antonia's shoulder as she had been doing while they  talked. \"He took over half of the blue couch and fell asleep.  Think we should tie his shoelaces together?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia smiled,  relieved. \"That would be funny, wouldn't it?\" Of course, they  didn't do it. Too much risk of getting caught and getting in  trouble, and besides, that would be stooping to his level.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>How would I describe  the student body? I dunno. We're all just teenagers I guess. I  mean, average American and all that. Probably way to obsessed with  TV stars and celebrities than is healthy, but there's not that much  else to obsess over really. All the cute guys are taken by the cute  girls already. I mean, it's not the stereotypical cheerleaders are  queens and the football players get all the girls thing. If anyone's  stereotypical jocks is the track team, girls and guys. Our football  team's not that great, but the track team's gone to State every  year for the past, like, two decades.</i><p><i>Everyone's pretty  cool I guess. I only really hang out with the kids in the honors  classes 'cause that's who I see and it's been that way since  middle school. You know how it is, if you went to Bryson elementary  you were more likely to get into honors. If you went to East River  you generally didn't. That's just the way it is. I'm not  saying they're stupid in East River, it's just they're poorer  is all. My Dad says it's hard to teach school when all the kids  come hungry. So there's that split I guess.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I don't know if  I'd call them cliques. It's not like we turn someone away if  they want to eat lunch with us. There's groups sure, but nothing  exclusive. I suppose if you broke it down there's me and my group  of friends, Antonia and Maggie and their group of friends, Allison  and her group of friends, Jim and his group of friends, Pete and  Ashley and their group of friends, Jake and Tory and their friends.  But there's a lot of overlap. People go back and forth. Dave and  Simon are practically a revolving door as to who they hang out with  but that's mostly because they've usually pissed someone off by  hitting on someone's girlfriend. But you know how friends change.  My best friend in ninth grade was Heather and now she mostly hangs  out with Ari, but we're still friends. We chat at games and stuff  like Big Sisters.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>There's a lot of  different people at Rockford, some of the coolest and some of the  weirdest. Most of the pretty girls hang out with Hillary and Allison  when were not all together in one big group. It's hard sometimes  to eat together. There's the super smart guys like Pete and  Ashley. I don't know how they do it; they're going to, like,  Harvard or something. A lot of the band guys are like that. I hang  out with the football guys a lot, although we're together so much,  sometimes I need a break from them. Wilson and Kyle are two of my  good friends but we only really hang out after games. I went to one  of their parties once. It was nothing like any party I'd been to  before. It was crazy! Cops showed up and everything. First time I  ever saw anyone arrested for underage drinking.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>The student body is  a spectrum, of course. We've got everybody, well, for most values  of white anyway. Not too many minorities really, and most of them  are from East River so we're not doing so well on equality there,  obviously. How many of them are you interviewing for this? There's  cliques, there's the usual backstabbing but no worse than the  movies. The next dance is, of course, the most important thing ever  of ever, but that seemed to calm down a bit last year, at least in  our class. People still care and it's still important, but  everyone's a little more mellow about it now. We know each other.  We've been practically living in each others pockets since  elementary school. Well, I guess we don't all know each other.  There's still secrets, just not the kind people like to think  about.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>There's the cool  crowd, the not cool crowd, and the East River crowd. And let me tell  you, the cool crowd, totally exclusive. They've got some secret  list of rules or something where you have to be at so many parties,  or do this volunteer thing, or play in the band, or play a sport.  The only reason I volunteer is because I need it for college. It's  the reason everyone does it and they're lying if they tell you  otherwise. They're all sheep. Gotta be the same, gotta fit in,  gotta be like them. And if you're not? It's little things. The  wrong time for parties, worst seats at events, the way they look at  you at dances because no one will dance with you. It was lame in  middle school, it's lame now, and I don't give a shit, because I  am who I am, and screw them. I have friends and we like each other  just fine and we don't need them.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Antonia watched Dean to  see where he would go at lunch. He was cute and walked like he owned  the place. No doubt he'd been king of the hill at his old school.  Probably had some skanky girlfriend who put out when he looked at  her. His button down shirt and ratty jeans put him somewhere between  nice and Jake's crowd. Jim smiled when he walked by, no doubt  sizing him up for football. The team needed all the help they could  get, and Dean was tall, about six feet, little more. He wasn't  massive but he looked strong enough to take a hit and dumb enough to  run into someone else headfirst.<p>Dean nodded to Jim but  walked on. He nodded to a bunch of people near where Bianca sat who  all whispered to each other which was kind of weird. Antonia was  still wondering about that when Dean stopped at a table where one boy  was sitting all alone, nose in a book, and hit him on the back of the  head. Antonia gasped in surprise.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Did you see that?\"  she asked Maggie immediately, tearing her eyes away to get her  friend's attention. When she looked back, Dean was crouched over  the boy, had to be a freshman, whispering in his ear. She couldn't  see the boy's face but she could see him stiffen and then slump.  He fished something out of his pockets and handed it to Dean. Dean  grinned, but it wasn't friendly, and then he swiped the boy's  milk carton and headed for the lunch line. \"Did you see that?\"  Antonia demanded again.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Wow. He totally  just bullied that kid into giving him money,\" said Maggie, a little  stunned.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"And stole his milk!\"  added Ari.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Daniel, go over and  check on him,\" Antonia said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What? Who?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"The freshman!\"  said Antonia. She couldn't believe Dean had just done that. \"We  should report this.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Don't you think  you're overreacting a little bit?\" asked Heather, looking  uncomfortable. \"I mean, the kid's not doing anything.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"We can't let him  get away with this. Daniel, go.\" Antonia pushed at his shoulder  until Daniel finally sighed and got up. The boy looked up when  Daniel came over, and they still couldn't see his face, but a  minute later Daniel was back.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He said nothing  happened. He was fine, and said he could take care of himself,\"  Daniel shrugged. \"He sounded okay about it.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Okay about it?\"  said Antonia. She couldn't believe it. Dean had threatened him,  leaned into his ear and said something that had that poor kid scared  or something. It wasn't right. Dean, that smug bastard, was not  going to get away with this. She should tell a teacher, only now it  was too late because nothing was happening and Dean, and the freshman  it seemed, would both deny it. Shit. Antonia settled for glaring at  Dean the whole time he was in line and the last five minutes of lunch  that he spent eating by himself across the cafeteria. He didn't  notice. By the time lunch ended she was ready to go over and give  him a piece of her mind, but she didn't want to make a scene, and  there was the bell so she'd have to do it later. Dean didn't  move, finishing his lunch and was quickly lost to sight.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia fumed all  through Chemistry, wishing she'd said something. She came up with  a hundred different scenarios, the worst of which dissolved into \"Oh  yeah,\" comebacks that she'd never say out loud. She did have the  satisfaction of telling Hillary and Emily all about it though, and  what he'd said on the way to Study Hall.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Emily giggled.  \"Kristen and Kristina are already crushing on him,\" she said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I bet Brad and Keith  are happy about that,\" said Hillary dryly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Well now you can set  them straight,\" said Antonia. Not that it would do any good.  Kristen and Kristina were sluts and a bad boy would only spur them  on.</p>\r\n\
    <p>By Spanish, Antonia was  feeling calmer, mostly because she actually did have to concentrate  in this class and Mrs. Gunther asked her about her documentary  project which was not easy talk about in English let alone Spanish.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't expect  to see Dean again, but she did, at the end of the day. Turned out  that his locker was near hers and he was opening it with a slip of  paper in his hand. Seeing him just made her mad all over again, so  this time she marched right up to him as he was putting his math and  physics textbooks away.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dean,\" she said  louder than she intended.</p>\r\n\
    <p>He looked up, lifted  his eyebrows, and said, \"Antonia,\" back with a little smile.  \"Still trying to get in my pants?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I see right through  you, mister,\" said Antonia, wincing internally at her mother's  words coming out of her mouth. \"I saw what you did to that  freshman at lunch, don't think I didn't, and don't think you  can get away with it either. You can't just go around picking on  freshman just because you're older and bigger. And you are not  God's gift to anybody so you can just quit acting all big and  macho. Nobody cares and nobody cares about you and if you have to  pick on someone half your size then all that proves is that your dick  is smaller than my pinky. Have a nice day!\" Antonia glared at his  gape jawed expression for all of half a second and then spun on her  heel and marched off. She was not fleeing, definitely not, even  though her cheeks were burning because she'd just told off the  hottest guy in school on his very first day and talked about his dick  in a crowded hallway.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Behind her she heard  someone say, distinct from the rest of the wind up of the rumor mill,  \"Dude, what was that about?\" And Dean replied, \"I have no  idea.\" Antonia refused to even dignify that with a glare.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>The first party I  went to was at Jim's house \xE2\x80\x93 his older brother was throwing it  when their parents were away, separate business trips I think, I  don't remember. Anyway, Jim's brother was throwing it and  freshmen weren't supposed to come, but Jim told everyone and it  ended up being the worst kept secret in school. It was huge. They  have that big house up on Maybury, right, and it was decked out with  lights, music, and more kegs than I had any right seeing that night.  The beer was crap and I was too afraid to drink too much and too  intimidated to dance, or, you know leave the wall. I felt so lame  but so grown up.</i><p><i>My first party was  after our first cross country meet, fall of freshman year. I don't  really remember much of it; it's kind of a haze. I should probably  stop there.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Oh my god, Jim's  party! It was his brothers really, but I remember Jim coming up to  me after English and saying, hey, we're throwing a party this  weekend you should come, and I was so excited. In middle school, you  hear about them, someone's got an older brother or sister floating  around, but this was it. It was amazing. The house was so pretty  and there was music and dancing and all the juniors and seniors we're  cool with us there. I even talked to Pat Monahan, remember him?  Tight end? Tight ass? Utterly gorgeous. God, I got blisters on my  feet from dancing until I had to stop and I ended up watching Bianca  make out with, like, well. . . You remember her back then. Anyway!   That was my first party, my first drunk \xE2\x80\x93 you're editing this  right? \xE2\x80\x93 my first hangover. And my first grounding when my mom  found out.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>First party? High  school or middle school? Cause my brother threw parties. He threw  one early freshman year which I promised not to invite any of my  friends to which I totally lied about. I invited everyone, because I  had to send Ray a message, you know. I'm in high school now, and  I'm here to stay. I was not going to stand in his frickin'  shadow, and if I had to steal it from him, all the better. I never  did, but he was cool with me inviting people after that. I think he  liked my friends.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>My first party was  at Pete's house, I guess, where we went through the liquor cabinet  with hours of every bad action movie we could find. I think we had  something like four Arnold movies back when he was a body builder.  There were maybe ten of us and we were in so much trouble when Pete's  mom got home. My first party as everyone else defines it was  probably the third or fourth one of the year. All I remember was  being unimpressed and leaving after Bianca puked all over the dining  table.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I went to my first  party sophomore year. I went with Ben, he was a freshman then, and  it was cool because for once we weren't shut out. No one paid any  attention really, we were just there and a part of it. We got to  drink and guys offered us refills, we got to watch the girls dance  and nobody made jokes. It was all cool.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>By Thursday morning, it  was all over school. What Dean had done, what Antonia had said.  There were scattered whispers all over the place when Antonia walked  down the hall, and Hillary and Allison immediately rushed over with a  couple other people. Maggie was already waiting at Antonia's  locker having heard all about it when Antonia called her last night  to panic.<p>\"Did you really say  his dick was smaller than his pinky?\" was the first thing Hillary  said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"My pinky,\" Antonia  corrected, embarrassed just thinking about it. \"God, I can't  believe I said anything. It was like something just took control of  my mouth.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I heard it was  awesome,\" said Allison. \"He was stunned and you let him know he  crossed a line. I wish I could have seen it.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I can't believe I  said it in public,\" said Antonia. \"This is going to make me the  scary bitch and undatable forever.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No it's not,\"  said Maggie. \"You're just letting guys know that you have  standards they have to live up to. It's not a bad thing.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>A quieting of the hall  drew their attention and the girls all watched with everyone else as  Dean came down the hall to his locker. He didn't look embarrassed  or anything, he just smirked and walked like he still owned the  place. Some people avoided his eyes that roamed everywhere but not  Antonia, though she wanted to because those eyes didn't back down  when they met hers. But she had made a stand and she was going to  keep it, so help her. None of her friends were moving or backing  down either and their support suddenly made everything easier.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia!\" Dean  smiled, broad and charming. \"Ladies. How are you this fine  morning? 'Cause me and my dick, we're fine.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia could feel the  whole hall hold their breath to listen and she prayed that she  wouldn't blush, she wouldn't blush, but there it was anyway.  Damn. But she had made a stand and she'd gone this far once  already. \"Really? I'm surprised you could find it.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh, it was tricky,  me being a bully and all,\" said Dean easily, his smile never  wavering. He didn't flinch or look away and damn him for being so  calm anyway. He was the one who was supposed to be defending  himself. \"I think you still have my balls though.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Startled gasps and a  giggle from the crowd accompanied the blush that Antonia knew had  just turned her bright red. Dean just grinned wider, pleased with  himself, and Antonia hated him so much in that moment . . .</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"But don't worry,\"  Dean went on. \"I'll just get them back from you at lunch.  Later.\" He waved, a twitch of his fingers as the bell rang and  everyone was jolted back into reality and the need to get to  homeroom.</p>\r\n\
    <p>By third period  Calculus, this story was all over school, too. Daniel glared when  Dean came in and sat in the empty seat next to him to which Dean  rolled his eyes but didn't otherwise reply. \"You got a lot of  nerve, Dean,\" he hissed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dude, whatever, she  started it.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"She wasn't the  only one who saw you picking on that kid,\" said Daniel. \"I saw  him earlier, by the way. He has a nice scrape on his arm and a  bruise on his cheek.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean snorted  dismissively. \"You should see the other guy.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm looking at the  other guy.\" It was a challenge, and Antonia could practically see  Dean's hackles rise, but thankfully Mr. Falk chose that moment to  come in and close the door with a solid meeting of wood on wood that  broke the tension. Daniel and Dean studiously ignored each other as  Mr. Falk checked roll. His eyes lingered on Antonia and Daniel's  swapped seats but he didn't comment on it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Questions on the  homework?\" he began and class started. Antonia pointedly paid  attention, ignoring Dean and his lack of notebook and textbook or  anything on his desk. It didn't take Mr. Falk long to notice  either, and he did care.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dean, where's your  homework?\" he asked.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Didn't do it,  sir.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Why not?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean shrugged. \"Busy.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Too busy to do your  homework?\" said Mr. Falk with a frown. Dean didn't even flinch,  unafraid in the face of Mr. Falk's disapproval.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You care to share  why?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean glanced pointedly  at the rest of the class and shook his head. \"No, sir.\" Mr.  Falk looked at them too and only said, \"stay after class,\" before  continuing on with the lesson.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't try to  linger today. She didn't want to give him the satisfaction of  knowing she was curious. Everyone was curious, judging by the slow  looks over the shoulder, but ultimately they had fourth period to get  to and Antonia had interviews to do.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean never showed up in  study hall. He did, however, show up at lunch, at Antonia's table  with a tray loaded with gross cafeteria food.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What are you doing?\"  she asked, startled by his sudden appearance. None of her friends  were here yet and she couldn't believe he'd just sat down with  her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hi, Antonia. How's  you're day going?\" he asked with false cheer. \"Cause mine's  been great. Started yesterday with trying to figure out what the  hell you were yelling at me for. Then I come to school where I'm  greeted by your shining face, and then I get pulled from study hall  to the office, not because I didn't do my stupid math homework, but  because of rumors that I had beaten up a couple kids at lunch  yesterday.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Oh god, it was already  out of hand. Antonia shifted nervously feeling a little guilty at  the exaggeration. Still, \"Daniel saw the kid you beat up,\" she  said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh,\" said Dena  brightly and Antonia had the distinct feeling Wile E. Coyote must get  just before an anvil fell on his face. \"You mean that kid at the  table over there with black eyes and broken fingers currently  cowering away from the beanstalk with the scratched up arm?\" He  wave to her left, his right, where a group of freshman, including a  boy with black eyes and taped fingers, were glowering at yesterday's  freshman. There was no mistake they were looking at him because when  he glanced over, they all looked away and a table of older students,  two over from Bianca's table of seniors, laughed. Looked like  there really was an 'other guy' and the winner was walking  straight for her table.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What's he doing  here?\" Daniel's voice made Antonia jump. He, Maggie, Ari, and  Heather had arrived and were all staring at Dean who smiled  welcomingly at them with that damn smile.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Eating lunch, dude.  Join us,\" he invited as if he wasn't the one invading their  space.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dean.\" The  freshman had arrived, his eyes darting around to Antonia and her  friends before returning to Dean. \"Tell me you're the one who  took all the cash.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I did.\" He turned  his bright smile on the younger guy who made a get on with it motion  with his face when Dean just sat there.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So give me some!\"  He slapped Dean's arm, hard.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Ow! Sam! No need  to get violent, or Antonia here will rip you a new one.\" Dean  turned wide eyes to her. \"Save me from the bully, Antonia! Save  me!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Shut up, jerkface,\"  said Sam, glancing nervously at the rest of them. \"C'mon, Dean,  the line's getting longer, and if I don't eat \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You'll talk my ear  off, God, here.\" Dean dug into a pocket and pulled out some  crumpled bills and shoved them into Sam's hand. \"Make sure you  drink your milk!\" he called loud enough to carry as Sam hurried  off. He got the finger in return and turned back to the rest of them  with his smile going fake and plastic. \"That was Sam. My brother.   Great kid, isn't he?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia waited for the  floor to swallow her. It didn't oblige.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>I want a job I like  but I have no idea what I want to do. I like math okay but I don't  want to be an accountant. Something cool, maybe computers. Build  websites or something. I want a family someday, too. Meet a guy who  isn't creepy or weird, or . . . you know. We both should have jobs  so we can keep up a good income. Live in a house, have a better  marriage than my parents. Every kid's dream right?</i><p><i>I want to compete,  like seriously compete. Olympic trials, Nationals, whatever I can  get into. I think that would awesome. I'd get out, see the world  a little maybe and just be able to run during the best years of my  life. The rest I'll figure out afterwards, but I think I could do  it.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I'm looking  forward to college for a lot of reasons, mostly just to see what it  is I want to do. I want to try and go out of State if I can, but not  too far, because I know I'd miss my folks. You hear so many things  about college, how there's so many opportunities and beautiful  campuses, and you get to do what you want when you want to. I'm  looking forward to that freedom. That responsibility. My parents  still think I need my hand held to cross the street, and it's  annoying. So yeah, go to college, meet a guy, have a family. That's  pretty much the plan.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>My future plans  include making it through high school. It'll be alright. I want  to go to college but honestly, I don't think my grades are there.  Who'd take me? We have an average football team and I'm  certainly not a star player. All the scouts go to Lincoln. They  don't care about us. I'll probably go work at the hardware shop  where I work in the summers. Hillary I think is planning on sticking  around. She's applying to Milton which is only an hour away. It  could be good.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>College. Far away.  East or West Coast, whoever will take me I'm out of here. I don't  know what I want to do yet, but as long as it's someplace new,  someplace out of here, I'll be happy.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Well, don't let  this get out too much, but we're thinking of hitting the road, me  and the band. We're good. I think we're good enough to get  picked up, we just have to go after it, you know? We'll have to  get a van. Ben's looking into it. He's going to see if he can  graduate early to come with us, or we'll wait around for him, get  jobs, save up some money. If it doesn't work out, it's still  something to put on a college application, you know?</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>If lunch Thursday was  awful, Friday was miserable. It wasn't that everyone thought she  was a bitch or an idiot. In fact, several people came up and told  Antonia that they were glad she stood up to him, even if it was a  misunderstanding.<p>\"That took guts,\"  said Jim after History. \"Wilson told me that Dean's brother  started the fight over basketball court rights and the only reason he  didn't get his ass handed to him after he knocked out that other  kid was because Dean was watching the whole thing twiddling a knife  in his fingers.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I heard the whole  reason they moved here was because Dean just got out of juvie. Clean  start and all that,\" Larry chimed in.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Really?\" said Jim.   \"Naw, you're pulling my leg.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No really,\" Larry  insisted. \"Kyle told me after practice yesterday and he lives just  down the block from them.\" The boys split off down the hall still  arguing over how full of shit Kyle was, and Antonia and Daniel went  on to Calculus.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You really think  that's true?\" asked Antonia. It sounded more like an out of hand  story that got passed along one too many times. Dean had only been  in school for three days after all, and God, what a mess already.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean showed up in  Calculus right before the bell rang and slid into the seat beside  Daniel giving Antonia a bright grin. \"Hey, did you miss me? I  know you couldn't spy on me after school and everything. It must  have killed you,\" he said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I wasn't spying on  you,\" Antonia hissed around Daniel as Mr. Falk checked roll.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So checking me out  then,\" he smiled cruelly. \"Afraid you lost your chance there,  baby.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Don't call me  that,\" was all Antonia could reply before Mr. Falk started class.  She could feel Dean's slimy grin and the slide of his eyes over her  even as she pointedly turned away and ignored him for the rest of  period. What right did he have to call her 'baby' anyway? And  why was he even talking to her? She'd apologized at lunch  yesterday; he hadn't left their table and instead just chewed with  his mouth open and stared at her while she and her friends tried to  have a conversation. He'd interrupted every five seconds to ask  who they were talking about \xE2\x80\x93 in an effort to change the subject  Heather had told them about Kristen and Brad's blowup in the  parking lot. The fact that the fight had probably been about Dean  had killed that thread pretty quickly and left them in uncomfortable  silence until Daniel started spouting track stuff that he usually  avoided for the sake of the rest of them. Dean took a perverse  interest in it that Antonia was sure was just to piss them off.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Now it seemed that Dean  was determined to keep it up. He followed Antonia out of Calculus to  study hall, talking all the while about how ugly the floors were, how  stupid the motivational posters were, and look at that couple holding  hands \xE2\x80\x93 did Antonia want to go over and ask if they were having  sex?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What the hell is  wrong with you?!\" Antonia spun and demanded when \"Shut up,\"  \"Leave me alone,\" speeding up, slowing down, and outright  ignoring didn't work. They were right outside the door to the  senior lounge where Dean at least was clearly visible through the  window.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Just making  conversation,\" he said with that stupid fake innocence he probably  thought made him look adorable but which really made him look like an<i>asshole</i>.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't bother  to stifle the groan of frustration as she pushed through the door  that didn't have the courtesy of slamming in his face. In fact, he  followed her right up to the orange couch where Allison was waiting  with Kelly and Keith, today's interviewees.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So what's all  this?\" Dean asked, pulling up a chair and dropping his bag onto the  floor. Everyone looked at Antonia who pulled out her camera and  refused to answer. If she didn't give him the attention, he would  give up. Keith answered however.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It's a documentary  for the senior class,\" he said. \"Antonia's Class Historian and  she's going all out this year.\" He grinned stupidly at her,  faltering a bit when he finally got that Antonia was glaring daggers  at him for even acknowledging Dean. Boys were so stupid sometimes.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh, yeah?\" said  Dean. \"What kind of documentary?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Keith glanced at  Antonia again before shrugging and saying, \"Interviews, slices of  life, but not just school, you know? It's just the interviews so  far, right Antonia?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" she said,  short and clipped. \"You ready?\" She stood up and finally looked  at Dean. \"You're in my way.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh. Excuse me,\"  he drawled, not in the least sorry. But he did move, slowly and  fractionally, forcing Antonia to edge him out by getting into his  space. He grinned that stupid grin the whole time, even when she  said, \"You're disgusting,\" and kicked his bag after him. It  was surprisingly light and felt empty, which figured since she'd  never actually seen him take anything out of it, not even a pen.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was Keith's first  interview so it was pretty straight forward. The easy questions that  didn't need to be asked in private after school. Normally, Antonia  didn't mind doing these with spectators, but with Dean watching it  was like having someone peering into your window when you were  showering. He was stranger. He hadn't grown up with them, gone  K-11 with all the same teachers and shared memory of their class. As  much as she was determined to not let it bother her, it did, and  Antonia asked Kelly if they could do hers tomorrow.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I need to study for  my Spanish quiz,\" she said apologetically. She didn't, of  course, she actually did her homework unlike some people, but Kelly's  eyes flickered to Dean, and Antonia knew she understood.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So documentary,  huh?\" said Dean when it was down to just her and Allison on the  couch.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes. Now leave me  alone,\" she said not looking up from the book in her lap. He  wasn't too good with hints.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That's cool.\"  Wasn't too good with clue-by-fours either. \"So you're what,  interviewing every member of the senior class, see what they have to  say about the joys of high school, shed a tear for nostalgia. That's  sweet.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I wouldn't expect  you to understand,\" Antonia told him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Really? Why's  that?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Because you have no  respect for anything,\" she snapped. \"I said I was sorry for  yesterday, and I just want you to leave me alone.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Gonna put it in your  little documentary?\" he asked. \"How you screwed the new kid on  his very first day? 'Cause I gotta say, it's the worst  hospitality I've had in a long time, and believe me, I've had  some shitty welcomes.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, well, you're  not paying me, so I don't have to be nice to you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Ooh, ouch. I'm  hurt, really.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Go away.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>But of course he  didn't. Antonia stopped answering and Allison finally got up with  a sympathetic glance and went somewhere quieter. Antonia was tempted  to follow her but the way today was going, Dean would follow her, and  anyway that would mean that he won this round. Her sigh of relief  when the bell rang was cut short by the knowledge that Dean was going  to follow her to lunch too.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She did have a ten  minute reprieve while he waited in the lunch line. She saw his  brother there as well, not needing money today. When her friends  arrived, Antonia sighed in relief. \"Save me!\" she said. \"Dean  won't leave me alone.\" But other than an out and out fight,  there was nothing they could really do, so they all watched Dean  approach with his tray and join them with that stupid smile of his.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey. I didn't get  all your names yesterday.\" Then to Antonia's complete shock, he  was nice and polite. He shook hands with Heather and Ari, nodded to  Maggie and pretended he'd never argued with Daniel. After the  morning she'd had trying to fend him off, it was surreal. He even  kept his mouth shut when he was chewing. It wasn't until he winked  at her that she realized he was just doing it to piss her off again.  Win her friends over \xE2\x80\x93 not that they would go \xE2\x80\x93 while she knew it  was all a game to him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The simmering  frustration was put on hold, however, because Bianca was coming  toward them. Antonia watched, surprised. Bianca never sat on this  side of the room, in fact, she'd already put her tray down on her  usual table.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" she said,  taking a step back in her path as if she'd just noticed them  sitting there. \"Dean, right?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean looked up and  smiled at Bianca. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Dean Winchester.\" He  held out his hand for her to shake which she did.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Bianca. You just  moved into my building. The Crying Girl's apartment.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean chuckled and  nodded. \"Oh yeah? No crying there anymore,\" he said. \"What  floor are you on?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"First. One-C. We  should hang out sometime. I can show you around.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That would be  great,\" Dean smiled, practically offering Bianca to jump him. It  was disgusting.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'll see you  around then,\" she said, smiling back. Bianca glanced at the rest  of them. \"Hey, Antonia.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey.\" Antonia  didn't dare look away.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I heard you were  doing a documentary of the senior class.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, that's  right.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Ever gonna interview  anyone from our side of town?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Of course,\"  Antonia snapped, but Bianca gave her a look that said, 'yeah,  right' that only pissed Antonia off more. \"When do you want to  do your interview?\" she asked because she wasn't going to let  Bianca think she was afraid of her or anything.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Bianca actually  blinked. \"You want to interview me?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't, she  really didn't. \"Yes.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"All right then. I  guess I'll see you around, too,\" Bianca said, her eyes glittering  coldly. She left and headed for the vending machine, the one just  past their table and on the opposite side of the cafeteria from the  one she usually went to. She ignored Antonia all the way there and  all the way back to her table.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"She seems nice,\"  said Dean, snapping Antonia back to his annoying presence. He wasn't  grinning though, and the look he gave her made Antonia feel like he  was he was peeping in the shower again. Antonia twitched away and  shared a look with Maggie, wishing he weren't there more than ever.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" she said,  not sure if she was agreeing or not.</p>\r\n\

    <p><i><b>Seriously, these  are your first questions? Fine. My name's Dean Winchester. I'm  eighteen. I'm new. Don't do extracurriculars. Don't care  much what happens in school this year. I'm only here because my  dad won't accept GED as an answer. There. My hatred of school  saved for posterity.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>After lunch, Antonia  was finally able to get away from Dean. She remained in a bad mood  for the rest of the day anyway. It wasn't like she was excluding  anyone from the documentary. She'd given Mr. Cleever the  announcement that anyone one who wanted to be interviewed just had to  tell her; it wasn't her fault if no one came forward but people she  knew. She wasn't ignoring anyone.<p>\"You okay?\" Heather  asked as they slid into their seats in Chemistry. Antonia smiled for  her, wanting to ease the worry etched in her friend's face.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm fine,\" she  said. \"Really.\" Heather didn't believe her, but she pretended  to pay attention as class started anyway. They were talking about  electrons and spin and Antonia couldn't help but think that that's  what happened to her a Bianca, the two of them stuck in the same  place in different directions. She stopped before she thought about  it too much.</p>\r\n\
    <p>In Spanish, Antonia  made another announcement about her project and asked for everyone to  spread the word to everyone they know to come do an interview. \"Es  una historia de nosotros.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Hollywood had its idea  of high school with its cliques and bullies and all sorts of  stereotypes that were like plastic people walking around. They ended  up being what everyone thought of millions of high school students,  and Antonia was sick of it. That wasn't who they were, and she was  damned if she was going to let anyone accuse her of doing the same  thing.</p>\r\n\
    <p>By the end of the day  she was ready to make signup sheets and distribute flyers and was  brought up short when Mrs. Reading asked her a question in econ that  Antonia had not been paying attention to. \"Supply and demand?\"  she answered, getting a chuckle from everyone else and a reminder  from Mrs. Reading that the day wasn't over until the bell rang.  Antonia managed to pay attention, or at least follow half-heartedly  for the rest of the period, but when the bell did ring she was one of  the first out the door.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia!\" Hillary  called from two classrooms over, hurrying through the throng.  Antonia paused long enough for her to catch up then started headed  quickly to her locker. \"I saw Dean Winchester eating lunch with  you,\" Hillary followed along after her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah? He was  annoying me all morning.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Maybe he likes you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia gave her a  look. Conversation with Dean had been anything but flirting. If  anything, he'd gone out of his way to make her uncomfortable.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He doesn't like  me,\" she said. \"And if he did, I don't like him. He's an  asshole.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So it really was his  brother who got in a fight? Jim and Larry said he just got out of  juvie. Someone on the football team told them. He's from East  River, you know.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, I know.\"  Antonia hesitated before adding. \"He lives in Bianca's  building.\" She focused on finding her English binder. Their first  essay was due next week sometime and she needed that binder, like  now.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Still. Bad boy from  the wrong side of the tracks. It's kinda hot,\" said Hillary.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Would you date him?\"  Antonia decided the binder wasn't worth it. Hillary shrugged, one  shoulder lifting as she cast a look over her shoulder to where Dean  was unloading his bag into his locker down the hall. He wasn't  taking his books home again.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No,\" said Hillary,  turning back. \"Not my type. But you are going to interview him  right? Part of the senior class and all that?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You are a nosy  bitch,\" Antonia closed her locker with a slam and felt like rolling  her eyes. No wonder Hillary had come over here. They were okay  friends, closer when they were younger but these days they had their  own circles that didn't usually overlap unless something else was  going on. Dean Winchester just happened to be the most interesting  thing since sophomore year's love triangle. And Antonia had  unwittingly plopped herself right in the middle of this one.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Hillary just grinned.  \"So says the girl interviewing everyone in school for nostalgia's  sake.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Whatever,\" Antonia  replied. \"Why are you so interested anyway?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Hillary goggled at her.   \"Have you not heard the rumors floating around school? Hell, you  started half of them. Come on. How can you look at that and not  wonder? And you have the perfect opportunity to ask him questions.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So you do want to  date him.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Hillary's huff was  all the answer Antonia needed, though she refused to admit anything.  Interest in boys and dating was one reason they didn't hang out  that much after Antonia broke up with Larry last year. \"I'm just  curious,\" she said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He's trouble,\"  Antonia answered.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So you'll find out  the truth for me?\" Hillary replied, a winsome smile on her face.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"If he wants to do an  interview, I'll do an interview with him,\" said Antonia, not  mentioning that there was no way she was going to ask. If he came to  her, that was a different story.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Hillary smiled  brilliantly. \"I knew I could count on you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia barely  restrained the eye roll as Hillary bounced back over to Emily and her  other friends. The crowds were thinning out and Dean was gone for  which Antonia was immensely grateful. She dodged that bullet nicely.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Another one she didn't.   Bianca was waiting for her by the steps to the parking lot.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So when are we doing  the interview?\" she asked without preamble.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Is Tuesday after  school okay?\" asked Antonia.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I have work at four,  but yeah.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Okay.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Okay.\"</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>I guess we mostly  hang out at Little Tony's by the movie theater. Shops, movies,  food, it's pretty much the only interesting place to be on the  weekends if we're not at someone's house.</i><p><i>Little Tony's with  my friends because they have to best cheese fries ever. And shakes.  With my track buddies we go to Gonzolas to eat after. I think we  kill their buffet deal. But just to cut loose? Tony' s is the  place.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Well, it depends on  who were out with. If it's just us girls sometimes we just hang at  my house. I mean, we're usually all over there to get ready to go  out anyway. When we go out with the guys we usually end up near the  movie theater or the arcade, they always want to play games but we  can get a Coke so it works out.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>The arcade, man.  We've been going there since our parents first let us out on our  own. It has all the old school games plus a couple pool tables for  just hanging out. The only downside is there's a lot of kids there  until dinner time and sometimes birthday parties. But for the most  part, it's the place to be on a Saturday night.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Pete's house or  the park where we can kick a ball around, or the movies, or a  restaurant somewhere. I dunno. Wherever we feel like going. Some  places we avoid because of the company but mostly we hang out  wherever strikes the mood.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>We hang out mostly  at my house, especially now that we have the band. We've kind of  taken over the garage and my dad gives us a lot of crap about it, but  I'm the only one with enough space.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>\"I can't believe  you brought the camera.\"<p>\"Shut up,\" said  Antonia not looking away from her screen as she did a slow pan of  Tony's. It was crowded and noisy as it always was on Saturday  night, but they had scored their usual table in the corner booth.  Chili cheese fries, burgers, and soda to tide them over until the  movie started. Mostly it was just to hang out, a chance to get away  from annoying people at home. If only she could get away from the  annoying people here, Antonia thought fondly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Okay, everyone just  be natural,\" she told them. \"Pretend I'm not here.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia,\" said  Heather. \"You can't just say that and then expect us to be able  to do natural.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Come on, guys.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Give us a minute,\"  laughed Daniel.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Okay, look I'm  gonna go get some other people having a good time on film. When I  get back you better be happy.\" They all laughed, and Antonia took  another drink from her Dr. Pepper then delved into the Saturday  nightlife, high school style.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Mostly it was just  groups of kids from school doing what she and her friends did, meet  over food and talk and gossip about everything and nothing. There  was a lot going on since it was the first week back to school and  people were still talking about vacations and summer flings. Antonia  caught snatches of conversation as she ghosted by. Tom Warren went  to Paris, Amy Patterson had three boys fighting over her when her  family was in Colorado, Marsh Stebbins's parents were separating  again.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia kept her  distance from people to get as wide a shot as possible and to let  everyone have space to act naturally. Standing closer to other  people she also heard about how much someone hated their job, the  price of gas being outrageous these days, and a list of reasons of  how the government was incompetent. Antonia felt like a fly on the  wall, waiting for the secrets of the world to unfold around her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Look at what the  Mayor is saying about that girl who went missing. History of  depression, trouble at school, which obviously makes her a runaway  instead of a victim,\" the woman behind Antonia was saying. \"If  it's someone from East River, it's the family. If it's the  daughter of a 'fine upstanding citizen' it's the bad influence  of East River on a wild and uncontrollable girl. It's ridiculous.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia turned. She  didn't recognize the couple, but the words sent a chill down her  spine. Someone else had gone missing? She quickly turned away  before they noticed her. It didn't matter. The police were taking  care of it. It was horrible and sad but none of her business. She  had a documentary to shoot after all. She wouldn't be able to do  anything about it anyway.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Her friends were still  waiting on her so she went back to them, coming up so that only  Maggie could see her. She got a good shot of them, catching Daniel's  laugh, happy and loud. Her friends were all here; she didn't need  to worry about anything else.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The movie was funny and  just what Antonia needed to get back into her head. It was still  early afterwards and no one wanted to go home so they wandered the  strip mall for a while. A lot of people were still out and the  arcade was crowded with the after dinner crowd.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes, yes?\" asked  Daniel pointing. \"Come on, we almost never go.\" Daniel was the  only one who really liked the arcade out of their group, and he  usually didn't mind when they passed it up, but there was more of a  crowd tonight than usual so they went in. Who knew what they would  miss if they didn't.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Most of the games were  taken and the air hockey and pool tables in the back were crowded  with a bunch of people watching. The football guys had claimed two  of the three tables with track guys at the last one. Daniel went  over to say hi to his buddies and the rest of them drifted after  looking for a place to sit and watch. There weren't many left;  everyone was watching Jim and Keith playing and smack talking. They  were both good and always a spectacle because of the shots they tried  to take.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, I bet you five  bucks he misses that shot,\" said someone nearby. Antonia looked  and saw Dean leaning against a support pole with Larry and Brad.  \"Come on, five bucks,\" he said with that smile that made her want  to hit him, only this time it was directed at Larry who looked a  little nervous and was trying to hide it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You serious?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You see anything  else making this game interesting? What's five bucks anyway?\"  said Dean fingering a bill.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, okay,\" Larry  shrugged. Jim took the shot and made it. Antonia grinned to  herself, and snuck at look at Dean who looked a little put out as he  handed Larry his five bucks. Sucker.</p>\r\n\
    <p>When Dean got lucky on  the next prediction, he was delighted and seemed to think he was  invincible because he upped the next bet and lost. He lost the one  after that and the one after before getting lucky once more.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Whatever,\" he said  when the game was over and he'd lost all his money. \"I bet I  could beat you,\" he said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Larry laughed, having  fun now. \"You got any money left to back that up?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean nodded. \"Just a  sec,\" he said, leaving Larry and his friend for the snack counter  where his brother was chatting with the cashier over a basket of  fries. Dean leaned over and after a brief argument came back with a  twenty and a grin.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia almost wanted  to protest; Dean was gambling away his brother's money, but it was  twenty bucks and besides, Dean deserved to lose. \"This is going to  be fun,\" Maggie nudged her arm, obviously thinking the same thing  as Larry and Dean took over the table from Jim and Keith. They  weren't the only ones who thought so as the crowd started cheering  for one or the other. It was too good of an opportunity to film to  pass up, and Antonia had her camera recording in time to catch the  break.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean turned out to be  not half bad. Larry was better, but the game was closer than she  expected it would be. Larry won.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Double or nothing,\"  said Dean before he could leave the table. \"My brother's got me  covered. That was too close to prove anything.\"'</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Fine,\" said Larry  cheerfully, sensing easy money on the horizon.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Rack 'em up.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The second game was  just like the first with Dean talking to the balls to get them where  he wanted them. It was another close game up until they each had two  balls on the table plus the Eight. It was Dean's turn, and one,  two, three it was over. \"Well, would you look at that,\" he said,  clearly pleased with himself while everyone around groaned because  they'd been rooting for Larry who wasn't a smug bastard when he  won.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, think you could  beat me?\" Jim spoke up. He sized Dean up who stared back for a  second before shaking his head.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Nah, I'm not that  good,\" said Dean. \"Gonna quit while I'm ahead.\" He pocketed  the money and shrugged. \"See ya round.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Coward,\" Jim  called as Dean pushed his way back toward the snack bar. Antonia  followed him with her camera, drifting out of the crowd to get a  clear shot. She was surprised when he just ignored Jim. Most guys  like him would be up Jim's face for saying that in a crowded room,  but Dean didn't. It was like he didn't care.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How much you get?\"  she was close enough to hear Sam ask when he met Dean by the snack  bar.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Eighty bucks,\"  said Dean. \"I need fifty for a stake at the bar.\" He handed Sam  the rest of the money. \"You get groceries, I'll restock the kit  on my way home.\" And the two of them were out the door, leaving  Antonia staring after them.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i><b>Freshman year was  weird. It was like we were all grown up all of a sudden because we  were in high school. It's kind of stupid to think of it that way  now, since all the freshman are so young when I look at them. But it  was like a whole new world, you know? One we could change.</b></i><p><i><b>Ninth grade was  crazy. It's like everything changed that year. Guys I'd been  friends with back in middle school were hanging out with some of the  tenth and eleventh graders who were getting them into trouble. My  mom ripped me a new one when I went with them once \xE2\x80\x93 nothing bad,  prank stuff, but after that we grew apart, and that's when Mr.  Simms got me started on the track team. Said anyone could do it, and  then said I was talented when after the first practice, which . . .  well, I'd never been talented at anything before except trouble,  you know?</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>School wasn't  much different. It was still school. I was still a cheerleader then  but after a while decided that school was more important. I think  what surprised me the most was how much it didn't change.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>The cool thing  about ninth grade was that we were no longer in middle school. It  was a bit weird for me because my older brother moved out. Joined  the Marines after he graduated and suddenly I'm the oldest at home  and my mom needs me to go to the store or pick up Ellie and Brian,  and do all this stuff that I knew Louis did but it never really hit  me how much he did until it was me. And then there was school and  football and everything else.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>You know what  happened in ninth grade. I checked out of everything. School, band  . . . friends. My parents were getting a divorce, they both wanted  custody of me and my sister. My mom had to move to East River  because she couldn't afford the court costs and the house. My dad  moved to an apartment and got us every other week. I got drunk every  chance I could.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>School is school.   Ninth grade was no different than eighth, except I think I went  through five schools that year instead of four. Repeated the same  chapter in Geometry at least three times. One place was on the  Junior High system so I wasn't even in high school there. Didn't  matter. Kids are the same everywhere. All that changes is the  scenery.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Antonia couldn't help  but watch Dean out of the corner of her eye when he came to school on  Monday. The whole thing at the arcade was so weird. Antonia had  watched her tape a dozen times on Sunday trying to figure it out,  trying to figure out why Dean would go to a bar for steak and needing  fifty dollars for it. She must have heard wrong because that made no  sense, but she didn't know what else it could mean.<p>God, she was obsessing  over an asshole. She should just stop. Leave him to mind his own  business and leave her alone. Except now she was curious, and she  couldn't get out of her head the look of relief on his brother's  face when Dean had handed him thirty dollars for groceries. In the  end she didn't go over, just made sure she had everything and made  her way to homeroom.</p>\r\n\
    <p>In Calculus, she took  the seat that would put Daniel between her a Dean again. It wasn't  any of her business, she'd decided, curious or not. Who knew what  someone like Dean was doing in a bar when he was clearly underage.  He'd probably gone to get hammered, only unlike every other  teenager that actually had brains, he went to do it where he could  get caught. The bags under his eyes were probably from spending the  night in jail. Dean slouched into his seat with a sigh.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Man, you suck at  pool,\" said Daniel by way of greeting. \"I can't believe you  lost to Larry.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean glanced over and  shrugged. \"I came out ahead.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Barely,\" Daniel  snorted. Dean shrugged again, his eyes flickering over to Antonia  who quickly averted her eyes, uncomfortable because she knew he'd  gone to a bar afterwards. It was stupid but it made her feel young  for some reason.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Mr. Falk came in and  class started, but Antonia couldn't shake the feeling for the rest  of the period. She kept sneaking glances at Dean in his battered  jacket and scuffed up jeans. He looked like every skater punk,  except the shabbiness wasn't something washed into his clothes.  The bar thing aside, he'd spent almost half that money on  groceries, and that made her feel ashamed for some reason. Hell of a  welcome she'd given him to school when he probably already had  enough problems at home.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Study Hall couldn't  come soon enough, and for once Dean didn't seem intent on bugging  her. Antonia was relieved of course. She certainly had better  things to do than have Dean Winchester slobbering after her. Still,  she couldn't help watching him as he sacked out on the couch like  he had on his first day. She wondered if he had an after school job  or something, or was going to get one. Suddenly she just wanted to<i>know</i>. He hadn't really talked to anyone besides her so far.   Hadn't made any overtures of friendship, hadn't stayed to hang  out at the arcade. Antonia and the stories of the fight his brother  had gotten into kept most people from approaching him which was kinda  mean and sad. Except for Bianca.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" Antonia  turned towards Allison. \"You ever hear of the Crying Girl's  Apartment?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Allison looked up from  the homework she was finishing for Chemistry. \"You mean the ghost  story? Sorta. I mean, I've heard the story about that apartment  building in East River where you can hear a girl crying for her  mother in the middle of the night.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>That was about all  Antonia knew about it, too. She hadn't realized it was more than a  story though. Ghosts weren't real, of course, but the fact that  there was an actual apartment associated with the story was a little  freaky. Glancing over at Dean again, she wondered if he knew the  story. Probably not, and if he did he probably didn't care except  as some lure for cool points. She tried to put it from her mind  because it was stupid and so summer camp, but Antonia was still  thinking about it at lunch.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Do you know the  story?\" she asked her friends.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"This girl and her  mom lived there,\" said Daniel. \"She was a prostitute or  something and one day she just locked her kid up and walked out.  They found her days later.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I thought she was  knifed by one of the men her mom slept with,\" said Ari. \"And her  mom was a crack-whore. Hard into drugs.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"When did this happen  anyway?\" asked Heather.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Sometime in the  fifties,\" said Daniel.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Seventies,\" Ari  correct him. \"No one did crack in the fifties.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So her mother just  left her there and she, what? Starved to death?\" asked Antonia,  not really caring if it was the fifties or the seventies. No one  probably knew for sure, and it didn't matter. Both Daniel and Ari  shrugged not knowing that either.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I bet they only  found her body after it began to rot and smell up the place,\" said  Ari.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How could they  tell?\" said Daniel with a grin.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Guys!\" Heather  gave them both a disbelieving look.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What? It's true!\"  said Daniel. \"I've been to one of those old apartment buildings.   They smell like shit. Real shit.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"When were you ever  over there?\" asked Maggie.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I dropped a couple  of the track guys off after a meet. It was late and the busses  weren't running.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Did you even get out  of your car?\" asked Antonia with a tilt of her head. It was a  building. It couldn't smell that bad.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I didn't need to,\"  said Daniel. \"The place was a dump.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia wouldn't  know. She had stopped thinking about what living in East River might  be like a long time ago.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It can't be worse  than your room,\" said Maggie.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, my room is  paradise in comparison,\" Daniel retorted.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Your room is a  biohazard wasteland,\" Maggie shot back. Antonia agreed with Maggie  but let them argue it out instead of joining in. It was a familiar  argument, one where Maggie was always right and Daniel never changed  his ways.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Across the room, Dean  sat at the end of a table with a bunch of other guys from East River.   He didn't join in on their conversation, but he was listening,  although Antonia couldn't tell if he was a part of the group or  not. He looked the part certainly, and as much as Antonia hated to  admit it, he looked damn good doing it. God, she was pathetic. And  he was still an asshole, whatever was up with the pool thing this  weekend.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It took a couple tries  but Antonia was able to tune back in to her friends who were now back  to talking about what if the CDC was called in because Daniel's  room was such a disaster area and the whole town had to be  quarantined like in Outbreak but without the monkeys, just Daniel's  dirty socks. Her friends were such dorks sometimes.</p>\r\n\
    <p>When lunch was over,  Antonia continued not thinking about Dean and managed to get seated  in Chemistry for all of five minutes before Hillary slid into the  seat next to her and even though she didn't say anything \xE2\x80\x93 Mrs.  Havershield had just started talking about the lab \xE2\x80\x93 she raised her  eyebrow in a question.</p>\r\n\
    <p>No, Antonia shook her.  She hadn't interviewed him and she wasn't going to. She  restrained herself from rolling her eyes and turned her attention  back to the front. It was their first lab and she didn't want to  screw it up after all. \"Do you know the story of the Crying Girl?\"  she asked preemptively when Hillary took the lab bench beside her a  few minutes later.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What? The ghost  story?\" asked Hillary.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You don't know  it?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Just the basics,\"  Antonia shrugged. \"And none of the stories are the same.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It's a ghost  story,\" Hillary gave her a look that clearly said that Antonia was  being slow. \"It's not even true.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It's true.\"  Both Antonia and Hillary looked up and through the shelves that  divided the bench into two sides. Estelle was peering at them even  as she pulled out her beakers and Bunsen burner.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\" Antonia  hoped she didn't sound as surprised as she felt. She hadn't even  realized Estelle was in the class. Not that she shouldn't be.  Just, Antonia wasn't expecting it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"The Crying Girl,\"  said Estelle earnestly. \"In the Bluff Apartments. It was a girl  who lived on the third floor, except she lived next door to where she  was killed.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Who killed her?\"  asked Antonia, leaning closer.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Estelle shrugged.  \"They never caught him.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So it wasn't her  mother?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No.\" Estelle  stopped shuffling her things. \"Who told you that?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Just heard it  around.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No, it was some  guy.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia waited for her  to go on, but that was all Estelle had, apparently, because she  pulled her handout closer and started reading it. \"Why do you want  to know anyway?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Just curious,\"  said Antonia, picking up her own handout to read. They were doing  simple stuff to familiarize themselves with the lab equipment today.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"About Dean  Winchester?\" asked Estelle with a teasing grin. Hillary  immediately swung around to stare at Antonia who was not blushing.  Okay, maybe a little, but not because she was curious about Dean, not  really.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia!\" It was  all the reproof Hillary needed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\" Antonia  threw her look right back. \"Someone said he lived in the Crying  Girl's apartment and I just wanted to know what that meant.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Means he's dirt  poor,\" said Estelle, getting their attention again. \"No one  lasts there more than a few weeks so the rent is rock bottom,\" she  explained. \"People would rather break their lease agreements and  pay the fine than live there.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia looked at  Hillary, startled. Hillary blinked back. \"This has all the  makings of a really bad horror movie,\" she said, and both Hillary  and Estelle snorted.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>My first kiss was  with Daniel. Tenth grade. It was kind of sloppy and gross because  he totally couldn't kiss back then. He got better with practice.</i><p><i>I was dared to kiss  Sandy Belles way back in middle school. Does that count? It was on  the lips but real quick. I guess my real first kiss was Maggie in  tenth grade. I asked her out once and we went to the movies and a  couple parties for about three months. The first kiss was pretty  bad. Too much open mouth and not enough control. She got better but  then we broke up.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Oh God! My first  kiss was too embarrassing to think about. I think I'll pass on  this question.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Hillary Aberole,  freshman year at one of my brother's parties sometime in the  spring. Let me tell you, she can kiss. It's the only part of that  night that I remember.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I haven't kissed  anyone seriously. The one boyfriend I had, I dumped before we got  that far because he was an asshole and just wanted some. Called me a  bitch when I wanted to watch the movie instead of make-out. Simon  left before the movie was even half over. I hear he's gotten a lot  better at conning girls since then.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>First kiss? There's  been so many I can't remember the first. You know how it is.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>It was just like a bad  movie after school. Antonia was half running to her locker, quick  stutter steps that couldn't exactly be called walking unless it was  the Olympics because Mrs. Reading had been in a chatty mood after  class. Antonia loved the woman, really, but couldn't she pick a  more convenient time to ask about the documentary? It was going  fine. She wasn't going to interview the teachers until later in  the year, and she had interviews to get to now. Twisting, Antonia  was already trying to get her bookbag open while she was still  moving, barely paying attention to where she was going until she  rounded the corner and ran straight into Dean Winchester.<p>He caught her before  she fell on her ass, but all Antonia could think was, 'Why her?'   \"Dean,\" she said reflexively. She had managed to not think of  him all day. Since lunch.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia!\" Dean  flashed her his sleazy smile, and Antonia quickly recovered and  pulled out of his grasp.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Excuse me,\" she  said, avoiding looking at him and going to her locker. She quickly  spun her combination, shielding it with her body because Dean had  decided to pester her again.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, I hear you were  asking about me,\" he said shamelessly, leaning against the lockers  beside her. Thankfully, this time Antonia was annoyed enough not to  blush.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Whoever told you  that was lying,\" she said. English, Calculus, and Chemistry for  sure had homework. Econ was already in her bag. She couldn't  remember if there was anything for History or not.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No one told me,\"  he said. \"But I have good ears.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Well, they're  wrong.\" Antonia spared a scathing glance for him but he only  raised his brows irritatingly. Behind him and across the hall she  could see Hillary and Emily watching avidly. Maggie, who would save  her from this, was unfortunately nowhere to be seen.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So it wasn't you  asking everyone about my apartment?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I was asking about  the ghost story,\" said Antonia with a long drawn out sigh because  really, the rumors that got around school. \"And I asked one person  other than my friends. Don't tell me it's a crime to talk to my  friends.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean shrugged like it  didn't bother him one way or the other. \"Why do you want to know  about the ghost story?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Why do you care?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It's my  apartment.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Rent controlled,\"  Antonia said before she could stop herself, and was suddenly  mortified because it was crossing a line, even for someone she  disliked. But when she risked a glance at Dean he wasn't angry  like most people would have been. He was giving her a wry smile.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That's the best  you got?\" he asked, laughing at her. \"If that's supposed to be  insulting you need to go home and practice.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Sorry,\" said  Antonia. \"I didn't mean \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Whatever,\" Dean  cut her off. \"You know, if you wanted to know the story you could  have just asked me.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No one from Rockford  knows the real story of the Crying Girl,\" she said in disbelief.  \"Why would you?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Cause maybe the  landlord knows it?\" he said. \"And maybe I got a dork for a  brother who looked it up.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh yeah?\" Antonia  didn't believe that for a minute, except for the landlord maybe,  but then why didn't anyone else know the story if he did.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" said Dean.  \"Her name was Anna. She lived with her mom across the hall in 3B.  No dad, and her mom worked two pretty shitty jobs to keep them afloat  and had a record for prostitution. Some creep moves in across from  them and a few months later Anna goes missing. They don't find her  till she's long dead. Raped and beaten to death. For ever after  you can hear her crying for her mom.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia stared at him,  books, homework, and interviews forgotten. Until Dean flashed her  that grin again. \"You wanna come over and see her room?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Slamming her locker  shut, Antonia rolled her eyes. \"Go find someone with a little less  self-respect,\" she said pushing past him. He was making it up. He  just wanted one thing after all. Guys were all the same.</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>This is the only  high school in town so we have everybody, the rich kids and the rest  of us.

There's us from East River and  there's the people who grew up rich. Everyone gets along okay but  you don't really talk to people outside your group.

They  always stick together.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I wouldn't call  it diverse but people still stick with what they know. You walk  through the lunchroom and you can tell where someone's lived their  whole life, but it's more than that.

    <p><i><b>Everyone's  pretty cool I think.

    <hr>Tuesday morning Antonia  was half asleep. Yesterday had been a bit hellish when her camera  had run out of batteries in the middle of interviewing Pete and she'd  had to run to the store to get more and Pete couldn't stay late so  she'd have to interview him again. Then there had been History  reading after all and she hadn't brought her textbook home. It was  so stupid of her. Stupid Dean for distracting her with his sob story  that she really hoped wasn't true.<p>But what if it was? It  was one thing when it was the Crying Girl, another when she had a  name. Had she heard her mom looking for her? Had her mom even  looked across the hall? Had she stayed up all night worrying, too  scared to sleep? It had happened a long time ago, Antonia reminded  herself, and might not have been true anyway.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia put her camera  bag on the locker shelf and double checked that she had put the extra  batteries in the side pocket. No way did she want to have to run out  in the middle of Bianca's interview. She might not come back to do  it over. It was going to miserable and awkward and horrible as it  was.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" said Maggie  as she joined her, frowning a bit when Antonia looked up. \"What's  wrong?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Nothing,\" said  Antonia. \"Forgot my History book last night.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Read it in homeroom.   Or skim it. I doubt we'll have a pop quiz today.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"God, I hope not. I  can already feel myself falling behind in there. It's so boring.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It's not so bad,\"  said Maggie, unsurprising since she actually liked History. \"It's  not,\" she added at Antonia's disbelieving look.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The first bell rang so  they waved and spit up for homeroom. Once in her habitual spot,  Antonia pulled out her History book and got to it. They were reading  about the Renaissance and it was all men and politics. Boring, no  matter what Maggie said. She ignored the Pledge of Allegiance and  the Moment of Silence but looked up when instead of the Vice  Principal with the announcements it was the man himself, Mr. Holms.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Students and  teachers of Rockford, may I please have your attention for the  following announcement. Last Friday, freshman student Linda Karlyle  was reported missing by her parents. She was last seen Thursday  after school on the #2 bus. If anyone has any further information on  her activities Thursday please come to the office. All information  will be held in the strictest confidence. I would also like to  caution everyone not to go anywhere alone. Tell someone where you  will be at all times and be safe in your neighborhoods. We here at  Rockford extend our prayers to the Karlyle family and for a speedy  and safe return for Linda. Thank you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Stunned. Everyone was  stunned. Antonia wasn't sure if she was breathing or not. She  didn't notice that more than one person had turned to stare at her.   She was busy telling herself that it would be okay. That the police  were looking for Linda. That she was going to be found. That it had  nothing to do with her. It only took her a few seconds to pull  herself back together and for everyone else to get over their initial  reaction. School went on after all and none of them probably knew  her since she was a freshman. Still, it was a subdued chattering  that returned after the regular announcements finished, and Antonia  couldn't help but feel cold.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>I have plenty of  school spirit I think. I mean, I play in the band so I go to all the  football games. It's one of those things that has grown over time  though. In ninth grade I was much more about the music than the  football, but now that I actually know what's going on on the  field, it's a lot cooler. Even if we lose all the time.</i><p><i>On the track I have  tons of spirit. I want to win, damnit! Off the track, not so much.   The football guys think they're hot stuff but they're not  really, and it's just embarrassing. They expect respect that they  haven't earned. It makes me mad sometimes, because we have, but  since it's not football, no one really cares.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I love this school  and I'm proud I go here. And I want everyone to be proud to go  here because it really is a good school and there are so many  wonderful things it offers. School spirit is about more than  cheerleading for me. It's about my friends and the student body  and making this school the best it can be. I'm in the Senate too  and there's all sorts of things that we do to help give Rockford  students a better high school experience, and that's very important  because it gives them a stronger base for college and the work force.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Hell yeah, I got  spirit! Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who does. Everyone  else disses us and never come to games. We work hard and sometimes I  just wish people would pay attention. It's like no cares unless  you win, despite all the crap teachers always spout about doing your  best is all that matters. No one even cares about the Lincoln game  because no one believes we can win, and it's disheartening.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Rah, rah, rah.  School spirit is such a joke. I can't wait to leave all this  behind. It's high school and I don't care what everyone says,  these are not the best years of my life. They, in fact, suck and all  the talk about loving your school and spirit is so forced and  ridiculous. It's like painting a smile on your face so no one will  realize how miserable you are.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>School spirit is for  all those people who have something here. That's who all the  spirit's for, the sports teams and the cheerleaders. What has  spirit ever done for me? Get me picked on maybe, for not being cool  enough to have something to cheer about.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Everyone was still  stunned about the freshman but trying to hide it. \"My mom's  going to freak,\" said Maggie when they met up again in English.<p>\"Yeah,\" Antonia  agreed. Her own mom was going to more than freak.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I bet she was  snatched while she was walking home from the bus station,\" said Jim  at the end of class. \"Kyle said the police have been all over the  place asking questions.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Someone whose little  sister knew her said she'd been acting strange for a while, and  there was another rumor by the end of History that she had just run  away because she had no friends. That one Antonia figured had been  started by someone who didn't know the girl at all.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She didn't bother  speculating herself. She hadn't heard of Linda before and didn't  want to add anything to the muddle that was out there. \"Maybe she  ran off to join the circus,\" she told Daniel as they went to  Calculus. \"The police will find her.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"But aren't you  curious?\" asked Daniel, a little puzzled.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" said  Antonia, sitting. \"But no one here knows for sure so it's stupid  to keep talking about it.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Daniel was still  looking at her funny but Antonia ignored him and focused on getting  her homework out. Dean came in under the bell as usual, and as  usual, didn't get out any homework. Thankfully, Mr. Falk got  started right away so there was no time for him to open his mouth in  her direction. Seeing him only reminded Antonia of the Crying Girl,  and how she went missing right across the hall from where she lived.  How did people do that, just go missing? Why didn't they call it  kidnapping from the get go?</p>\r\n\
    <p>There was no answer  that Antonia could believe in. Some people were just fucked up.  Already fed up with the day, all she wanted was to go home and forget  everything. But Bianca's interview was still after school and  Antonia wouldn't back down from it. Maybe God would help her out  and Bianca would. She hoped so.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The bell was  startlingly loud when class ended. Antonia had barely paid  attention, and when she jumped at the metallic sound Daniel gave her  another worried look. \"You okay?\" he asked.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" said  Antonia, annoyed because she was fine and she didn't need anyone  telling her she wasn't. Daniel looked like he didn't believe  her, but she didn't give him a chance to pester her about it as she  hurried out of the room.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Study Hall she spent  doing another interview but the whole time she was wondering what  Bianca would say. Thankfully, the camera and the questions kept her  occupied and her mind from wandering too far, but instead of the  usual satisfaction she got with a successful interview, Antonia was  just filled with more dread.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, look at that,\"  said Kelly when she was done, nodding over Antonia's shoulder.  Following her gaze, she saw Dean chatting up Kristen with his smarmy  smile.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Brad's going to  like that,\" Antonia snorted, glad for the distraction.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I doubt she's  serious about it,\" said Kelly which was probably true. Kristen was  a flirt and there's no way she could have resisted Dean Winchester  even if she'd wanted to. Dean looked like he was into her though,  and Antonia smiled a bit at the thought of him getting knocked down a  peg or two. It cheered her up and gave her something else to think  of other than lost girls.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i><b>The first party I  went to as a high school student was the North Pennet Block Party.  It's every year in October but this was the first time my mom let  me go because it's so wild. There's free stuff all over the  place \xE2\x80\x93 food, beer, music. It's pretty cool but was also a  little scary that first time because there were so many people moving  and dancing and I kept getting lost in the crowds. It was fun  though.</b></i><p><i><b>My first party  was when I was ten. I snuck out of the house with my friends  waiting. One of their brothers was letting us come with him to the  party. It was wild. It was a first time for a lot of things. I  think that's where I got my crash course in sex. I though it was  pretty gross at the time because these two people were making all  these embarrassing noises. Nearly scarred me for life. First time I  tried pot. Didn't get high and I puked afterwards, but yeah. I  just thank God my mom never found out. Forget grounding, she would  have killed me.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>Parties are a  weird thing. See when I talk to people in my classes from across the  river, they talk about house parties where it's pretty much just  high school kids. In East River, the whole neighborhood comes. I  don't remember my first. I didn't like it much, and I still tend  to stay away from them unless there's going to be really good music  there or something.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>Oh, man, parties.   I love parties. I don't think they love me 'cause I usually  end up blacking them out. The first one I went to was one down the  street from where I lived. My brother took me and made me stay with  him the whole time. I hated that. I must have been thirteen or  fourteen. But it was still awesome. Lights and dancing and girls.  Lots of girls and they weren't shy, not the ones my brother hung  out with.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>The first party I  went to was that one at Jim's house, freshman year. The one  everyone went to. I remember getting to the keg and being nervous  about the beer. After three it was great because everything was so  much better. Life didn't seem nearly as bad, you know?</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>First Party. I  went to one once in . . . well, some farming town. Smaller than this  place. It was weird. No one did anything except drink and smoke  pot. Even the girls were boring. There was another, later, way  better. The girls there were definitely not boring, and some of  their boyfriends weren't too happy about it.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Antonia had more and  more butterflies show up as the day wore on, and by the time she was  at her locker, getting ready for Bianca, she was ready to screw pride  and call it quits herself. She needed to calm down. Focus. This  was for the documentary. She wanted to tell the story of the senior  class, let them have their voice that was often denied them, and  whether she wanted it or not, Bianca was a part of that.<p>Testing the camera was  probably a good idea after yesterday's fiasco, and besides, with  this morning's announcement she should probably get some reactions  from people. So Antonia shouldered her bookbag and pulled out her  camera. Candid shots, she decided, maybe she would get a few  questions in if people were willing. Slowly, she panned across the  hallway, then slowly she began walking to the main office where she  had permission to do the after school interviews in the conference  room.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Most people looked at  her then ignored her. They all knew what she was doing. A few boys  made faces and some other people waved. Strands of conversation  floated around. Shouts of, \"Wait up!\" and \"Did you hear about  Thomas?\" and more than a few, \"I've gotta ask my mom. With  that girl missing I might not be able to go.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Do you know her?\"  Dean's familiar voice caught her attention behind her. Antonia  froze and focused on a chunk of juniors all bent over something  between them.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No.\" Dean's  brother answered. \"She was shy. Kept to herself. Always had her  hair in her face.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Wallflower, huh?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"She never talked in  class,\" said Sam. \"Oscar told me she sometimes didn't bother  showing up to school.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The sound of a locker  slamming shut made Antonia jump, and then they were walking away and  out of earshot. Time to stop stalling.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Bianca was waiting at  the door to the conference room when Antonia got there. \"Hey,\"  she said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" said  Antonia. They looked at each other for a moment, and Antonia could  feel the years between them. \"If you don't want to do this . . .  with everything that's going on . . .\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Bianca took a deep  breath and said, \"No, it's okay. I want to do this.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Okay.\" Antonia  couldn't say no to that. If Bianca could do it, then she could.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>It's the standard  high school clich\xC3\xA9 isn't it? Every school has a football  team that it's supposed to be ridiculously proud of and all the  popular boys are on it and all the girls want to fall at their feet.  It's just a sport, and I like it as much as the next person, but  it's not the be-all, end-all. Our team doesn't even win that  much.</i><p><i>Why the emphasis on  football, that's what I want to know. It's a stupid sport but  it's the only one anyone cares about and all the other sports get  pushed to the side. Where's the enthusiasm for things like soccer  and track where you don't stop the game every ten seconds?</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I love football.  It's fun to watch, I like the guys on the team, I like cheerleading  \xE2\x80\x93 it's its own sport too, you know \xE2\x80\x93 and I love the feeling of  going to games and being a part of something special. Our team may  not be the best, but it's still our team.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Football rules! But  seriously, I love it. Just playing is such a rush, a real contest of  strength and endurance. You have your team and when you're on the  field, it's not just about you. It's about playing for your  teammates, of not letting them down. It's a pretty big  responsibility when you think about it. And I know we get a lot of  crap for not being the best team. We lose games, but some people  forget how close some of those games are. We're in a tough region,  and we work hard and we play hard and I know that when we walk off  the field we've played our hearts out, win or lose because everyone  on the team plays for everyone else. We're in it together.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>What I like best  about football games is how it brings everyone together. No one  really watches the games and when you're in the band you get stuck  in the stands a bit, but the game is someplace to hang out and launch  the weekend from. Even if they don't go to the game, everyone  still shows up for the end to catch up with their friends and go out.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Oh, not another one  of these! Can't you ask questions about things the popular crowd  doesn't do? Football sucks. It's just another way to let people  know who is bigger, badder, and cooler and everyone else can go screw  themselves.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>It ended up not being  so bad. Antonia asked all the same questions she had asked everyone  else and if the answers were a little harder to hear, she tried not  to let it get to her. But they weren't that bad. Bianca was still  Bianca, still the girl Antonia wondered if she could ever understand.   She was blunt but not cruelly so. It was mostly her and the camera  with Antonia giving her something to talk about.<p>She was nevertheless  worn out by the time she got home, but a good night's sleep and  having it done did wonders for her mood when she showed up at school  the next morning. She even got a chance to properly mock Dean in  Study Hall with Allison and Kelly when Kristen snubbed him for  Spanish homework.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Best yet, seventh  period was cancelled for a pep rally. This Friday was the first home  game and despite the football team being not so great, the school  still wanted butts in the seats. Antonia, Maggie, and Daniel saved  seats for Ari and Heather when they showed up in the gym. As seniors  they had the front rows of bleachers and had to limit their talking.  Antonia had her camera and switched between filming the show and the  reactions of the students, and got a lot of good shots in of both  disinterest and genuine delight.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was all so  ridiculous, Antonia thought even as she clapped for the cheerleaders  who were going through their routines. It was such a strange ritual  when you thought about it. The girls dressed up in skimpy clothes to  drum up support for boys who spent an hour running into each other on  purpose.</p>\r\n\
    <p>After the cheerleaders  were done, the team was introduced, all forty of them. It took  forever, and the cheering got quieter the longer it went on. They  were finally let go \xE2\x80\x93 ten minutes before the end of the usual  school day \xE2\x80\x93 and the masses started pouring out like water from a  broken dam. Done with the pony show, the football players left with  the rest of them, shoving each other and laughing because they were  genuinely excited about their first game. Antonia followed them with  the camera, interested to see if they had any rituals. She'd never  really paid attention to them before except as other guys in her  classes and as players on the field. Now they were players off the  field, laughing and joking and so clearly a pack that thought they  owned the school. It wasn't like the track guys who were always a  pack but quieter about it, watching out for each other. This was  wilder, and when Jim started running and pushing people out of his  way with a whoop when the bell rang, the others followed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>There were yells of  protest and loud cursing that went unnoticed in their wake. Antonia  tried to keep up and keep the camera steady, but she had a feeling  she was bringing back the shaky-cam with this one.</p>\r\n\
    <p>But then everything  stopped like a derailed train. Jim's whooping was cut off and the  sound of people falling to the ground rippled outward through the  crowded hallway. Antonia got to the front in time to see Jim  scramble to his feet in front of Dean who was smirking.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Gotta watch out  there,\" said Dean, all cheerful sarcasm. \"Make sure you don't  run into people.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You tripped me!\"  said Jim, disbelief and anger coloring his voice. Larry, Wilson,  Kyle, and the rest of the football team closed ranks around him. It  didn't seem to bother Dean at all. In fact \xE2\x80\x93 Antonia had to look  away from the screen and up at the scene unfolding in real life  before her \xE2\x80\x93 he looked like he was just waiting for them to try  something. If the football team was a pack of dogs, he was the wolf,  faster, stronger, and ten times more dangerous.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Better watch where  you're going before you start shoving people out of your way,\"  Dean said. \"Some of us don't need a helmet and padding to take a  hit.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh, man, you  didn't,\" said Wilson.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What, call you guys  pussies?\" said Dean with another smirk. \"You think you can take  me, you're welcome to try.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jim went for it.  Lunged, angry and a bit terrifying, but Kyle grabbed him back in time  to avoid him crashing into Mr. Holms and Mr. Falk who were suddenly  there demanding to know what was going on.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Nothing, sir,\"  said Dean who had taken a quick step back with the arrival of the  principal. \"Jim here knocked into me and fell down. Traffic  accident.\" He shrugged and smiled easily, the same smarmy smile he  used on girls and that seemed to work well enough on principals, too.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Mr. Holms looked from  Dean to the football team. Antonia dropped back before he noticed  her with her camera although she kept recording the school discipline  in action. But nothing happened. Mr. Holms just sighed and said,  \"All right. Everyone just go home. And I want no more traffic  accidents,\" he said pointedly to the boys before shooing them off.  Antonia went too, not wanting to be caught staring, but she lagged  behind in the crowd until Dean was in front of her and followed him  to their lockers.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She didn't know what  to make of this new side to him. The whole football team. And he  just stood there like they were nothing. As she watched him saunter  down the hall, she wondered if he could have done it, taken them and  won. But that was stupid, it was like, twenty to one. Even Rambo  needed a gun to even those odds and she seriously doubted that Dean  had any Jackie Chan moves up his sleeves.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam accosted him where  everyone else had given him a wide berth. Antonia was close enough  to hear him hiss, \"You jerk!\" as he shoved at Dean's shoulder.  Dean retaliated by shoving Sam away from him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"They were being  jerks, bitch,\" he said, uncowed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"And if Dad finds out  you've been fighting, he's going to hand you your ass,\" said  Sam. They both stopped at Dean's locker and Antonia turned to  hers, slowly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I wasn't  fighting.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Close enough. Dean,  I like it here.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What, this place?\"   Dean twitched his head to the side. \"Do you have a girlfriend?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Don't fuck it up,\"  said Sam intently, ignoring the question.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean rolled his eyes  and dumped his books into his locker, replacing them with one spiral  bound notebook. \"Relax, Sam. Dad's not even going to find out.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That's what you  said last time.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm not the one  who left evidence for him to confront me with.\" Dean slammed his  locker shut and turned with Sam toward the door, right toward where  Antonia was standing. She was far enough away for denial  plausibility \xE2\x80\x93 she hoped \xE2\x80\x93 as she tried to think of something  that wasn't completely lame to say.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean raised a brow at  the camera dangling in her hand anyway. Antonia smiled sweetly. \"I  see I was right after all,\" she said. \"No brains, all brawn.  What there is of it. You're lucky the teachers showed up.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam snorted and huffed  past her, looking for all the world like a five-year-old. \"You're  just pissed you didn't get to see my hot body in action,\" said  Dean, the smirk once more coming out to play.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No. I've seen you  crash and burn enough for one day,\" Antonia retorted, amazed that  he thought she would even want him. His brother had said it, he was  a jerk. Antonia was wasting enough time on him as it was. There  were no layers here, so she just threw his smirk right back at him  and brushed by him to her own locker.</p>\r\n\

    <hr>Antonia watched the  first two minutes of the segment on the news about Linda. She got as  far as the first interview with her parents before the static  glitching in the sound made the perfect excuse to go do her homework.   She didn't need to see the rest anyway since everyone else at  school had and it somehow worked its way into conversation over the  course of the day. Antonia didn't really pay attention because  today was a good day for filming the goings on of the student body.  Who loitered in what hallways, who sat with whom at lunch. Jim and  his buddies had been bitching about Dean all day and now they eyed  him as he took his tray to an empty table. Seemed that even the guys  from East River were shunning him right now.<p>The girls were another  story, however. Antonia looked back and forth to be sure she was  seeing it right, but yeah, that was Kristen waving at Dean and  getting a wink \xE2\x80\x93 who did that! \xE2\x80\x93 in return. Antonia could  understand it; everyone wanted to bash the football team's  collective heads in at some point because they were acting like they  owned the school, but that didn't mean people had to fawn over  Dean, who certainly didn't deserve it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey!\" Antonia  turned the camera on her friends. \"What did you guys think of what  happened yesterday when Dean nearly got in a fight with the whole  football team?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It was funny,\"  said Maggie, grinning. \"Showed them, right?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I was stupid and  arrogant,\" Daniel countered. \"I know the guys were being  immature, but so what? We were just at a pep rally.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>When Maggie and Daniel  started arguing acceptable post-pep rally behavior, Antonia shared a  look with Heather and got up to see what other people thought for  posterity.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It turned out to be  kind of fun. Antonia circled around the outside tables first,  getting a general consensus that Dean was hot from just about every  table of unaffiliated girls of all ages. From the freshmen and  sophomore boys there was more than a little admiration and joking.  Other responses ranged from, \"Stupid,\" to \"Testosterone  poisoning,\" to a full ten minute rant from Jim and Larry about how  they were going to show Winchester a thing or two and he better be  ready for it. They didn't care if he'd been in juvie, he wasn't  going to know what hit him! They were like puppies, but Antonia  couldn't help but laugh at them anyway.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Near the windows, Dean  was unaware that he was suddenly the talk of the cafeteria. His  brother was sitting with him now, and they were arguing if the glares  between them were anything to go by.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Chill, Sam. It's  just asking questions,\" Dean was saying by the time Antonia was  walking behind him close enough to eavesdrop. Sam, however, had  pinned his eyes on her so Antonia gave him her best  you-wish-I-was-interested look and didn't linger, his eyes  following her the whole time. \"We won't do anything till Dad  gets back,\" was the last she heard of that conversation. As  curious as she was, she didn't dare stay to find out what he was  going to be asking about.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It turned out that she  found out later anyway walking between C and B wings on the way to  Economics. There was a crowd in the courtyard that people cut across  to get to D wing on the far side of the school with Dean and Kyle in  the center of it facing off.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dude, I just asked  if you saw anything,\" Dean was saying when Antonia pushed her way  outside and through the rubbernecking throng on their way to class.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So you're saying,  I'm the one who kidnapped her?!\" Kyle retorted angrily. \"Is  that it? Because that is fucked up.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Well, forgive me for  worrying if there's a psycho loose in our neighborhood,\" Dean  spat back.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"The only psycho  loose is you.\" Kyle pointed a finger at Dean. \"You and your  freaky father. I've heard how he comes and goes in the middle of  the night. I bet he's the one who took that girl.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The words rippled  through the courtyard like waves in a pond, stuttering students to a  halt to turn and stare. Dean froze. His jaw clenched and Antonia  watched his hands fold into fists.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You don't know  anything about my dad,\" he said softly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That's right, no  one does,\" Kyle took a threatening step closer. \"Bet he likes  girls on the side. Wouldn't be surprised if he's the one who  drifted through here and snatched Bianca, too. He ever leave you on  your own for a few days, Winchester? Come back with her dad's  blood on his hands?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean punched him. A  devastating right hook that snapped Kyle's head back and then the  fight was on. Antonia jumped in surprise, shocked as much by what  Kyle had said as by Dean's violent retaliation. For all that it  seemed like time froze, it was over quickly. Kyle recovered enough  to throw a punch back at Dean who dodged and brutally hooked a heel  around his leg and threw him to the ground. Antonia was too far away  to hear what he hissed in Kyle's ear, but then he was up and gone,  people parting before him like the Red Sea. A couple of Kyle's  buddies helped him to his feet only to be angrily shaken off.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The bell rang, making  everyone start and hurry the rest of the way to class, whispers of  murder and kidnapping, and \"Bianca? Really? Who's that?\" from  kids too young to remember.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia stood still  amid it all, trying to breathe, the vivid image of Kyle falling to  the ground overlaid with a middle aged man, falling, crashing down,  head split open. Blood and a wrangled scream.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>It's so hard  sometimes to live up to everyone's expectations. My parents expect  perfect grades. The teachers expect me to get it on the first try.  My friends expect me to be there for them when they need a shoulder  to cry on. Sometimes I feel like I'm always doing for others and  no one's doing anything for me.</i><p><i>On the track team is  where I feel the pressure the most. I've done so well and now I'm  a senior and I can't not do well. I can't blow off a practice  for something else because I'll fall behind. Some of it is  pressure I put on myself because what if I fail? What happens then?</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I'm doing so many  things, it's sometimes hard to balance them all. Cheerleading or  soccer practice versus homework. Debate practice or doing the extra  work for the Senate committee. Don't get me wrong, I love all of  it, except the homework, but sometimes I feel like I can't do any  of it. Or I'll crash and burn and then everyone will know what a  failure I am. And now we've got college applications on top of it?   My mom's already on my case about that stuff.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>The pressure's not  so bad. In football no one really expects us to win, and that's  actually kind of nice for us. We play our best but it's like a  bonus when we win. School's all right. My dad keeps telling me I  should do better, but I'm doing fine. No need to kill myself over  it. A C is still passing, you know?</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>It's all about  college right now. Everything goes on that application and anything  you've screwed up in the last few years means your chances of a  good school are blown. Yeah, it's a little nerve wracking. My  mom's the worst. Every time I want to do something that's a  little bit fun or off the wall, she's like, \"Remember you've  got applications to fill out and grades to keep up.\" As if I don't  know that. I can't wait for second semester when I'll know I've  been accepted somewhere, hopefully, and all this stress will be gone.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I don't care what  other people think. I'm going to do things my way. Mr. Jones  seems to think I'll actually listen to his crap about a \"bright  future if I just apply myself\" every time I have to go to his  office. I don't care about a bright future or business suits or  selling my soul to corporations. I'm a musician. I'm gonna try  to make it with the band.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Supply and demand.  That's all she had to think about right now. Mrs. Reading was  going on about Coca-Cola but Antonia couldn't look away from the  poster of a supply and demand graph. It was very simple really. The  basics of people wanting something and other people willing to give  it to them for a price. Material things. Normal things. Milk,  bread, cars. They hadn't gotten to the Great Depression yet, but  Antonia remembered from History last year about the farmers who  poured out their milk because the price was too low for them to sell  it and the people in the cities starved because the price was too  high for them. No wonder communism had been big back then.<p>Kyle was an ass. And  as much as Antonia didn't like Dean, she couldn't blame him for  hitting him. They were both jerks. Guys were such jerks, and now  everyone was probably talking about it behind their hands so the  teachers wouldn't find out \xE2\x80\x93 it wasn't often a fight went  unnoticed but no one would openly rat it out. The teachers would  find out, they always did, but there wasn't anything they could do  about it now. They'd both lie about it anyway.</p>\r\n\
    <p>God, Antonia didn't  want to think about lies right now either. Supply. Demand. Price  where they intersect, no matter the context. This was a pretty  crappy thing to be thinking about too.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Somehow, she got  through the rest of the class, itchy, annoyed, and watching the clock  the whole time. She'd have to get the notes later from someone who  had paid attention, but when the bell rang all she could think about  was getting away from the madhouse that people affectionately called  high school.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia!\" Hillary  called as she made her way down the noisy corridor. She pretended  not to hear until the other girl actually caught up and grabbed her  arm. \"Did you hear about the fight?\" she asked excitedly.  Normally, Antonia would have been excited about it too \xE2\x80\x93 drama!  Action! A break in the tedium! \xE2\x80\x93 but not now. Not when it was  about Linda and Bianca and she couldn't deal with Hillary the  Gossip-monger right now.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" she said  briskly. \"Look, I can't talk today.\" She hurried on to her  locker.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What? Since when?\"  said Hillary, following. \"Dean punched Kyle and got away with it!  Do you know what it was about?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No,\" Antonia lied.   She spun her combo and hoped Hillary got the hint.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Hillary!\"  Maggie's voice rose above the clamor of the hallway. \"Emily's  looking for you.\" Antonia didn't look up, but she could feel  Hillary's eyes on her for a long moment before she gave up and  left. Maggie came over and took her spot. \"Probably,\" she  added.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia smiled at her  gratefully. \"Thanks.\" Maggie smiled back and nodded in return,  but she still looked worried.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I overheard some of  the guys talking about Bianca,\" she said softly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" said  Antonia, glancing away. \"I don't know if I'm going to make  band practice today.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Game's tomorrow.  You should come,\" Maggie replied. \"Let Mr. Kermit yell at us for  a couple hours.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Put that way it  shouldn't have sounded as good a prospect as it did. \"Okay,\"  she said. Maybe it would be okay \xE2\x80\x93 hell, no maybe about it. She  could go to band practice or be stuck at home with nothing but  homework to take her mind off of things.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I gotta go to my  locker still,\" said Maggie. \"Meet you by the picnic tables?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" said  Antonia, the smile coming a little easier. \"See you in a bit.\"  Maggie left, and Antonia sorted through what she needed for the night  until she got to Econ and had no idea whether there was homework or  not. Mrs. Reading unhelpfully didn't have a regular homework  schedule, so Antonia threw the books in her locker. If there was  homework, that's what Study Hall was for.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean was at his locker  when she turned. His brother was there again, his back against the  locker bank staring at the opposite wall looking just as put out as  he had yesterday. Dean didn't seem to notice.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey!\" Antonia  barked at him before she even realized she had stalked over. His  head snapped up, intent and holding something back that Antonia was  too angry to care about right now. \"You shouldn't have dragged  Bianca into this,\" she said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean blinked but said  fiercely, \"I don't know what you've heard, but we had nothing  to do with anything that happened \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You still brought  her into this, you bastard. She should be allowed to forget about it  and move on and you had to bring it up again.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, wasn't me,\"  Dean threw up his hands. \"That was all Kyle, and why do you care  so much anyway. I thought you hated each other.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Where he got that idea  from, Antonia had no idea and she didn't care. \"Just leave it  alone,\" she ordered him. The last thing this school needed was  more rumors. She turned and left halfway through his next denial,  heading for the picnic tables and band practice, wishing for once  that she played the drums instead of the flute.</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>I don't really  hang out. I got to work after school. I go home from there and I'm  so tired I don't want to go out.

On the weekend, me and my other friends may hit the  basketball courts at the park or the movies. You know, normal stuff.</b></i></p>\r\n\

    <p><i><b>I love going to  the arcade and I'm always telling Kyle we should go. He doesn't  like it as much because it's where all the rich kids hang out, but  it's the only place with good pool tables.

    <p><i><b>I don't go out  much. If I hang out it's at someone's house that I know. I  don't let anyone come over to my place. It still freaks me out.  It's stupid, but it does.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>To hang out, I  would need friends. Don't really have any of those now do I?  Whatever. I wander around with my brother. We've hit most places  in town worth anything. Now they're all the same as anywhere else.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Friday wasn't as bad  as Antonia had thought it would be. There had been another update on  the news that had spent a long time telling them that Linda was still  missing. It had been a lot more straightforward than the  mini-biography that had aired on Wednesday night, and Antonia was  able to sit through all of it after dinner. Mom had asked her twice  if she wanted to change it, worried of course, but if she had wanted  it changed Antonia would have said so.<p>At school, news of  yesterday's fight had spread far and wide, but thankfully it was  mostly about Dean and his stint in juvie and no wonder with his  family. It was actually kind of fascinating since no one really knew  anything about him, and there were a zillion stories. It was Dean,  Sam, and their dad who wasn't around much. The leading theory was  that he was more likely a drunk than a killer since he was known to  stumble in at three in the morning and the police hadn't hauled him  off yet for questioning. They were dirt poor, and Dean was probably  dealing drugs since they had one sweet ride that they wouldn't be  able to keep otherwise. While Dean was doing time, so was his dad,  and his little brother had been through three foster homes and hated  his brother and his father now that he was back with them. Juvie was  where Dean learned how to fight, and the only reason he'd beaten up  Kyle. Couldn't stand anyone better than him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Of course, no one said  any of this to Dean's face. Or near his back because he also had  super hearing, according to one freshman. Better than a cat's.  The upper classmen were a little more realistic but no kinder about  it all. Rumors grew on trees after all.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"They wouldn't let  someone who'd been to juvie in here,\" scoffed Heather at lunch.  \"Even Rockford has standards.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He's just another  guy,\" Ari agreed, getting a couple of rolled eyes form Daniel.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"A guy who gets into  fights at the drop of a hat.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Kyle called his dad  a murderer,\" said Antonia softly. \"Wouldn't you get into a  fight over that?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Daniel shrugged.  \"Maybe,\" he didn't quite concede. \"Would depend on if my dad  did it.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Daniel!\" said both  Maggie and Heather at the same time. \"There's no proof!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"And the police don't  think he did it, otherwise we'd have heard about it by now,\"  added Ari.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How do you know?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"We just would.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Kristen and Kristina  don't seem to care,\" Antonia said before another argument broke  out. It seemed like all they did lately was argue about stuff.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What? Where?\"  demanded Maggie, craning her head around Daniel to see where Antonia  was pointing her chin. Dean had chosen a table to himself again,  this time without his little brother, and Kristen and Kristina had  both joined him. Everyone else in the cafeteria was either watching  or pretending not to, and both girls were eating up the attention of  being the bold ones willing to talk to the hot, dangerous new guy.  It was a good thing Brad had Second Lunch. Keith on the other hand  looked like he had just won a bet. Of course, he didn't have a  good enough angle to see how Kristina was falling for Dean's charm.</p>\r\n\
    <p>As riveting as this new  development was, it was boring to watch without sound so Antonia  found her eyes wandering. It was only when Bianca's caught hers  that she realized she'd been looking for her all day. Half-hidden  by a couple of her friends, Antonia had been half convinced that she  hadn't shown up at all. But there she was.</p>\r\n\
    <p>For once, Antonia  didn't flinch away, but nodded. When Bianca nodded back, Antonia  didn't know if it meant anything, but it felt like it did.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>Dating in high  school. Sometimes I wonder how or why people ever marry their high  school sweethearts. I mean, I feel like I grew up with half the  people I would potentially consider dating now. And let's be  honest, high school boys kinda suck sometimes. They think they know  everything about sex already when I can guarantee that there are more  virgin boys out there than girls. I just wish there were more to  choose from.</i><p><i>Well, there's a  lot of people to choose from. The question is do you want to date  them. There's a lot of pretty girls, but most of them are taken  already, the girls not taken tend to be, not bad, but different, you  know? Outside the mold, which is good, just sometimes they're a  lot of work.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>The Dating Scene is  vast and complex. You have, first of all, me and Jim. We're going  through an off period right now because he totally stood me up for  football before school started. He's still groveling. There's  Brad and Kristen and Keith and Kristina. Those four do everything  together and are totally doing it. Emily's dating Luke but she was  dating Larry after you two broke up. Melissa and Ferne are single.  So is Kelly, and I think Allison hooked up with Simon over the  summer, but Simon is like a revolving door. I don't see why people  keep falling for him. He's an okay kisser I guess, but he's  strictly a one night stand deal. Dave's like that too and there  was that whole thing with Dave and Pete both after Allison sophomore  year and she was so right to dump them both. Pete has this thing  going on with Ashley though I'm not sure if it's just friends or  friends with benefits because they don't really date, they're  just kind of joined at the hip. That's about it I think. You're  currently single, but I guess I don't need to tell you that.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Dating, man, I hate  dating. I mean, what the hell do girls want? I miss one date with  Hillary when she changed the time on me. She knew I had football  practice. It was training week. We aren't even supposed to go out  on training week and I got into huge trouble with Coach about it when  I got back from not even going on a date with her. And now she'll  barely talk to me and she says I have to show her I care about her  needs. What about my needs? If I didn't like sex I wouldn't  even bother.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>The thing I hate  about the dating scene is that there's so much drama. Half of the  guys I see girls crying over are so not worth it. I mean, Simon?  He's a great guy if he's not trying to get in your pants.  Otherwise, watch out, he's a scumbag. And I've told this to his  face. He likes his reputation, and that's a sign right there. A  lot of guys are like that. </i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I don't have that  much time to date. With the band, we're practicing every day. I  like girls, just none of them really get the band thing yet. I'm  not worried though. Once were get out no the road, there'll be  girls falling over themselves to sleep with us. I mean, you know,  one at a time. Not together. Unless there were two girls, that  would be all right. That would be pretty awesome.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>The last heat of summer  lingered into the evening after the football game. They lost.  Disappointing but hardly surprising. Antonia was just glad to  finally get out of her scratchy band uniform.<p>\"So you guys up for  Tony's tonight?\" Daniel bounced up to Antonia and Maggie as they  left the stadium. Ari was standing a little further away from the  gate talking with Simon, Pete, and Ashley.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I can't,\" said  Maggie. \"My mom wants me home right after the game.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You're kidding  me,\" said Daniel. \"Is it because of that freshman? Because  that's just stupid.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Maggie shrugged and  sighed. \"Yeah, well, I'm not in the mood to fight with her about  it,\" she said. \"I'd rather have a curfew than be grounded.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How is going home  right now different from grounding?\" Daniel demanded. Maggie just  shrugged again.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Sorry, guys.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What about you,  Antonia?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I can stay out till  ten.\" Antonia's mom hadn't been too thrilled about it either,  but she also said she expected them to say in a group in lit, public  places. Antonia had no problem with that. She wasn't going to put  herself in any more danger than she had to, but if Daniel was going  to be annoying about it, she might go home early anyway.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Maggie made her  goodbyes and Antonia and Daniel went and joined Ari. \"Is Heather  coming?\" she asked.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No,\" Daniel  sighed. \"Stupid girl. Why did she have to go and get herself  kidnapped?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It wasn't her  fault,\" said Antonia. Daniel was understandably irritated, walking  quickly and fast, but still.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Well, she shouldn't  have been wandering around where no one could find her,\" he  replied. \"If she had, someone would have seen her and she'd be  found by now.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>So Linda maybe should  have been more careful. \"But what if it was someone she knew?\"  challenged Antonia. \"Most kidnappings are done by people who know  the victim.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Then she should have  known better! Now she went and got kidnapped and everyone's  freaking out about it.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It wasn't her  fault!\" Antonia couldn't believe him. She stopped walking trying  to put together what she meant in her head. There was a whole other  person involved who had done the actual taking.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Fine, right, I  know,\" said Daniel. \"Sorry. I'm just . . . frustrated.\" He  gave her an apologetic smile that was anything but happy. \"You'd  think that someone from East River would know better than to walk  anywhere alone, is all. Then we wouldn't have to worry about  curfews and crap.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You have a curfew,  too?\" said Simon now that they were close enough to join their  little circle. Ashley and Pete stepped back a bit to let them in.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" said  Daniel. \"Fucking sucks.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Simon  agreed. \"Why did that girl have to get herself kidnapped anyway?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"She didn't,\"  Antonia snapped harshly enough to get everyone's attention.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"O-kay,\" said Simon  slowly and with a caution that immediately made Antonia feel like she  was overreacting.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Sorry,\" she added  hastily. \"Look. I don't know if I'm up for going out tonight.   I've had a pretty bad week.\" She didn't wait for Daniel to  protest. It wouldn't be much fun without Maggie there anyway.  \"I'll see you guys later.\"</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>I haven't had  time to get kissed yet. It seems like I'm always a step behind  everyone else with stuff like that. There's a guy at work though  who's pretty cute and we've talked a bit on our breaks. So  maybe?</b></i><p><i><b>My first kiss was  after my third track meet. Vanessa Joliet. I liked her back then.  A lot. An embarrassingly lot. Anyway, it was the end of the day and  we were watching the Varsity relay together. It was a close race.  Neck and neck the whole way, and every second on every change over  counted and it was still down to the anchor. I think it was Philip  Koan, who was a senior then and one of our co-captains. He was neck  and neck with the guy from Hollis High, he almost lost it on the  curve, but then he hit the straightaway and it was like magic. He  pulled in front and beat that other douche by half a pace. It was  awesome and we were going crazy on the side and Vanessa and I just  grabbed each other. I kissed her on the cheek first in all the  excitement \xE2\x80\x93 it startled us both \xE2\x80\x93 but then we were kissing for  real and it was amazing because we had just beaten Hollis by half a  pace.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>My first kiss was  with Brian Alldon. Fifth grade. Lips on lips, no tongue. We were  boyfriend/ girlfriend for about two weeks before he decided he liked  kissing Taylor better. In high school, my first kiss was also Brian.   For real, and it was good, and good practice. We didn't bother  with dating and just made out every once in a while. Then he decided  he was serious about Stacy and no more kissing partner for me.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>My first kiss was  with Ally Hooper. Two years older and smoking hot. It was at a  party I think. I think I was drunk, too. So good. She wore cherry  lip gloss and now whenever I kiss someone with that kind I think of  her.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>Let's skip this  question.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>First kiss?  Natalie something. We were somewhere in the South. It was summer.  She was staying at the same motel we were. In the pool everyday. I  would go out and watch because she was gorgeous. I don't really  remember how we got to the kissing. I think it was boredom and the  only other kid around was Sam who was eight and annoying. That was a  good motel.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Antonia figured that  the best way to stop obsessing about everything that was going on was  to focus on the documentary. She didn't want to look at the  footage yet though. She'd done enough of that already to have a  feel for it and right now she didn't want to think about all the  different perspectives and histories that were winding their way  together. Instead, she headed for the public library to see what  they had for video editing programs since there was no way their home  computer had the ability to do the professional job she wanted.<p>The library was one of  those places in town that had everybody pass through at one point or  another. Some became fixtures like Ashley and Pete and their friends  who preferred to meet in one of the study rooms to do homework  instead of at one of their houses. Antonia spent a good chunk of  sophomore year in the microfilm room for her history project on the  early years of the Civil Rights Movement, so she knew her way around  that area and the computer area next to it where she had actually  typed the paper. As she walked in, she went to the computer she had  used then, a fond little smile curving around her lips.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The room was mostly  empty as she settled in. On the other side of the computers where  the big work table was, she could hear someone rustling around,  probably the same person using the on but empty microfilm station.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia had done a  little poking around on the internet to look for what kind of  programs she needed. She was using the new digital camera that she'd  saved all summer for in preparation for this documentary, but the  question was would the library have the programs she needed. It took  her a little while to find that they had something video editing  related, and even longer to figure out that it wasn't what she  needed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Time to ask the  librarian what to do. Antonia stretched as she got up, straightening  the curve out of her back and shoulders. It was still pretty quiet  in her little corner of the library. Standing she could see the back  of the guy hunched over the table that was covered in microfilm  printouts. Idly curious, Antonia glanced at the microfilm screen as  she passed. It was unsurprisingly a newspaper, but the headline made  her stop.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Murdered Child Found  in River\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia stared for a  second then leaned closer to look at the date in the corner. 1984.  Footsteps startled her back a step, an excuse barely formed fleeing  as soon as she saw who it was. Dean's brother, Sam. He looked up  from the notebook in his hands when she did and the two of them were  like deer caught in each other's headlights.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hi.\" Antonia  waved awkwardly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam's eyes were  darker than Dean's and they seemed to watch her twice as carefully.   \"Hi.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia meant to turn  and continue on to the reference desk, but somehow she found herself  waving her hands toward the headline. \"Murdered children?\"  Because what the hell.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam glanced at the  screen, too, and if it weren't for the fact that Antonia was more  than a little bit confused and wondering if this was what Dean  thought leaving it alone meant, she would have been a little more  conscious of the fact that it was none of her business.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Missing children.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam looked back at her.   \"They were missing for weeks before they showed up dead. The ones  that were found.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia frowned. \"They  weren't all found?\" That couldn't be. How could they not find  them? Realistically, she knew that happened, that people went  missing for fifty years before their corpses showed up in the wall of  a building that was being torn down. Helplessly, she looked back at  the school photo of the girl that had been found in the river  thirteen years ago. They were supposed to at least find the  children.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Three,\" said Sam.  With a sudden need to know, Antonia sidestepped him and strode to the  table in the back. She took him by surprise but he still jumped  after her. \"No, wait!\" he said, but the table wasn't that far  away. On it were laid out ten stacks of printouts and newspaper  articles in chronological order from left to right.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Anna Lineus, 1962,  Laura Folke, 1967, Phillip Ousler, 1974, Katherine Buchanon, 1976,  Lindsey Kohl, 1979, Perry Grossman, 1982, Julia Andale, 1984, Alicia  Scott, 1988. Bianca Harrison, 1993. Linda Karlyle, 1997.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What is this?\" she  whispered, fingers landing on Bianca's stack covering the picture  of her father's smiling face. \"Why are you doing this?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam huffed, put out by  her inconveniencing him, no doubt. Well, too bad. These were  people's lives stacked up here. \"I was just curious,\" he  whined.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Bullshit,\" said  Antonia. She could feel the anger burning hot in her belly. First  Dean had been asking questions, now this? Had Kyle been right?</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam's lips pursed as  he tried to out stare her, but he wouldn't win this contest. It  took a good minute for him to realize it before he finally shoved  past her and started pulling everything together. He was going to  leave, Antonia realized when he snatched his bag off the floor.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No.\" Antonia  grabbed his arm hard enough to feel his muscles shift under his skin.   \"You think they're connected.\" She was sure that he was going  to pull away, but he didn't. He nodded. \"How?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"If I knew, would I  be looking?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How?\" she  repeated.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"They're all the  kids that have gone missing in the last seventy years,\" Sam  shrugged. \"That's a lot for a town this size. Especially so  close together, done by different people?\" He shrugged again.  \"You're the one who lives here. You tell me what's going on.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia stared at him  again and didn't know if he expected an answer or not. There  stared at each other as the silence got longer and longer.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Do you know anything  about when Bianca went missing?\" Sam finally asked quietly. He  slipped his arm out from under her hand and sat down, pushing a chair  out for Antonia. When she couldn't answer, the silence dragging  on, he said, \"She was the only one ever found alive. It doesn't  say by whom \xE2\x80\x93 anonymous tip. Her dad got there first and surprised  the guy or something, the article's not too clear, but he died.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>She remembered Bianca's  muffled sobbing and the sound of her choking on her own spit. It was  dark and it stank, but the phone worked. Antonia had no idea how  long they had sat there, but she remembered the look on Bianca's  face when her dad came in. \"There was no guy,\" she said, half to  herself, because there hadn't been. There had been blood and the  fire poker, and there <i>hadn't</i> been anyone else.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What do you mean?\"  asked Sam.</p>\r\n\
    <p>But Antonia shook her  head. She didn't want to talk about it. Or think about it. Or  have it brought up again. Blinking, it was like seeing Sam again for  the first time, and this wasn't why she had come to the library in  the first place. She had come to get away from this, not relive it  with Dean's little brother staring at her like a puppy.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Forget it,\" she  said, standing, turning, and hurrying back to her computer. Sam  followed a step and a half behind her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia, wait.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No!\" She spun  around to face him. \"There was no one else there. It was just  Bianca and, and her dad, and . . . it was just them. Now leave it  alone.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam kept his mouth  shut. Antonia, the rush of blood loud in her ears, turned and fled.</p>\r\n\

    <i>My parents are  divorced. That happened when I was ten. My mom's remarried and my  dad's still single. My stepdad's great, we all get along just  fine. I still ignore them as much as possible. You know how it is.  My mother tends to worry too much and always wants to know where I'm  going, who I'm going with, when I'll be home. I think she thinks  that I'm going to go buy drugs the first time she forgets to pester  me. If I wanted to do drugs her pestering me would be what drives me  to it.</i><p><i>My parents are okay.   Dad's in business for himself so he works a lot, but he's always  been there when I needed him. Lately they've been on my case about  college, telling me I need to think of life after running.

    <p><i>I love my parents.  My mom is pretty cool. Going shopping with her is one of my favorite  things because it's like going with my friends. Sometimes my  friends come with us, but I like it when it's just the two of us.  She's like another friend, you know? Which I didn't expect at all  when I was in middle school and didn't want anything to do with my  mom because it was so uncool to have her hanging around. It felt  like she was around all the time, but it was because she came to all  my soccer games and all the football games just to see me cheer, and  a lot of people's parents don't go to that effort.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I actually don't  talk to them much because I'm so busy and they're pretty busy  too. It's easier to get along with them when they're not in my  business. Dad's gone on business trips a lot, and my mom goes with  him about half the time, which is great for having parties. They  trust me though and they don't mind.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>It's just me and  my mom but it's good. She has to work a lot \xE2\x80\x93 she's a lawyer \xE2\x80\x93  so I try to help out around the house.

Half the popcorn ends up on the floor when we throw it  at the people doing stupid things, but it's just the two of us.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>My parents are crazy  and they don't let me do anything. They're always telling me to  do this or that or do better in school, and my dad hates the band.  He thinks it's a waste of time and that I'm going to end up on a  street corner with a tin cup for tips. I just want him to look at me  and see that I can do this. Screw school, I'm terrible at it and  it's no use trying to do better because it's not going to make a  difference. My dad doesn't get that.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Antonia was exhausted  when Monday rolled around. Nightmares she'd thought long gone had  returned and with them the heavy weight of guilt and the longing for  it to just be over. But late Sunday night, trying to talk herself  out of turning on the light, part of Antonia thought, it'll never  be over. Not really.<p>She tried to be normal  at school although she felt anything but, and did a fairly passable  impression that fooled her teachers. Maggie knew something was up,  nothing much got past her, but she did Antonia the courtesy of not  asking and acting as a buffer from the world during English. But it  wasn't English she was worried about.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean surprised her  though. He wandered into calculus and instead of asking a thousand  inappropriate questions, he threw her two glances that were for once  serious, the same kind of look he'd given his brother with thirty  bucks for groceries. But he didn't say anything. Unsettled,  Antonia wondered what he was playing at. Sam had to have told him,  he'd be acting like an asshole as usual otherwise, but now he  wasn't doing anything about it. She couldn't decide if she was  relieved or not. It felt like he was waiting to pounce.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't give  him a chance, avoiding him through Study Hall by sitting with  Allison, and hurrying to meet her friends at lunch. Dean didn't  seem bothered by it, in fact, he barely gave her a glance when  Kristen snagged his arm and invited him to eat with her, Kristina,  Keith, Kelly, and Simon. He hesitated before shrugging in  acceptance, sitting like he belonged there.</p>\r\n\
    <p>From across the room,  she couldn't hear what they said, but she couldn't stop watching.   Wondering how they could sit there and laugh and joke as if nothing  were wrong. As if there weren't a student missing. Ten in forty  years. None in the thirty before that. Antonia had no idea about  statistics and town sizes, but she'd never heard of the other  children, never even cared about that stupid ghost story that was a  little girl bruised and battered in a closet. Lost and afraid and  not knowing when it was going to end.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia!\" Maggie  touched her arm, making her jump.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Movies this  weekend,\" said Maggie. \"If I ask early and we go before dark the  parents shouldn't care.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, of course.\"  Movies. Antonia concentrated on her sandwich trying to get back to  the now.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Great!\" said  Daniel. \"Make sure you ask today.\" Antonia nodded absently, her  eyes already drifting back to Dean, wondering why he was interested  in the missing kids and when would he get it over with and ask her  already, whatever it was.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You stare any longer  and everyone's going to think you have a crush on him,\" Heather  startled Antonia by saying.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dean Winchester?\"  Heather nodded in his direction. \"What's with you today? I  thought you didn't like him.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I don't,\"  Antonia confirmed. She didn't. She didn't know why Dean kept  stealing her attention or why she even cared what he did in his free  time or how much money he had or how he got it. She shouldn't. He  was your typical guy, thinking about nothing but sex and food and  getting into fights. And he might also be the only other person at  this school that cared that Linda was missing. \"I don't,\" she  repeated when Heather didn't say anything.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Kristen does,\"  piped up Maggie. \"Emily saw her push him into the First Floor  Corner before school today.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Really?\" That  bitch. That was a mess waiting to happen. The First Floor Corner  was the start of a hallway that never got finished. It went for six  feet then stopped making it the prime make out spot on school  grounds. \"Does Brad know?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Maggie did a face  shrug, and Daniel said, \"He's gonna kill him.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Brad didn't kill  Dean. He didn't even start the fight. He did get in Dean's face  and warn him to stay away from his girl. Dean had smirked and  challenged Brad to keep her. \"Oh my God, I'm not a horse,\"  Kristen had giggled from the sidelines, delighted that they were  arguing over her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Later, Antonia heard  from Hillary that Dean had grinned and said, \"No, but I bet you  like to ride,\" loud enough to scandalize everybody and their  mothers.</p>\r\n\
    <p>That was what prompted  Kyle and Wilson to start heckling and calling him a fag. Shouting  how he liked to \"take it like a bitch,\" and that's when the  fight started. This time, in the broad corridor between A wing and  the cafeteria, the teachers did see it. Antonia hadn't been there,  but she'd bet it was Dean who threw the first punch.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was so stupid, she  thought as she listened to Hillary and Emily. \"It took four  teachers to get them apart. It was like, five to one, and Dean still  put Kyle and Hanson on the floor. If I hadn't heard what they  called him, I would think he was psychotic.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Do you think the  juvie rumors are true? Was he really in?\" asked Emily.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I don't know. Why  are you asking me?\" said Antonia, glancing at Maggie puzzled.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You've actually  had conversations with him,\" said Hillary with a flick of her  eyebrows that very succinctly conveyed \"duh!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So have Kristen and  Kristina.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Who are totally  flirting. Dean likes you, you know,\" said Hillary. \"I heard he  was asking about what you were like when you were younger.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, right.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He was!\" she  insisted. \"Are you ever going to interview him?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No,\" said Antonia  sharply. Although she wanted to. God knew why, but the kernel of  needing him to explain everything once and for all was right there.  Then she'd know and he wouldn't be this mystery walking around  like he owned the place. There'd be context and history and maybe  he wouldn't be so frustrating to deal with.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You should. Weren't  you the one talking about making sure every voice is heard?\" said  Hillary with a sly smile. \"Maybe you can ask him who he's going  to Homecoming with.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Why? Still  interested?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hell no!\" Hillary  shook her head with a disgusted little pout. \"He might be hot, but  he's still probably a murderer or something. Drug dealer at least,  and I am not going to get mixed up in that.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Now you see why I  don't want to do an interview with him,\" said Antonia, hoping  that would be enough to get her to drop the idea, but Hillary just  rolled her eyes.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So get Daniel to  help you or something. You should still do it. Dig into his tragic  past. Find all his skeletons.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>This time Antonia  thought Hillary was the one being overly dramatic. \"Yeah, I'll  get right on that.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Great!\" Hillary  beamed. \"Now's your perfect opportunity.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia turned to look  over her shoulder. Sure enough, Dean was walking quickly to his  locker, a red patch of skin already purpling on his jaw. It was late  enough after school that he must have just been released from Mr.  Holms's office.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm not asking  him,\" hissed Antonia as they watched him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Coward.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia glared at  Hillary who simply raised a brow in a dare. She couldn't back down  from that, but fortunately, as soon as she started moving across the  hall, Dean shot her a look that just as clearly said that now was not  a good time. His gaze lingered a moment longer than it should have  before he hurried off toward the parking lot. Antonia didn't  bother going back to the others. Hillary and Emily could go screw  themselves for all she cared and Maggie was already catching up.  They got out front in time to see Dean get into an old style black  car with a gruff older man that must have been his father. He didn't  look very happy if the look he shot Dean was anything to go by, and  Antonia flashed back to Sam's fear after the last fight, wondering  whether the bruise on his chin would be the only one still there in  the morning.</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>Don't get me  wrong, I like school and I like Rockford. I just don't have time  to do the extra, \"Yay, school!\" routine. So I guess I'm all  for school spirit, I just don't really do it myself. I'm lucky  if I make a football game all year.</b></i><p><i><b>Okay, there's  school spirit and then there's school spirit. There's what the  Mr. Holms thinks is spirit and all the football hype which is so  overrated, and then there's all the other sports that get no  attention but we all still love our sports and representing our  school. So yeah, I have spirit. It's just not the normal spirit.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>School spirit is  a funny thing because it's something that seems like it's for all  the popular kids, and me and my friends are always making fun of them  because they are giving in to the party line and being sheep. But  you know, I always kind of want to participate in Spirit Week anyway,  even though it feels like copping out, because it looks fun and I'm  really proud of my school even when I hate it.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I have school  spirit and I like it because it feels like when we play we have  people behind us and we're playing for more than just the game or  winning, but for pride. When it's not football season, I try to  give that back by showing up to basketball games and I have a bunch  of friends on the track team and one ex-girlfriend, Mandy is on the  soccer team, and so I used to go to those games, too. Spirit works  both ways.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I've never  really thought a lot about school spirit. Ninth grade I didn't  notice a lot of things and afterward, I just couldn't. I went to  my first football game junior year and it was okay. It was the first  time I felt normal, even if it was only for a little while.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I don't bother  with school spirit. We never stay in one place long enough and it's  just not worth it. Most schools are the same anyway. There's not  much to distinguish them except the little things like the mascot,  but for the most part? I can't remember much difference from one  place to the next.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Dean wasn't at school  the next day. It quickly became apparent that the story of him  skipping town on the run from the police was unfounded when none of  the other boys in the fight were at school either. They were all  suspended, as per the punishments listed in the Student Handbook for  fighting. So it was a little surprising when Dean showed up after  school in Antonia's way by the picnic tables as she was making her  way to band practice.<p>\"Dean!\" She  startled, taking a quick step back to keep her balance. \"What are  you doing here?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Picking up Sam,\"  he shrugged. His eyes, however, had the same intensity they'd had  yesterday, like they knew far more than Antonia wanted them to. \"I  also wanted to talk to you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh, yeah?\"  Antonia crossed her arms across her chest and hoped she didn't  sound as nervous as she felt. Linda hadn't been found, the  nightmares hadn't gone away, and Sam's list of missing children  felt like it was constantly getting longer.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Dean said.  He didn't have a bag or anything with him. \"You were there when  they found Bianca.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Even though she'd  been expecting this since Saturday, the words still came as a  surprise. \"You don't know that,\" she replied, fingers  clenching on her arms. She'd been kept out of the newspapers, the  press had never talked to her, and if Bianca had told, Antonia would  have heard of it by now.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You're in the  official record,\" said Dean, taking a step closer to her, his voice  softening.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"And how did you get  that?\" she snapped. He had no right to pry into this. It was none  of his business. No one was supposed to know, just the police and  Bianca and her mom. \"Forget it. I don't want to know.\" She  shook her head sharply, breaking the grip of anxiety. She had band  practice to get to, but Dean stepped into her way again. \"Move.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What happened?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Nothing. Move.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Bianca was beaten  up. Her father ended up dead,\" Dean stepped closer, but Antonia  held her ground. \"Her statement said someone else was there.  Yours doesn't.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"There <i>wasn't</i>  anyone else there!\" she snapped, pushing him out of her way, two  hands to his chest. He was big enough that he could have stopped  her, but he didn't, instead he fell back a step, finally letting  her by.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Fuck off!\" She  stormed past him, her hands clenched tight against the shaking, she  was so mad. But the little voice in the back of her head whispered  that it wasn't anger at all.</p>\r\n\

    <i>Homecoming is really  an excuse for having a dance early on in the year. No one ever comes  back for the homecoming part, and the game is something but not  everything \xE2\x80\x93 we don't have a reputation to worry about \xE2\x80\x93 so  it's all about the dance, which is the fun part anyway.</i><p><i>Okay, Homecoming is  such a bunch of hype. The girls go crazy about the dance and it's  the preview for Prom and it's all they talk about. Yeah, okay the  dance is fun, but does it have to be the only thing that gets talked  about for two weeks?</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I love Homecoming.  It's the first dance of the year and it's way less stress than  Prom. Parties are fun and all but there's always drinking and the  music sucks half the time. Homecoming's more like getting back to  basics and everyone's there so you get to see people who don't  normally go to parties. It's just good fun and I love the dancing  because there's real slow dancing. I'm excited about this year.  We don't do the king and queen stuff till Prom so there's no  pressure or anything at Homecoming.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Homecoming is so  vanilla. I go because my girlfriend wants to go and I'm not going  to be the one loser who doesn't show up. The football game isn't  usually any bigger than any of the others so it really is all about  the dance. For me it's just getting through the school part to get  to the real party afterwards. I'm already planning it. Better  music, plenty of kegs, it's gonna be real, if you know what I mean.   None of this chaperoned shit.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>It's fun, it's a  dance. I go because my friends go and it's fun to dress up a bit.  Me and my friends go as a mass, all with each other which makes it  unlike Prom where someone's feelings always get hurt.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Screw Homecoming. I  went freshman year and got swirlied by a couple juniors in the  bathroom. It's just another place where the popular kids can show  off how wonderful they are and how they hate everyone else.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>He was still there when  band practice let out, sitting on the picnic table with his elbows on  his knees like he had all the time in the world. As soon as his eyes  fastened on Antonia, she felt the good mood left by the music leave  her.<p>\"Antonia?\" said  Maggie cautiously, eyeing Dean.</p>\r\n\
    <p>He wasn't going to  give up, Antonia realized with a growing dismay. Why did he care?  Why was part of her grateful that he did? \"I told you to fuck  off,\" she said when he got up to meet them.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean glanced at Maggie.   \"Two minutes, or I'll follow you home.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'll call the  police,\" she retorted. Dean made a face, not liking that idea at  all.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Two minutes,\" he  repeated, believing her at least when she said she'd do it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm not going to  tell you anything.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Then I'll talk.\"   He was frustrated now and trying to hide it. When she started past  him with Maggie as a buffer zone, he added, \"I'll pay you. I'll  even do one of your stupid interviews, just two minutes.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The offer of an  interview was tempting enough to make Antonia look back. He was  serious. After all the mocking and being a pain in her ass, he'd  do it. \"Two minutes of you talking,\" she clarified, the offer  making her feel a little bit more in control. \"For an interview.  And you're not an ass through it.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia wanted to say  yes, but she was afraid of what he would say. Nevertheless, an  interview she didn't have to stoop to get was maybe worth it.  Should she, shouldn't she, should she, shouldn't she. \"Okay,\"  she said before she thought about it too much. He couldn't let it  go, but then neither could she.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Maggie went to the  parking lot with a worried glance for Antonia, leaving the two of  them at the picnic tables. Antonia checked her watch, already  regretting it, and Dean got straight to the point. \"Someone else  was there when you found Bianca,\" he said. \"Bianca saw him and  told the police about him, but you didn't because you were scared.  You thought you were going crazy.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia looked past him  at the arts building and tried not to think about that night.  Interview. She was getting an interview out of this.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Did he flicker?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Her attention jerked  back to him at the question. How did he . . . Antonia felt her eyes  widen but was unable to help it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'll take that as  a yes,\" said Dean, still perfectly serious. \"You're not  crazy.\" But she was already shaking her head. \"He was there.  He was real.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No.\" The word  slipped past her lips by accident. It was impossible. People didn't  just flicker. She knew this. She <i>knew</i> it. Bianca had been  out of her head with pain. She'd been tied up and gagged when  Antonia found her, only wearing a torn, men's sized undershirt.  Her skin had been clammy and mottled like a calico cat, and when she  was cut free all she did was hold on to Antonia and cry. She'd  been out of her mind with pain and didn't know what she was doing  or later, what she saw.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia,\" Dean  took a step forward and she took a step away. \"Okay, okay,\" he  stopped, his hands going up spread wide and open. Antonia spun  around; an interview with the mystery boy wasn't worth this.  \"Wait, Antonia,\" Dean called after her. \"I still have a  minute.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Leave me alone,\"  she shouted back, hating the threadiness of her voice. Her hands  were shaking and she couldn't make them stop. Dean didn't give  up, however, following a few steps behind.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Look, forget the  guy, he wasn't there, whatever you want to believe,\" he said  quickly as if that was supposed to make everything better. \"How  did you find her?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Bianca. How did you  find her?\" Dean repeated when she stopped and half-turned, brought  up short by the question. \"She was missing for two weeks. The  police looked everywhere, and you found her in the middle of bumfuck  suburbia.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I . . .\" She  didn't know how to answer that. She didn't know how to think  about it, so she never did. Antonia glanced at her watch. \"Your  two minutes are up,\" she said instead. \"I'll talk to you  tomorrow about the interview.\" She summoned up the last of her  composure to flash a false and probably pathetic smile that was more  a baring of teeth.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She was such an idiot.  And Dean Winchester was a bastard.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You're not crazy!\"  he called after her, but Antonia ignored him. He didn't know  anything.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i><b>Like I said, I  don't get to games because I have to work. It's okay as a sport  but I barely know the rules and the only reason to go is because  that's where all my friends are hanging out.</b></i><p><i><b>I like football,  even if it's overrated. I played a little in middle school. Well,  I mostly sat on the bench in middle school, but it's a fun game. I  go to as many games as I can. I get a little crap for it, going and  actually watching the games. All the track guys just hang out and  talk shit about the game and how little sense it makes, and my other  friends think it's me trying to be better than all them because I  like it. It's like I'm sucking up or something. It used to  really bother me and I wouldn't really watch like everyone else,  but this year I've decided that I don't care what they think. Or  you know, care less.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I don't really  feel one way or the other about football. The football guys are kind  of jerks really and the team sucks and this whole country is obsessed  with football and I wish it weren't. It just seems like a huge  waste of time and effort.

    <p><i><b>Football is the  only reason I go to school. It's the only thing that makes all the  other shit worth putting up with. Let's be honest. I barely pass  the school stuff. Football's the only reason I haven't dropped  out yet.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I've already  kind of answered this one. I haven't spent a lot of time noticing  football or any of the other things you're supposed to care about  in high school. You know what it was like. I just wanted everything  gone and to be the way it was before my parents started the divorce.  That's when everything changed and I had no idea . . . How could I  care about football?</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I think we both  know what I think of the football team. Sports in general are all  good I suppose. I've never played on a school team. My brother's  the one with the jones for organized sports. Me, not so much. None  of it's real anyway. None of it will count for anything when it  matters.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Even if Dean was full  of shit, it didn't stop Antonia from thinking about what he'd  said. The crazy part of her brain that insisted she'd seen  something that night kept whispering no matter how Antonia tried to  silence it, tossing and turning all night and still bothered by it  when she went to school Wednesday morning.<p>Dean was still  suspended, but Antonia saw Sam who, for the first time that she could  remember, smiled at her. It was a weird and unsettling and she just  knew that Dean had told him about their non-conversation yesterday.  It felt like having a layer of herself peeled back for the world to  see everything private underneath. The only saving grace was that  they clearly hadn't told anybody else since the chatter around  school was more focused on who had asked whom to the Homecoming dance  that was in a week.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was early this year,  almost too early for new relationships. It was an asking frenzy  since summer break-ups hadn't all been patched up yet, even Antonia  got a few queries from boys she barely knew. Dave also asked her,  but that was almost a tradition now so she could laugh in his face.  He took it with good grace, grinning as she went through the motions  of outlining why she would not ever go out on a date with him. It  was fun and by the time he said, \"Okay, okay, already,\" like he  had back in tenth grade, they were all laughing.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So we're all going  together, right?\" said Heather after Dave went back to his table  across the cafeteria.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Jason in band  already asked me,\" said Maggie with a blush.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Jason?\" Antonia  smelled fresh news, feeling light and free for the first time in  days. \"From the drumline? That Jason?\" He was kinda hot.  Antonia had Spanish with him last year, and of course, knew him a  little through band, but she hadn't expected this.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Maggie's blush got  darker. \"Yes. He asked after practice while we were packing up.  Nothing really special about it.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Do you like him?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You totally like  him,\" Heather and Antonia grinned at each other. \"That's  great,\" Heather went on. \"Then me and Ari can go together and  Antonia and Daniel can go together.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia nodded and  shared a knowing smile with Daniel. Maggie wasn't the only one who  totally liked someone. Today was Maggie's day to get teased,  however, if only to spare Ari for a little while longer. Maggie  cursed them all to hell and back, but enjoyed every minute of it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia was still  chuckling when she went to throw her trash away, but her good mood  evaporated when she saw Bianca waiting for her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" said Bianca.   \"You got a minute?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Mutely, Antonia nodded.   Bianca looked terrible. Her hair was in a ponytail today, loose and  greasy, and her face looked like she hadn't slept in a week. She  knew what this was about, and for once she didn't feel like running  away. Her nightmares of Bianca trapped in that closet were too  fresh, the grief and pain of that night pricking on the underside of  Antonia's skin, too close to ignore.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dean came by my  apartment last night.\" Bianca looked down at her hands. Her  polish was chipping and her nails were bitten down. \"He said he  talked to you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He cornered me after  band practice,\" Antonia felt the need to clarify.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Bianca nodded with a  wry smile that suggested Dean had done something similar to her. \"He  said you saw . . . saw him.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't move,  frozen, because she didn't know what she saw. Bianca was watching  her and it was too much so she glanced away, toward her friends who  were still laughing back at their table. A world away. \"I . . .\"  she started, but didn't know how to finish it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Two years of  therapy,\" said Bianca, \"and I was finally convinced it was  displacement or projecting from the post traumatic stress. And now  you saw him, too.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I don't know what  I saw.\" It wasn't quite a lie. After Bianca . . . after  Bianca's dad got hit, <i>he</i> had appeared out of nowhere,  enraged and snarling. Terrifying for that split second, then he was  gone, dispersing like smoke. Antonia was so sure she had made him  up. Still was. Maybe. With everything that had happened  afterwards, how could it have been anything other than something her  mind had made up to cope?</p>\r\n\
    <p>Yet when she met  Bianca's eyes now two years and another missing girl later, they  both knew that she did know. Bianca broke away first this time,  brushing a strand of hair behind her ear, something she'd always  done when she was uncomfortable. \"Dean also asked how you found  me,\" she said. \"I opened my mouth because it seemed obvious, but  I realized I didn't know. No one ever told me.\" She laughed  self deprecatingly. \"I was so messed up I never even thought to  ask.\" Her eyes held the question she didn't voice, another  question Antonia didn't have an answer for but for different  reasons.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I have no idea.  Really,\" she added when Bianca's stare turned doubtful. She  couldn't explain it, and it was her turn to laugh helplessly. \"You  were my best friend and you were missing. Two weeks and the police  were ready to call off the search so I just got on my bike and found  you because no one else would. I don't know how or why . . . I  just found you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Whether Bianca believed  her or not, Antonia couldn't tell, surprised instead when Bianca  sniffed and blinked away tears. \"Did I ever thank you?\" she  asked in a small voice that hid the hurt of their broken friendship.  That part, Antonia remembered, when everything fell apart, crumbling  under guilt and anger and shame. They were just two girls who didn't  understand how the world had changed on them so quickly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia felt her eyes  prick and hoped that no one could see the pair they made in the  corner of the lunchroom surrounded by garage cans. \"You never had  to,\" she told Bianca.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Thanks anyway.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>In her mind's eye,  Antonia saw Sam's stacks of missing children, all but one dead.  \"You're welcome.\"</p>\r\n\

    <i>So there's, like,  three types of friendship. Your real friends who you hang out with  outside of school. The friends that you only really talk to in  school because they're in class with you and your real close  friends aren't. And the people who you're friendly with but you  don't really know them beyond their name. It's not that  complicated until one of your acquaintances thinks that you are their  real friend just because you smiled one too many times in the hall at  them. Then it's all hurt feelings and trying to make nice and then  your real friends get mad at you because of the hanger-on and it's  very stressful and unpleasant all around.</i><p><i>I've got a bunch  of different groups of friends. The guys I used to be tight with  I've kinda drifted away from since I got involved in track. The  track guys are some of my best buddies. They're a hilarious bunch  and we spend so much time together it's like family. I love my  other friends though. You and Maggie and Heather and Ari. You guys  are just, comfortable, you know?</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I feel like such a  social butterfly sometimes. I know just about everyone and they all  know me. My closest friend is Emily though. We've known each  other forever and I don't think there's anything that could  separate us, you know? Well . . . anyway. She's my best friend  because I know I can go to her with anything and she'll make it  right somehow.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Friends are the  people who stand with you. I'll never forget this one time in  tenth grade after a game we lost to Dunhare, a couple of the guys on  the other team were harassing us when we were going back to the bus  and one of them threw a full soda can at us that busted and sprayed  everywhere but mostly over me. I was so pissed, I was ready to break  his head open so I went after him. He ran even though he probably  could have taken me back then. I turned around and three of my  friends were standing with me. That was pretty cool.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I love my friends.  I think they're the only reason I haven't tried to graduate early  and get out of here faster. I'd miss them too much. I know we're  all going to college next year and everything will change and be  different. I guess that's the one thing I'm not looking forward  to changing.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Oh man. Friendship,  huh? Friends are everything. My parents sure as hell don't get  me. All my teachers at school think I'm wasting my life or hate  me. Everyone else makes fun of me, but not Tory and Ben. They're  just like me.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>The first Antonia heard  of the raid was overhearing Jim and Larry talking in English about  how Wilson said it was just like the movies, guns blazing and  everything.<p>\"What was?\" she  turned in her seat to ask them, curious.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"The SWAT team,\"  said Jim with a grin. \"I don't know what happened, but they had  a house surrounded in Wilson's neighborhood last night. He said it  was really cool.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Did they find her?\"  Antonia felt her heart skip a beat with sudden hope.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Who?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Linda!\" She  wanted to smack him that he even had to ask. Did no one remember  that there was a girl who had been kidnapped still missing?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh right. I don't  think so,\" Jim shrugged. \"They'll find her soon. I mean  they're obviously working on it.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia wanted to  scream at his casual acceptance that everything would be all right in  the end. It had almost been two weeks since Linda had gone missing.  Two weeks. How could no one understand how long that was?</p>\r\n\
    <p>She tried not to think  about it, but her brain was stuck on repeat of Bianca's cold,  clammy skin and the echo of her cries.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia.\" The  sudden touch on her arm made her jump, but it was only Maggie  standing beside her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"The bell rang,\"  said Maggie with a frown. \"Are you okay?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm fine,\"  Antonia snapped because she was. She had no reason not to be. She  never had and this whole thing was stupid and ridiculous and she  hated that she'd just zoned out of English like that. It was  stupid because they had a test next week on these readings and if she  failed she was screwed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Despite her  determination to get her head on straight, the day didn't get  better, and by the end she was even more out of sorts than she had  been that morning. She jumped nearly another foot when Sam appeared  beside her at her locker after school.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" he said,  shifting awkwardly while she tried to slow the beating of her heart.  He wasn't as tall as Dean and hadn't started to fill out, but the  long lanky lines of his arms and legs suggested he was going to be  tall.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What do you want?\"  she asked testily.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dean wants to know  if you can do the interview tomorrow,\" said Sam.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, maybe, why? I  would have thought he'd put it off as long as possible.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam stared at her as if  he couldn't tell if she was being stupid on purpose or not. \"He  wants to talk to you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He does,\" Antonia  repeated with just enough of a disdainful question in her voice to  make Sam huff in annoyance.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"We need to know how  you found Bianca. You can tell me if you don't want to talk to  him.\" He crossed his arms across his chest, his eyes widening just  enough to make him look ten years old.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I don't know how I  found her,\" she snapped, hating that he expected her to just  answer, but hating even more that she didn't know. She didn't  know, she didn't know, she just <i>had</i>. How was she supposed  to do something she didn't know how to do? What did they expect  form her. It was too weird and frightening and, \"Why do you even  think you'll do a better job than the police? Why do you even  care?\" she demanded, pulling her bookbag over her shoulder and  slamming her locker shut with a satisfying bang. No one else cared.  No one even noticed anymore. It was all about the movies and TV and  hey, you want to go to Homecoming with me?</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam was staring at her,  his jaw clenching slightly like he was angry and for a second Antonia  saw the same thing in his eyes that had been in Dean's when he'd  faced down the football team. \"Why shouldn't I?\" he finally  responded. \"Because she's just another kid from the wrong side  of the river?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>That wasn't what she  meant at all, and it hurt the way he said it because Antonia cared  too but was helpless about it. She was the only one it seemed like  and it wasn't fair of him to accuse her of blowing Linda off. \"I  didn't mean . . .\" She didn't know what she meant either  except that what was in the past was in the past and she didn't see  how dragging it all back into the light was going to help. Bianca  had been her best friend since first grade. She didn't even<i>  know </i>Linda.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Whatever.\" Sam's  eyes flickered away from her to the doors and back. \"You gonna do  the documentary thing tomorrow with Dean or what?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes, fine. Tell  him, I'll meet him after school,\" she said. It was just a stupid  interview.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sam didn't bother  saying goodbye; he just left. Antonia stared after him blankly,  wishing there was something in all this that wasn't slipping  through her fingers.</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>Oh man. Yeah, I  feel pressure. I help keep my family afloat with my job at the  grocery store. I gotta do well in school so I can get a job that  actually pays something after I graduate. Sometimes I feel like  everyone's counting on me, my mom, my brother and no one says  thanks or even notices. I work my ass off and all people do is ask  for more. I mean, what am I supposed to do? Shouldn't I get to do  something for me every once in a while?</b></i><p><i><b>From my mom, she  expects me to do my best no matter what. She doesn't take any crap  from me at all. I got an F once on my report card in English. I  told her I couldn't do any better, the teacher hated me, which she  did, and my mom just looked at me and said \"you will do better.\"  It was so embarrassing, but she called up Mr. Jones the same day and  then made me go to tutoring sessions with one of the seniors. I  hated it and was a jerk about it until Coach found out, then he  wouldn't let me practice until my grade in English improved. It  was like everyone was out to get me, but I sucked it up because I  couldn't not run. I tried it for a week and it was miserable. I  passed English the next grading period. Taught me to never say \"I  can't\" to my mom.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I feel like if  I'm smart I can't ever not do well or everyone will think I'm a  faker. All my friends expect me to go off and do great things and  they're always saying things like, \"you're going to forget all  about us if you ever go to college.\" And I can't ever not know  stuff, so I say I do even when I should ask, because I'm the smart  one. Even though my parents don't really care if I'm smart or  not, I still feel like I have to prove to them over and over that I  can do it and make it outside of Rockford.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I don't feel a  lot of pressure. I'm doing pretty well. I'd like to do well in  the Lincoln game cause that's where the scouts are. I think I  could make it as a football player. My brother says I have to work  hard at it, and he always wants an update on me whenever he writes or  calls. It's like having a third parent sometimes and not even our  parents are as bad as he is.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>There's a lot  of different types of expectations. Sometimes I think people just  expect me to go off on them, and when they treat me like that I want  to. My mom's been real good about it for a while though.  Sometimes I think she's the only one who sees me. My friends are  okay but I haven't let them in. It's hard for me now, but they  don't pressure me about it, which I guess is why they're my  friends. I don't know. Sometimes I wish people would expect more  of me.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>Yeah, there's  pressure. My dad expects me to take care of my brother when he's  gone. Always has, but it's nothing I can't handle. Frustrating  at times, but Sam's a pretty good kid, when he doesn't have it in  his head that we're trying to ruin his life anyway.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Antonia didn't get a  chance to talk to Dean in Calculus, but he caught up with her on the  way to Study Hall. \"We still on for this afternoon?\" he asked.<p>Antonia put a little  more distance between them. \"Yes. In the conference room in the  office,\" she said, not looking at him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Okay.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"And we're just  doing the interview,\" she said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean didn't say  anything, and Antonia didn't dare look at him, but the weight of  his judgment was there between them anyway. \"What?\" she snapped,  finally glaring at him. He was watching her again with the intensity  of someone who saw right through her. It was downright uncomfortable  but she didn't flinch away, as much as she wanted to.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Just wondering where  the girl who chewed out my ass on my very first day went to,\" he  said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\" She  stopped walking, thrown.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You calling me a  bully for picking on my brother? Any of this ringing a bell?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>It felt like a lifetime  ago, a different person, although it had only been two weeks of  stress between then and now. \"So what?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So help me find  Linda,\" said Dean.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How the hell am I  supposed to do that?\" Antonia demanded, baffled and frustrated that  he didn't see that there was nothing she could do. \"I don't  even know the girl!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You found Bianca.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What the hell has  that got to do with anything?!\" It was one thing to talk to Bianca  about it, she was there. It was quite another for Dean to be  demanding this of her. He didn't know the first thing about what  it was like to be scared out of your mind for two weeks of not  knowing. He didn't know what it was like to find your best friend  brutalized. He didn't know what it was like to call for help and  have something other than help arrive.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Everything!\" Dean  almost shouted it. The hall was getting emptier, and they were going  to be late to Study Hal, and Antonia did not need a detention on top  of everything else.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That is such  bullshit,\" she said, turning and hurrying on to the lounge. She  didn't want to have this conversation. Bianca's case had nothing  to do with Linda's.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean easily kept pace  with her with his longer legs. Antonia just wanted him away from  her. \"Look, I get that you're scared,\" he said. \"There's  things going on here that you don't understand, but I can explain.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"There's nothing  for you to explain.\" It was just another excuse. \"I said I'd  do the interview. I'll see you after school.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You can help her,  Antonia,\" Dean persisted. \"It's all connected and someone's  going to kill Linda if you don't help us find her.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I can't!\" She  spun on him as they reached the lounge, frustrated by her own  powerlessness as much as by his determination to make her feel guilty  for not being able to just wave a magic wand and find missing people.   Dean put his hand on the door before she could open it and escape  into the crowd beyond.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You can,\" he  insisted, his voice dropping to something calm and certain that had  no place in a teenager. \"You just have to try.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>He pulled the door open  then, seconds before the bell rang.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>I don't feel like  I have more privileges or responsibilities now that I'm a senior.  My parents certainly don't trust me more. They're pretty good  but they still want to know everything about what I do. It's not  that they don't trust me, just that they don't leave me alone  about it.</i><p><i>I have more  responsibility this year on the track team as co-captain. It's  something I take very seriously because we have a lot of freshman  that need to be brought up to speed and also we look out for them off  the track, too. I'm treasurer of the Key Club and one of the  leaders this year and that's a lot of responsibility because we're  in charge of the direction of the club and making sure all our  members keep up with the time commitments. It's a hard job because  a lot of the guys are friends and we're walking that line between  ordering people around and pissing people off. It's a good  experience though, and I'm glad I'm doing it. And I'm not just  saying that. </i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I feel a great deal  of responsibility towards my fellow students as a member of the  Senate. I want to make sure that I hold their best interests at  heart at all times and sometimes that's hard. I sometimes feel  torn between my commitments like student government and doing the  research I need to in order to make good decisions, Big Brothers and  Sisters, cheerleading, because we have practice every day. There's  a lot going on and balancing all that, staying on top of it is, like,  you know, juggling. I manage okay. Better than some people. </i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I've always been  responsible. It's never been a problem. My parents trust me,  Coach trusts me on the field, my friends know I'll have their back  when they need it. I don't know about privilege. I'm not  anything special and I have to work as hard as the next guy. </i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I think of myself as  a responsible person but I wouldn't say growing older has caused me  to have more responsibility other than the usual moving up in groups  I'm involved in. My mom and I have worked out what were each  responsible for between us and the major change there was when I got  my driver's license in tenth grade. I feel more responsible for my  own future now than I did then, and that's what makes me want to do  well in school, get into a good college and move forward in life.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I'm responsible  for the band since it's in my garage. I keep everyone organized,  make sure people have their music. I told my dad that but all he  talks about is how that's playing and that I have no sense of real  responsibility. Which is bogus because it is real responsibility. I  don't need a real job. Music's where I'm going and there's a  lot of responsibility there, too. With, with, you know, fans and  stuff and telling the truth that people want to hear.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>However much she wanted  to discount what Dean had said, Antonia couldn't shake it. She  never thought of herself as someone who would back down and hide from  difficult choices. As a kid, she'd loved the sassy heroines who  always talked back and sacrificed everything because it was the right  thing to do, only no one ever told her that it was so hard in real  life. It wasn't till ninth grade that she understood what silence  meant.<p>She spoke up for Sam  because he wouldn't speak up for himself. Even if he hadn't  needed to in the end, it wasn't something Antonia could let lie.  She wanted to help Linda, too, but it wasn't the same thing at all.   It was too big for her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Sitting on her corner  of the couch in Study Hall, she stared at her Spanish book, not  taking in the reading. Across the room, Dean sat at a table with a  notebook out, the first time she had seen him do any kind of work  this year. How could he be so confident? How could he be so sure  that this would end the way it was supposed to and Linda would be  alive and no one else would be dead?</p>\r\n\
    <p>Bianca's father had  been shocked when he walked in.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia snapped her  book shut, the memory burning through her. She wasn't going to  think about it, she wasn't going to think about it. She wasn't  going to think about it. The sound of her book slamming closed had  everyone looking at her, the weight of their stares too heavy for her  to return at so she closed her eyes. If she was honest with herself,  here in the dark and quiet of her own mind, Antonia was scared.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You okay?\"  Allison's voice was hesitant and quiet, but still enough to make  Antonia flinch.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" she lied,  when all she wanted was to scream \"No, no, no!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Somehow she got through  the rest of the day, fighting memory and faking happiness like  nothing was wrong. It had worked before, after all, and by the time  the final bell rang she had almost convinced herself that everything  was fine. She'd interview Dean and it would be done with. She was  strong enough to withstand his questions and whatever he had to say.</p>\r\n\
    <p>He was waiting for her  at her locker, watching her approach with the same steady gaze he'd  pinned her with that morning. Antonia pretended that it didn't  bother her, that it didn't feel like he was peeling a layer of skin  aside and seeing all her secrets. But she was stronger than the need  to run away from him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You ready?\" he  asked when she'd gotten her books together.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"We're doing the  interview and only the interview,\" she told him as she set up the  camera in the conference room. Dean dropped his bookbag on a chair  and slouched in the seat beside it. He thankfully didn't say  anything but it didn't seem to matter. Antonia could feel what  wasn't said in the silence between them. She wasn't going to say  anything, she wasn't, she repeated like mantra in her head, only it  sounded ridiculous because, she realized, adjusting the camera height  so Dean was set up off center, because she was tired of being afraid.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The last time she'd  been in here, Bianca had sat in the same chair and they'd had their  longest conversation in over two years. It may have been scripted,  but they'd had it, and if Bianca, who had more reason to flip out  about things than Antonia did, could sit face to face with her, then  maybe Antonia could stop being scared for long enough to figure out  what was going on.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She didn't turn the  camera on. Dean frowned a bit, puzzled when instead of pulling out  her list of questions she took a deep breath and said, \"Okay. How  are they all connected?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean actually looked  surprised by the question and his eyes flickered to the camera before  settling on her face. It made Antonia feel better, like she was in  control for the moment, and not jumping off a cliff into the unknown.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It's complicated  and a little weird,\" said Dean, but he pulled at the zipper of his  bookbag and took out his notebook. There were loose papers in it,  articles that Antonia recognized from Sam's stacks in the library.  He slid a couple photographs over to her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>They were black and  white photocopies of newspaper articles, both from 1962, both  featuring Anna Lineus. In the first picture, Anna was smiling for  the school camera. She was about fourteen or fifteen, blond, with a  sixties haircut. The second picture was a police sketch of a man  with dark hair and dark eyes. Antonia's breath caught when she saw  it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Is it him?\" asked  Dean quietly. He didn't need to clarify; Antonia nodded. It was  the man she had convinced herself wasn't real. \"His name's  Todd Murphy,\" said Dean. \"He's the man who kidnapped and  killed Anna. He turned up dead in the river five years later.\"  Too stunned to ask, Antonia blinked and just stared at him. \"You  saw his ghost,\" Dean went on, calmly, making Antonia blink again,  because what . . . \"We think he's the reason so many kids have  gone missing.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>It took a moment for  Antonia to find her voice; all she could do was stare at the face  that had haunted her nightmares. \"That's impossible.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean didn't  contradict her, he just kept talking. He told her about the missing  children, the ones found anyway, how the beating that finally killed  them all tended toward the same pattern as the one that killed Anna.  \"They were all hurt before though,\" he added quietly. \"By  different people. One of the boys had a file with social services  and a court order removing him from his father.\" He didn't say  what for, but he didn't need to. \"Ghosts are creatures of  habit,\" he went on. \"They repeat what they did in life. This  guy takes kids with bad families. Hurts them the same way he hurt  Anna, then leaves them to die slowly and throws them in the river.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean stopped, his voice  cracking a bit, and for the first time, Antonia looked and saw how  much this was bothering him. He wouldn't meet her eyes, kept his  own on the photo, but his hand was in a fist on the tabletop.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't know  if any of this was real. It was too fantastical, too weird, and if  she hadn't seen Anna's flickering murderer, if Bianca hadn't,  if, if, if . . . the look on Dean's face, angry and a little bit  broken would have made her believe.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"But we can't  figure how where he takes them. The ones not found in the river,  there's no pattern.\" He looked up at her with the reason they  needed to know how she found Bianca in the air between them. Antonia  still didn't know how she had, but something else was clicking into  place in the back of her head.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She'd called 911 with  the phone in the hall, and then she'd called Bianca's dad because  he had a cell phone and she couldn't remember her mom's number.  He'd told her, \"I'm on my way. Don't call anyone else.\"  He'd gotten there before the police had.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I don't \xE2\x80\x93\" her  voice cracked so she swallowed. \"I don't think the ghost hid  them.\" When she risked a look at Dean he wasn't even frowning  like she thought he would, but waiting, listening. Traitorous  thoughts Antonia had shoved away in the wake of the funeral and the  publicity of Mr. Harrison's tragic rescue of his daughter finally  bubbled free. \"With Bianca, I think her dad did.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean didn't move,  didn't say anything, and it was like permission to finally speak,  Antonia thought hysterically, because Dean wasn't from here. He  didn't know all about what a philanthropist Mr. Harrison was. He  didn't know about the gifts to the school, the way he smiled to the  newspaper after he won a case in court, putting someone away. Even  when he and Bianca's mom were getting divorced for undisclosed  reasons, everyone felt sorry for him that his work was driving a  wedge between him and his wife. He didn't know how Antonia thought  Bianca's mom was weird for taking long naps during the day and  wearing sunglasses inside, smelling like alcohol, or how relieved she  had felt when she'd heard him calling her name in that abandoned  house when he arrived so quickly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I called him after I  called 911,\" she said, the words flowing out of her like water.  \"He told me he'd be right there and not to call anyone else but  he hung up before I could tell him I already had. Bianca was in bad  shape. She was only wearing a t-shirt and I was so scared I could  barely think about what to do. When he came in, he tried to take her  from me, but she wouldn't let me go. I remember being so confused,  and then she hit him, barely because she was so weak. He hit her  back and knocked her out of my arms. She was screaming and I don't  know what I thought, except maybe he was trying to get her to calm  down, like when someone's hysterical you slap them. That's when  that other man appeared. The ghost.\" The word sounded strange and  stilted on her tongue, but now that she had a name for it, it also  felt right. \"It happened so fast. There was a fireplace and  Bianca grabbed the poker. Her dad was trying to pull her up and the  other guy, the ghost, was right behind him. She just swung.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't know  if that was right, but she remembered the poker and the blood and the  wrangled scream that she didn't know if it came from Bianca's  dad, Bianca, or her own throat. Maybe none of them. Maybe all of  them. She remembered Bianca crying afterwards, going to her dad and  collapsing onto him, \"Daddy, no! Wake up, I didn't mean it!\"  sobbing until the sirens sounded down the street.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Everyone just  assumed that her kidnapper had killed him,\" she whispered. \"We  never talked about it.\" She laughed suddenly, hollow and worn out.   \"I don't even know what I told the police.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You said someone hit  Mr. Harrison but you couldn't see who.\" Dean's voice cut  through the silence, loud despite its softness. \"You said you  didn't think anyone else was there. With Bianca's statement, the  police thought you just didn't see her kidnapper.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He wasn't there.\"   The words she'd repeated so many times finally felt false.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He was there,\"  said Dean. \"But he was after Bianca, too.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia finally looked  at him. He didn't think she was crazy or stupid or wrong, and just  that acceptance was like a weight lifting that she hadn't realized  she was carrying.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How did you find  her?\" he asked, and this time Antonia didn't flinch from the  question.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She sighed. \"I went  looking. I didn't have a plan, I just had to find her. And I  did.\" She shrugged helplessly. \"I can't explain it.\" She  wished she could because Linda was out there now, still missing.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The argument she  expected from Dean didn't come. Instead he nodded, \"Okay.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How did you know it  was a ghost?\" she asked suddenly. \"And how did you even think up  ghost as an answer, and why? Why are you doing this?\" Because  Dean was the type of guy who was the last she'd think would care  about anything like missing children.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean gave a  self-conscious shrug. \"We thought it was just Anna, the Crying  Girl, but then we looked into it.\" He shrugged again. \"Then  Linda went missing, and the news broadcast with her parents was  suspicious.\" He didn't say anything about how they knew about  ghosts and for once Antonia didn't want to push it. She wasn't  sure if she even believed it really, except nothing else made sense.  She was exhausted, and she wanted to go home and let him fix this.  She looked at her camera, silent and waiting, then back at Dean who  was as mysterious as ever, but maybe not the complete jerk he was  before they walked in here.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Are you free next  week to do the interview?\" she asked, after a minute.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" he said.  \"Anytime.\"</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>I don't have  time to date. It takes too much energy to do it properly. But there  are a lot of cute boys at school, I'll give us that. Whether any  of them are dateable? Well, none of them are interested in me. I  feel like such a black sheep sometimes because it's always one of  my friends, Felicia or Bianca, who gets all the attention. Never me.</b></i><p><i><b>The dating scene  at Rockford is complicated. I can date girls from East River, maybe  some from the track team. Me and Vanessa dated for about a year,  till she said I was too boring and dumped me half way through  sophomore year. I've hooked up with people since then, but not  really dated dated. I had this huge crush on Emily for most of  junior year, but could never ask her out. Such a shame. She's  seriously hot.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I've had two  boyfriends. I'm currently with Darren who very conveniently lives  in the same building as I do. We've known each other for most of  our lives but we never even thought of dating until last year when we  were partners in Computer Science. We stuck together in that class  since we didn't really know anyone else well. Everyone else sat  with each other. Even when we switched partners, Darren and I would  usually end up together. It ended up working out just fine for us.  He's really cute, isn't he? And so sweet. This summer he kept  getting me flowers at the most random times. I have no idea how I  got such a good guy.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>There are some  fine looking girls here. Really hot. There's also some pretty  ugly ones. And those girls in the band? So not worth the effort.  If you want to really get to know someone, if you know what I mean,  you have to know how to ask and who. I've gotten laughed at a  couple of times for assuming in public, but back behind the locker  rooms? Well, I won't name names since she was waiting for someone  else and I don't want him to kill me, but she certainly lived up to  her reputation.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I don't date.  Part of it's me. I don't want anyone that close to me. But  mostly it's what everyone thinks. \"Damaged goods.\" People  pretend I don't know what they say about me.

    <p><i><b>Well, I know  Kristen likes me. Pretty sure a couple of those other cheerleaders  were whispering about me last week. Things got a little strange  after the fight. As far as I can tell about how actual dating people  goes, I'm pretty much scandalous material. One girl I talked to  said not even if I didn't live in East River. What kind of  bullshit is that?</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>If she weren't in the  band, Antonia would have skipped going to the football game. As it  was, she sat quietly in her section and for once let her mind wander  without a censor. Bianca had been a mess freshman year. It had  started after the divorce had, when her mom had moved out to East  River and she and her sister started going back and forth in the  temporary custody agreement. Antonia hadn't understood it then.  She hadn't understood it afterwards either. Hadn't wanted to.  Who would? she wondered, looking around her at the crowd of students,  her classmates, everyone. She knew some of their stories, tidbits  from their lives that they were willing to share on tape, but how  many other secrets weren't getting told. How many people were like  her or Bianca or Linda?<p>The football team  pulled off a win, and Antonia thought of what Jim had said about  playing for his teammates and not letting them down. Later when she  and Maggie met up with Daniel and Ari and Heather, she thought about  the track team and how they looked out for each other in school, how  Maggie fended off Hillary, how she found Bianca. How Sam Winchester  looked at her when she'd asked why he cared.</p>\r\n\
    <p>They went out to the  movies and Tony's afterwards for floats. The curfews of last week  had been lifted; no one was really worried about their kids getting  kidnapped as the search died down. The police had their suspect and  that was the end of it as far as most people were concerned. Antonia  felt guilty but she wanted the questions from her friends less about  why she was staying home, so she went with them, going through the  motions, relieved when it was time to go home and call it a night.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So how did the  interview with Dean go?\" Maggie finally asked as they were walking  to her car. She glanced back at Daniel and Ari to make sure they  didn't overhear. \"Is he a jerk on the inside, too?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" said  Antonia for lack of anything she actually wanted to say. It was  still too raw for her to talk about. She almost wanted to tell  Maggie everything, but she couldn't do that without sounding like a  crazy person. Which was why she had never said anything before.  Still the words didn't come.</p>\r\n\
    <p>They drove home in  silence down the main road that paralleled the river, splitting their  town in two. Antonia stared out into the darkness and the shadows of  warehouses and piers giving way to the residential areas and finally  the cemetery on the old marsh where a fire reflected off the water.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>Oh, that's not  fair. You can't ask college essay questions. A challenge that  I've overcome? Fine, let's see. Passing physics last year. I  learned that there are truly things that I do not understand but that  if I memorize how to do the problem I can get by with a C. How's  that for a life lesson. Faking it works!</i><p><i>Personally, my most  challenging moments have been on the track. Pushing myself further  than I think I can go. I've learned the hard way that my body  really does have limits but that perseverance still counts for a lot.   There's knowing that in your head and knowing it because you've  done it. That's a big difference.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I've faced a lot  of challenges in high school. I can't think of any right now, I  know that's lame, but you know how it is. As soon as we're done,  I'll think of, like, twenty, but right now I'm blanking. But  they are all things that I'm sure I learned from, and came out the  other side a better, stronger person in the end.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Challenging is  figuring out why your girlfriend is mad at you. I remember once  Hillary stopped talking to me for a week and I had no idea why. She  wouldn't tell me. Her friends wouldn't tell me, just gave me the  evil eye or cursed me or whatever the hell girls do to make your life  hell when they're mad. Took me two weeks, some serious  eavesdropping, and fifty bucks to pay spies before I found out what  it was. I told Larry that I was excited about going to a Garth  Brooks concert and Hillary didn't know about it. I had just gotten  the tickets that day! Of course I hadn't told her about it yet. I  hadn't seen her. She finally forgave me when I bought her a  ticket, too. She doesn't even like Country.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I did a summer  program to France where we stayed with host families for six weeks.  That was probably the most challenging thing I've ever done. We  had to speak French all the time, and school really doesn't prepare  you for how fast people talk and how hard it is to keep up. It was  great though. We did little touring trips every other week. By the  end I was getting along okay, I could follow the conversations even  if I sucked at participating in them. That wins hands down.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Learn the guitar. I  taught myself. Bet you didn't know that. My uncle who I don't  see very much got me a guitar when I was in seventh grade. Dad  thought it was a waste of time, but I thought it was cool. I didn't  really do anything with it for a while, but then I guess I started  messing around and then I went to the music store, just to check it  out. One of the guys there, Nathan, was really cool about me being a  complete idiot and when I told him my dad wouldn't let me take  lessons he offered to coach me through teaching myself. It was  really hard at first, and I gave up about ten times, but Nathan kept  calling with music books to suggest so I ended up learning. It was  the best thing I ever did.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Dean Winchester and his  brother were the last people Antonia expected to see on her doorstop  on Saturday morning. Her mother gave Antonia a look that promised  conversations and lectures on just who she was hanging out with when  she left them in the foyer. Antonia couldn't blame her. Dean and  Sam were filthy. Their normally shabby look was compounded by dirt  ground into the knees of their jeans and fingernails and bags under  their eyes. On top of it, they smelled like smoke, the kind that  suggested arson instead of cigarettes.<p>\"We can't find  her,\" Dean said without preamble.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Are you crazy!\"  Antonia demanded feeling underdressed in her hastily dragged on jeans  and t-shirt. \"You can't just show up here like this!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia! Would you  shut up and listen? The ghost is gone, the cops have the wrong guy,  her dad is lying low, and Linda is running out of time before she  dies of dehydration.\" Dean hissed, keeping his voice down so her  mom wouldn't hear. \"We can't find her. And we think you can.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Look, I told you, I  don't know how I found \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"We don't think it  matters,\" Dean interrupted with a glance at Sam who today looked  more like a moody teenager for once. \"We called . . . some people,  and they think you found her because you wanted to.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia stared at him,  not believing she was hearing this. \"Are you telling me I'm  psychic?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Maybe?\" Dean was  once again as serious as a judge, but this time Antonia wasn't  buying. It was one thing for him to spout off about ghosts and maybe  be right about them, but her having special powers was ridiculous.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was Saturday, bright  and sunny, and yesterday felt more like a dream than reality.  Antonia stepped back in the house and closed the door on Dean and the  pounding that followed. It was crazy. She was crazy.</p>\r\n\
    <p>But. She stopped,  leaning back against the door and feeling the vibrations shiver  through her. Could it hurt to try? Could she find Linda by wanting  it badly enough? Could she live with herself if she didn't?  Without stopping to think about it too closely, she opened the door  again. Dean and Sam were already walking back to their black monster  of a car. \"Give me ten minutes!\" she shouted, startling them  both.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was crazy, she was  crazy, but she couldn't not try. She had found Bianca, and  somewhere between telling Dean everything and him showing up here  asking for help, Antonia had started to believe that maybe she could  find Linda too.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She ran out the door  with a box of Nutrigrain bars and a less than satisfactory  explanation for her mother. She was so grounded when she got back,  but for once, Antonia didn't care in the least about that. Dean's  car looked ancient but well cared for with a bench seat in front that  they all three crammed into, Antonia between the boys. Her heart was  still pounding from the run from her house, the engine thrumming in  counterpoint when Dean turned her over.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Now what?\" she  asked looking at Dean, but it was Sam that answered.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Now think about  finding Linda,\" he said as if that was all there were to it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I don't even know  Linda,\" Antonia retorted. \"How am I supposed to find her if I  don't know her?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How did you find  Bianca?\" asked Dean. Up close he was even grubbier and more  exhausted than he'd looked on her front steps, and Antonia realized  that they'd probably been out looking all night.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I didn't exactly  think about,\" she replied more softly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So don't think  about it,\" said Sam.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia tried but soon  discovered it was impossible. \"It's not working,\" she said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You have to do  something!\" Dean all but shouted.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I don't know how!\"  Antonia shouted back, the calm of not thinking about jumping in the  car with the Winchester brothers rapidly dissolving. It had been a  stupid idea. What could she possibly do, anyway. She was just a  girl and they had no right to put Linda's life on her. It wasn't  fair, damnit, and she refused to feel guilty about it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The silence in the car  quickly became oppressive and they were all determinedly <i>not</i>  looking at each other. Antonia was about three seconds from telling  Dean to drive her home, fighting off the hot flush of tears that had  started prickling behind her eyes.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Can I have one?\"  Startled, Antonia glanced at Sam who had a tentative finger on the  Nutrigrain box.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Knock yourself out,\"  she said. Sam did, taking four bars and passing two to Dean who  ripped them open with his teeth and ate them in about five bites.  She wondered when the last time they had a meal was. The car coasted  to a stop at the stop sign and even though the intersection was  empty, Dean didn't move them forward.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Where to?\" he  asked. Both he and Sam looked at her expectantly, and Antonia  resisted the urge to snap, \"I don't know!\" one more time like a  broken record. She said, \"left,\" instead.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I picked it at  random,\" she told them a bit spitefully as they made the turn.  Dean shrugged in response, and Sam started listing off everything he  knew about Linda. Hair color, eyes, what she did in class, where she  sat, everything her parents had said on the interviews on the news.  At each intersection, Dean waited for Antonia to give him a  direction. It was stupid and pointless and didn't feel like  anything other than random chance so it was a surprise to Antonia as  much as to them when she said \"Stop!\"</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>My mom is  amazing. She works two jobs to take care of me and my brother. It's  hard for her but she does the best she can and she keeps my brother  in line.

He would come take me to  the zoo in Lincoln or take me fishing on the river, stuff like that  when I was little.

    <p><i><b>My parents are  good folks, but they always want to know what's up with me. I  can't get away from it sometimes.

    <hr>\r\n\
    <p>They were at an old  strip mall, seven or eight shops and a grocery store long abandoned,  whose signs had been torn down, leaving only reverse sunburn patches.   Butcher paper covered some windows, cardboard boxes were stacked  haphazardly within others. The three of them stared at the long  stretch as Dean pulled into the parking lot.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No cars,\" said Sam  softly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Could be around  back,\" Dean replied but he didn't sound too worried about it.  \"Which building?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"The travel agency.\"   Antonia pointed to where World Travels was imprinted on the  building. She didn't know how she knew. She just did, like she  knew multiplication tables or that the Earth was round. There was  nothing strange or earth shattering about it, no weird tug or  headache or anything but the certainty that that's where Linda was.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was terrifying.  \"Hey, hey, hey.\" Dean's hand on her shoulder startled her, and  Antonia couldn't breathe, there was air all around and she couldn't  breathe, couldn't breathe, couldn't . . . Dean pushed her head  down and said something else she couldn't hear because of the blood  rushing through her ears. There was rustling and a moment later a  bag smelling like stale French fries and ketchup was being shoved in  her face, held over her nose and mouth. Slowly, Antonia came back to  herself. The bag smelled disgusting, but she didn't remove it yet,  safe in the dimness, staring at the floor of the car.</p>\r\n\
    <p>What was she?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia.\" Dean's  voice was pitched low. \"We're gonna go check it out. You stay  here, okay?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>She nodded even as Sam  said, \"I thought we were supposed to call Dad,\" over the metallic  creak of the door opening.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Gotta have something  to tell him,\" Dean replied then the doors slammed shut. Antonia  kept her head down through the sound of the trunk opening and closing  and the crunch of graveled asphalt. The silence helped clear her  head, focus on the hope that they had found Linda. She laughed a  little hysterically, sitting up in time to see Sam disappear into the  building after Dean, thinking she'd never cared so much about  someone she didn't know before. But everyone was important to  someone, and if they weren't they should be.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was going to be all  right.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't know  how long she sat there in Dean's car. It felt like forever \xE2\x80\x93 how  long did it take to search a building anyway? \xE2\x80\x93 and it was starting  to get hot. The sun prickled her skin where it shone through the  glass, baking the interior along with her nerves. She should go help  them, but part of her was afraid of what she might find. It was  probably dark and she'd never been one for horror movies and this  one had freakin' ghosts. Asking if it could be worse than her  nightmares was only tempting fate, nevertheless, Antonia felt useless  and lame, the damsel in distress while the men did all the rescuing.  It didn't bother her, really it didn't. She didn't need to be  there. She wouldn't make a difference.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She wished they would  hurry up, though.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She tried singing to  keep her mind off it, but her voice had never been made for singing  and the light wobble only made it worse. Besides, she could only  think of \"Go team!\" songs from band which were so wrong, sitting  in the parking lot of an abandoned strip mall in East River where the  only cars around were square cornered and falling apart like the one  pulling in, made when boxy was in style.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia watched the car  for three whole seconds before it registered. It was only a few  hundred feet away and kept coming, eating up the empty space of the  lot between them, and it could only have one destination. She  glanced at the door, but Dean and Sam didn't magically show up.  They didn't even have a phone. The police didn't know they were  here. The car was almost there, and she could see the driver, a man  but he was too far away to recognize, especially with the glare of  the sun on the windshield. Antonia couldn't sit any longer. Dean  and Sam were totally unprepared, and if Linda was there she'd need  help.</p>\r\n\
    <p>But the car surprised  her by parking in front of the Laundromat two shops down. Antonia  stared at it, confused, as the man got out. He was tall, taller than  he looked on TV, and he had a key to the door that he used to let  himself in.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Frantically, Antonia  scrambled for the door handle, half tumbling out onto the pavement  and to the door to World Travels, cursing Dean for parking a row  away. \"Dean!\" she yelled as soon as she got to the entrance.  \"Dean! He's here!\" Boxes and a broken desk were in her way as  she tried to get to the only other exit in the back, but she barreled  past them, barely noticing when a corner caught her shirt, ripping  it. \"Dean!\" The back room turned out to be a back hallway,  stretching to either side, the length of the connected buildings.  Antonia froze, terrified that Linda's dad had heard her. Where  were they?</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was a warren of old  stock rooms with doors that wouldn't open and half collapsed walls.   Antonia quit thinking about it and just let herself move as fast as  she could. Nearby, footsteps sounded on the cement floor, heavy and  loud. Somewhere ahead of her she could hear the sound of banging and  Dean shouting Linda's name. The footsteps around the corner  stopped. Antonia's heart was in her throat. Dean and Sam had no  idea he was coming. They might be two against one, but Linda's dad  was twice Dean's size and Sam was just a kid. She knew better than  anyone what one stray blow to the head could do \xE2\x80\x93 to the skull, to  the brain, to the walls. Swallowing hard, Antonia pushed the memory  back. The footsteps were already jogging away towards Dean and his  brother.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dean! He's here!\"  she yelled at the top of her lungs. The silence that followed was  deafening. For two heartbeats then everything seemed to converge in  her direction. Antonia ran.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She didn't know where  she was going except away. Right, right, left, right again. Away  from Linda, away from the pounding beat of feet behind her that kept  getting louder and louder until she couldn't tell what was him and  what was her. She didn't dare look back. Curses slid past her  like oil, barely noticed as she ran and tried not to kill herself on  the sharp corners and broken boards.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You little bitch!\"  she heard Linda's dad yell as his hand snagged in her hair.  Antonia jerked free with a scream, knowing it was only a matter of  seconds before he caught her for real and she wouldn't be able to  get away.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia, drop!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Instinct took over and  she dropped. A gun went off and overhead she felt sprinkles, heard a  scream, and Bianca's dad was falling, falling, falling, blood  everywhere, except \xE2\x80\x93 \"Dean!\" Sam yelled \xE2\x80\x93 there was a large  strong hand on her leg and Antonia was in the hallway again, Linda's  dad too close behind her so she kicked and thrashed because she  wasn't going down without a fight.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The grip broke under  her frantic feet and Antonia scrambled up and away. Dean was running  toward her, a shotgun against his shoulder, aimed at Linda's father  who was groaning in pain, a splatter pattern of blood staining his  shirt.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Sam!\" shouted  Dean, stepping in front of Antonia as soon as she was past him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I found her!\"  Sam's voice floated back from . . . somewhere. Antonia slumped  against the wall, trying to catch her breath and keep her heart from  running on without her. She was shaking all over form adrenaline and  fear and she couldn't stop, her own panting harsh and loud in her  ears. Dean had a gun, she thought wildly, a thousand stories of him  doing time suddenly seeming a lot less theoretical. Antonia had  never been more grateful.</p>\r\n\

I always know where I stand with her.</i><p><i>I'm thankful for  my car. Before I got my car getting around was a nightmare, and I  think I fought more with my dad when I was sixteen than I did in all  the other years combined. So Dad getting me my own car both made my  life livable and kept the two of us from killing each other.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I am most thankful  for all the blessings in my life. My family, that we're all safe  and happy and healthy. That we don't have to worry about anything  big. I thankful that I'm a good student and that I decided early  on to get involved with school because that will help out with  college applications. I'm thankful for my friends and that we care  about each other as much as we do. I could keep going, do you want  me to?</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>Football. It's  the only reason I even try in school anymore because otherwise I'd  be benched. Everything else could change or die but as long as I can  play, the rest of it doesn't matter.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I'm thankful for  my mom. She's awesome. Sometimes annoying and she loves to  embarrass me, but she's still the best person in my life.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I'm most thankful  for Ben. He's my best friend and I don't know how I'd survive  without him. Sometimes we just sit and talk for hours and it really  helps because it reminds me that there's more out in the world than  what my dad thinks there is. Ben believes I can make it which makes  me believe I can make it. I think we will someday. We will and then  all these suckers at Rockford will wish they never screwed around  with us.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>Antonia wanted to stay  with Linda until the police arrived, but Dean had a very valid point  when he demanded, \"Do you want to explain this?\" gesturing at  Linda's dad lying tied up in the hallway, unconscious after Dean  had knocked him out with the but of his gun. Sam had gone for the  first aid kit that was in the car and Antonia watched as they  carefully wrapped Linda's battered body in a blanket, covering the  scrapes and bruises. Her hair was tangled and greasy, her lips were  dry and cracked, and her eyes that had peered open briefly were  bruised and shadowed. She didn't look anything like her pictures.<p>\"It's all right  now,\" Dean murmured the whole time he knelt beside her. \"Help's  coming and you're safe. It's gonna be all right.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>They stayed until the  sirens screamed in the distance \xE2\x80\x93 God only knew where Sam had found  a phone \xE2\x80\x93 then Dean handed Sam his shotgun and picked up Linda,  carrying her outside. They had chalk in the trunk too for some  reason \xE2\x80\x93 Antonia had given up being surprised \xE2\x80\x93 that Sam used to  leave a note on the sidewalk, an arrow pointing in with \"lair\"  written underneath.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Help's here,\"  Dean told Linda who was more unconscious than not when he laid her on  the sidewalk in the sun. \"You're safe.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The three of them  scrambled for the car and were on the road just as the ambulance came  around the corner. \"We should have stayed,\" said Antonia, a  kernel of guilt forming in her stomach for running. \"They'll  need to know what happened. What if they just let her dad go?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"There's plenty of  circumstantial evidence,\" said Sam quietly. He was staring out the  window. \"We should call Dad.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"We will,\" said  Dean looking across Antonia at Sam with concern. They'd brought  Linda out before Antonia could see the room where they'd found her.   She was grateful for it; she'd seen the inside of that kind of  Hell once before. \"We'll call when we stop.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Stop?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Apparently the first  thing you did after finding a kidnapped girl and running from the  cops was go eat. Antonia wanted to protest, but Dean was already  pulling in to McDonalds and the thought of food made her stomach  rumble, reminding her that the guys had eaten her breakfast.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Walking in was a  surreal experience. She half expected the police or someone to show  up and drag them off for questioning, but everything was normal.  They ordered Quarter Pounders and fries, several each for the guys  and sat in a back booth where the sun was streaming in the window,  warm and reassuring on Antonia's skin. Linda was going to the  hospital. They were less than fifteen minutes away and already it  felt like a dream. Or a nightmare. The phantom tingling on her  scalp reminded her that it could have turned out very differently.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So you guys brought  guns,\" she said. Both Dean and Sam stopped mid chew and stared at  her before sharing a look. Dean shrugged and resumed stuffing his  face.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Seemed kinda stupid  not to take the precaution seeing as how we were walking into a dark,  falling apart building. That's just asking for trouble.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The blast had had been  at once the best and worst thing she had ever heard. \"What did you  shoot him with?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Rock salt.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Excuse me?\"  Antonia knew it hadn't been shot, but salt? What was up with that?   Her eyes immediately landed on the white shaker on their table. It  was practically a condiment.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Salt repels ghosts,\"  said Dean through a mouthful of fries. He didn't blink as he said  it, just grabbed another fry and dragged it through more ketchup. He  didn't close his mouth when he chewed, either.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You made up that bit  about the ghost, didn't you,\" she said, picking at her own fries.   \"Because he wasn't there at all.\" Now, Antonia couldn't  wrap her head around . . . ghosts. Seriously, they were sitting in  McDonalds. It was like fast food negated even the possibility.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"We torched him last  night,\" said Sam. \"That's why we were out all night.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Didn't know how  losing the ghost's influence would affect Linda's dad.\" Dean  flicked his eyebrows as if that were all the explanation necessary.  Maybe it was. Antonia shook her head.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Never mind. I don't  want to know,\" she said. It was all too much, but Antonia didn't  know whether she was overwhelmed or just empty of everything,  drained.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, you okay?\"  Dean had asked her before, a brief touch on her arm before they ran  off to find Sam. Antonia still didn't have an answer and shook her  head because she couldn't form thoughts either. \"That was good  what you did back there,\" said Dean. \"Stupid but brave. Warned  us. Gave us the time we needed to get him.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"All you did was  stand there with your gun.\" It didn't quite come out as a  criticism. If he hadn't been there . . . she couldn't even bring  herself to think it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, I'm trying to  say thanks here.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You're doing a  crappy job of it,\" Antonia told him. \"But you're welcome  anyway.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The smile Dean flashed  her was wry, but warm. \"You gonna eat that?\" he asked pointing  at the other half of her burger.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" she said  because he was talking with his mouth full again and it was  disgusting. To make her point she took a big bite and didn't quite  regret it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That's  attractive,\" Dean rolled his eyes at her, and the snort Sam made at  the face she made trying to keep her mouth closed earned him an elbow  in the ribs from Dean who then snatched some of his fries. Sam  retaliated by shoving back and trying to stop them from going into  Dean's mouth, grabbing his arm, the two of them scuffling until  Dean had him in a head lock \xE2\x80\x93 \"Num! Num! Num! So good!\" Dean  chewed directly in his ear.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Let go of me, you  jerk,\" Sam scrabbled at the arm pinning him, but Dean just gave him  a noogie, laughing. Antonia had to cover her mouth because she was  laughing, too.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The grin on Dean's  face was bright and unfettered, and Antonia would wave sworn he  pulled Sam closer before letting him go with a shove. \"Bitch,\"  he said fondly. Sam scowled, running a hand through his hair, though  Antonia had no idea why he thought it would make it look better.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dude, you got grease  in my hair.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dude, there was  already grease in your hair.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No, there wasn't.\"   Sam elbowed Dean again who turned hurt eyes to Antonia.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You see what I have  to put up with?\" Given the monumental pout on Sam's face,  Antonia had no doubt, but this side of Dean she was seeing, playful  and with a ketchup smear on the corner of his mouth, didn't seem to  mind.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia managed to chew  and swallow the horrendous burger bite, sighing and slumping back  when she could breathe again. She was still tired and still felt  like she was walking in a world outside her own, but inside, pieces  were shifting and resettling and she was starting to be okay with  that.</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>Now Homecoming is  a social event that I can get behind. I've gone very year because  I can always talk my way into time off work and my mom always gets  excited about Homecoming and Prom and practically makes me go since I  don't get to do stuff like this often. I love it. I don't know  who I'm going with. If I don't get asked, I'm going anyway.  Nothing can stop me.</b></i><p><i><b>I like it. It's  fun.

It was sweet,  even if he's totally crazy for even thinking I'd go with someone  else. Who would I go with?

    <hr>\r\n\
    <p>There was a buzz in the  air at school on Monday. Everyone had seen or at least heard the  news about how Linda was found after an anonymous 911 call. Her  father was found at the scene, bound and unconscious, and he had been  arrested for the kidnapping and battery of his daughter. There  weren't any real details yet; the police still had the crime scene  closed and were playing it close to their chests for now.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't need  to know details; she'd been there. Dean's need to keep himself  and his illegal weapons under wraps had convinced her to keep quiet.  Theirs was a secret worth keeping, and besides she'd spent Sunday  composing an anonymous letter to the police because what happened was  a secret worth exposing.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So? Any idea who  found her?\" asked Maggie, joining her at her locker.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What? Why are you  asking me?\" Antonia was only able to half hide her smile in spite  of herself.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Because you're the  one who's been such a wreck about this,\" said Maggie. \"I know  with . . . what happened before it was bothering you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"With how Bianca was  kidnapped freshman year,\" Antonia turned and faced Maggie fully,  feeling like she was facing herself. \"How her father beat her and  . . .\" she stumbled over the words, \" . . . and raped her.\"  She closed her eyes briefly, seeing again Bianca's broken body, but  this time she also saw the girl who grabbed that poker.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She opened her eyes  because she could face this. Maggie was looking at her with an  uncertain expression. Antonia didn't blame her and tried to smile  a reassurance, surprised to find it easier than she expected.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" said Maggie  softly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Antonia  agreed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Homeroom and English  passed in a haze of how-school-never-applies-to-the-real-world.  Antonia still couldn't quite believe everything that had happened  that weekend. Part of her still couldn't quite believe that school  was the same as ever despite how everything had changed. When  Calculus arrived, she was almost surprised that she hadn't made up  Dean when he strolled in and nodded to her. She'd beaten Daniel to  the seat next to his, fending off her friend's frown with a casual  eye roll and, \"I'm not going to let Dean ruin this seat forever.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean once again pulled  out nothing more than his spiral notebook with more doodles of naked  women than math as Mr. Falk got class started. Antonia watched out  of the corner of her eye as Dean tuned out and, curious, scratched  out a note.</p>\r\n\
    <p>'Do you ever do your  homework?' she wrote.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean raised his  eyebrows at her when she passed it to him, laughing silently when he  read it. He scribbled an answer back and waited for Mr. Falk to turn  to the board before passing it back.</p>\r\n\
    <p>'No. I have no idea  what's going on in here.' He shrugged when she glanced at him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Sam thought it would  be funny,\" he said at the end of class as they were filing out.  \"He was in charge of registering us for school since he says me and  dad always put him in the wrong grade or some crap like that.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>She could see Sam doing  that, just for spite. \"You've moved before?\" she asked.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Couple times a  year.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia blinked at that  because that wasn't what she'd been expecting. \"Why?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean shrugged again but  this time with forced casualness, his gaze wandering off down the  hallway. \"We go where the work is,\" he said, and Antonia knew  instinctively that he wasn't talking about a normal nine-to-five  job.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Ghost hunting,\"  she said softly, getting a quick glance and a small nod in  acknowledgement. Antonia tried to wrap her mind around that thought,  but it was too big, too different. All she'd ever known was this  town, these people. She couldn't imagine. Even with their own  ghost and their own tragedies, Rockford was such a nothing place in  the middle of a big country. It could have so easily been forgotten  on the wayside. \"Why here?\" she asked.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Huh?\" Dean glanced  over, puzzled. \"What do you mean?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Why did you come  here? If you go after ghosts, aren't there others you could have  picked instead?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"There was one here,  too,\" said Dean, not getting it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, but \xE2\x80\x93\"  Antonia stopped because she'd been about to ask, \"why bother  here?\" but maybe she knew the answer already. \"Can I see them?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"See what?\" Dean  was still frowning, obviously not as adept at reading her mind as she  was at finding people.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"The files, or notes,  or whatever you found on the other kids.\" Because even if the rest  of them had died, they shouldn't be forgotten.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean was still staring  at her, paused in front of the door to the senior lounge and  confused, but something of what she meant must have been written on  her face because he nodded after a moment. \"Yeah.\"</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <i>The most outrageous  rumor I ever heard was that Kristina was pregnant and that was why  she was throwing up in the girls' bathroom after lunch everyday for  a while. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it turned out that  she was bulimic. I have no idea what the status of that rumor is.  She's on the thin side but doesn't really look unhealthy.</i><p><i>Rumors? I don't  know. All I know is that news travels fast through this school.  Mostly through girl channels, I mean you and Hillary alone are like  the telephone company. It comes out about the same anyway.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I don't even know  where to begin. Where should I begin? Ninth grade and how you and  Bianca imploded? You guys used to be tight, and then bam, you aren't  even speaking to each other. You guys had the fight of the year.  Tenth grade was all about Allison, Dave, and Pete in the love  triangle of epic proportions. Titanic had nothing on them. First  she and Dave are all set to get married, then Pete and her are  sneaking around under the bleachers right where anyone can see them.  Then Allison's back with Dave then she's with Pete and Dave is  kicked to the curb, literally when she leaves his ass at the mall  because of something he said. I still don't think anyone knows. I  doubt they even remember. It was better than TV, I can tell you  that.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>The only rumors I  care about are the ones that impact the football team. Everything  else is small potatoes. Hillary lets me know what I need to anyway,  so I don't worry about it that much.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>My favorite rumor  was the one where there was a cat being hidden in D wing. I don't  remember who made it up but the whole school was looking for it  without letting the teachers know about it. It was pretty hilarious  to watch people peering into janitor's closets and the corners of  the locker clump looking for a cat that wasn't there. Rumors are  weird things because even after it was debunked people still kept  looking.</i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i>I hate rumors even  though there's not a lot I can do about them. There's been a  bunch of crazy stuff said about me, stuff that wasn't true, like  that I was gay for Ben. None of it's true and it really hurt at  the time. Now I just ask who said it and how did they know, right in  their face and they shut up about it.</i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>In Study Hall, Antonia  settled on her usual couch with Allison while Kristen not so subtly  settled next to Dean across the room.<p>\"She and Brad had  another fight,\" Allison leaned towards her to say. \"Brad's all  mad because of how everyone was talking about how she and Kristina  were hanging out with Dean, and Kristen was mad because he was boring  and they never did anything different so now she wants Dean to ask  her to Homecoming to make Brad jealous.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"When did this  happen?\" Antonia couldn't help the curiosity. At this point, it  was as ingrained as breathing.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"After homeroom,\"  said Allison. \"Hillary was there and she said it was huge. Kelly  thinks they're going to break up soon. She was saying how they  almost always fight now, ever since the big blow up just before  school started. I heard it was just after they did it, too.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>That's what Antonia  had heard as well, from Kristina who could usually be counted on to  be accurate when it came to Kristen. Dean seemed to be enjoying the  attention at any rate. He'd slipped back into his bad boy attitude  with a pretty little slouch and a smirk that didn't quite reach his  eyes. Given the way he'd handled himself over the weekend, perhaps  he'd earned the right to be that confident in himself. Antonia  could be generous.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Since she had actual  Spanish homework to do, Antonia firmly corralled her attention from  the flirting and giggling that was going on across the room, and  after a little while was even able to get into the groove enough to  get most of the questions answered with what she hoped was a minimal  amount of grammatical errors.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So who are you going  to Homecoming with?\" asked Allison ten minutes before lunch when  she was packing up her things.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Daniel,\" said  Antonia absently as she did one more check of subject-verb agreement.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Really? I thought  you were just friends.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"We are,\" said  Antonia. It was as good as it was going to get on an empty stomach  so she began putting her books back in her bag, too. \"Maggie got  asked by Jason and Heather really wanted to go with Ari so she paired  us off instead of asking him directly.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Sneaky!\" Allison  grinned. \"And you and Daniel?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What? We're  friends.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh, come on,\"  Allison had a gossip-mongering grin peeking out. \"You've spent  so much more time hanging out with him this year than you did last  year. It used to be you and Maggie. Now it's you and Daniel.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia rolled her  eyes. \"We're friends. He's a good guy.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Would you date him?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Would you?  Seriously, now. He's cute, he's smart, he's on the track team.   You're already friends.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Allison wasn't giving  up. Antonia huffed a laugh at her persistence, but thought about it.   Daniel was a good friend and she'd be lying if she hadn't  thought about it, but that had been back when he and Maggie had a  thing going on back and forth, and now? He wasn't the first guy  she thought about dating, but . . . \"Yeah, I guess. If he asked.\"   Allison raised her eyebrows meaningfully. \"And no, Heather saying  we had to go together does not count.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Whatever,\" said  Allison. Thankfully, the bell rang after that original comeback,  cutting off the horrible conversation as they split out the door to  meet up with their respective groups of friends. Ahead of her down  the hall, Kristen had her hand on Dean's arm, laughing again and  making Antonia roll her eyes at the two of them. It was so typical.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The cafeteria was as  noisy as ever. Everything was the same as usual, and the floating  feeling from that morning had evaporated while Antonia had been  trying to remember how to conjugate poder into the past subjunctive.  She sat back for a moment as Daniel and Ari tried to steer the  conversation away from dresses with high falsettos pretending to put  on makeup. There was so much life in here that it made Antonia itch  to pull out her camera, save it and bottle it up to give to someone  to say, see? This is what life and high school should be.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Near the center of the  room, Dean had been dragged over to sit next to Kristen with Keith  and Kristina and those guys. Allison and Emily and a few other  cheerleaders sat nearby while Ashley, Pete, and their crowd had all  somehow managed wear solid colors today.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Across the main aisle  on the East River side, it was just as loud, just as carefree, even  at Bianca's table where she laughed with an ease that Antonia had  watched from this distance for going on three years.</p>\r\n\
    <p>That night, when Bianca  had taken that swing at her dad or maybe at the ghost, Antonia  doubted she even knew anymore, afterwards they both had thought it  was the wrong decision. Bianca was crazy with pain, Antonia was  seeing things, and they both knew that it hadn't been her dad's  fault, not really. That's what they told themselves. That's  what everyone else said. Looking back, Antonia could see now that it  was the lie that had broken their friendship because they couldn't  lie to each other.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Where you going?\"  asked Daniel when Antonia stood up.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I need a Coke,\"  she told him, but instead of going to the machine at their end of the  cafeteria, she went to the one at Bianca's.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Bianca,\" she  said when she got to Bianca's table. All her friends looked up  with her and stared, but for once Antonia didn't care about them or  what anyone else thought of her for coming over here.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" said Bianca,  her eyes not leaving Antonia's.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I just wanted to say  I'm sorry,\" she said, a rueful smile breaking free at the utter  inadequacy of the words. \"I'm sorry for everything. I didn't  say that last time, and I should have.\" Bianca's expression  shifted from confused to guarded, but Antonia went on before she  could say anything. \"I always believed you. I just . . . just  couldn't deal with it, and I'm sorry for that too because I  should have been there for you no matter what and I'm sorry that I  wasn't.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I wasn't any fun  to be around,\" said Bianca, almost shy, glancing at her friends  self-consciously. She wasn't lying. When she'd come back to  school she'd been worse than she'd been before she had  disappeared. They'd avoided each other a lot back then, and had a  couple of spectacular fights that sealed the deal.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm still sorry.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Bianca didn't look  away this time. \"Me too.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>For the first time in a  long time, Antonia could sense the connection that had been there  since the third grade. It wouldn't ever be the same, too much had  happened, they had different friends, different lives. They couldn't  go back, but maybe they could go forward. She smiled, warmed by the  thought, and went on to the vending machine.</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>I know I've  been going on about how I have no time with working after school and  stuff, and I don't, but I still try to make time for my friends  because without them I would go insane.

    <p>\"So what's up with  you and Bianca?\" asked Daniel on Wednesday as they arrived for  Calculus.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia looked at him  as they took their seats, wondering why he was asking. There was  nothing up with her and Bianca. They weren't going out of their  way to avoid each other was all. Yesterday they'd even had a whole  conversation that wasn't fraught with tension and weighty history.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Nothing's up,\"  she said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No, something's  up,\" said Daniel, jokingly but not. \"Come on, you can tell me.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"There's nothing to  tell,\" Antonia told him. \"Really.\" It was between the two of  them anyway.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Okay.\" Daniel  clearly didn't believe her. \"I just thought you were done with  that crap.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia blinked, not  sure she'd heard right. \"What?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That crap,\" Daniel  repeated. \"The drinking and the hard core partying.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It was ninth grade.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You were half crazy  in ninth grade, and it was because of her. She was mixed up in some  bad stuff.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You didn't even  know me back then,\" Antonia retorted, stung, because what the hell?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I knew what was  going on though. Everyone did,\" said Daniel as if it were obvious,  as if every rumor that came out of the woodwork were true. Antonia  knew rumors; she'd started enough of them, she'd lived through  enough of them to know that truth had very little to do with it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No,\" Antonia  hissed because Mr. Falk was at the board and ready to start class.  On her other side she could feel Dean staring at them, along with  everybody else. \"You really didn't.\" She turned abruptly,  unable to even look at him. She couldn't focus through the  lecture. She barely noted the homework problems she missed because  she knew the rumors he was talking about, the ones where Bianca was a  slut, where she was a drunk, where she was a freak. They'd started  before her dad had kidnapped her, and they had only gotten worse when  she'd been falling apart afterwards.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" Daniel  caught her arm after the bell, but Antonia shook him off. \"What's  with you?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Nothing is 'with  me,'\" Antonia snapped, storming into the hallway. \"Nothing is  wrong with me. Nothing is wrong with Bianca. And nothing is wrong  with us being friends.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I didn't say  that!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You meant it!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I did not!\"  Daniel looked genuinely surprised.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Then what exactly  did you mean by 'that crap'? Because that sounds a lot like you  think anything to do with Bianca is wrong.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You're  overreacting,\" Daniel rolled his eyes. \"I didn't mean \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia stopped  abruptly in the middle of the corridor to turn and face him. \"What?\"   Daniel tried to get her out of the way, but Antonia refused to move.   She was tired of being pushed around on this. \"What, exactly, did  you mean?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Nothing,\" he said.   \"Come on. Forget I said anything.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Do you have any idea  what she went through?\" said Antonia. \"That 'crap'? Post  Traumatic Stress Syndrome. It's common in people who get beaten up  and left to die. Look it up.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>But she was already  heading for Study Hall.</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>I don't think I  have more responsibility than I used to. My mom's always expected  a lot from me. I've been working since the end of ninth grade to  help out. I guess what's different as I get older is my mom being  more appreciative of the sacrifices I've made. She looks at me  sometimes with this sad look on her face and says, \"I'm so  sorry,\" because I've had to give up a lot of the normal teenage  things. I don't mind though. Well, not that much. Okay, a lot  sometimes, but that's life. And it's not fair. My mom needs the  help and it's up to me to be there and do what I can because no one  else will.</b></i><p><i><b>My curfew's  later, if that's what you mean. My mom trusts me to be smart when  I'm out and she's not on my case as much. I feel older. I feel  like I can give advice to the freshman and be right and not look like  an idiot. I like that, because it's like, finally! I know  something.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>My dad got me my  own key to the car right before school started. That was pretty big.   It's our only car, and he's trusting me with it when I go out,  and I don't have to beg the keys from him anymore. It's like I'm  finally an adult in our family.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>What hit me when  school started was that I might be leaving at the end of the year  like Louis.

Brian's going to get his learner's permit this year, so I'll  probably need to help teach him how to drive. When I think about it,  there's all these things. Then I think about it some more and I  wonder if I'm ready to leave.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>What I feel  responsible for is my future.

That's what I hold onto anyway, when  everything else around me seems to say that I can't pass math, how  am I supposed to make a future for myself. Sometimes I don't think  it's possible, but I hold onto it anyway because if I don't . . .  well I don't know.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>I've always  been responsible for a lot of things. Taking care of my brother when  Dad's gone, helping out on jobs, whatever else needs to get done.  It's a lot of responsibility maybe, but it's always been that  way.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <hr>\r\n\
    <p>By the end of the day,  Antonia was a crazy bitch all over school. Maggie was sticking by  her, but Heather and Ari were back and forth just wanting everyone to  get along. Antonia ate lunch at Bianca's table and met some of her  other friends properly, Brittany, Felicia, and Marta.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"He was just looking  out for you,\" Hillary told her in Chemistry. \"You're lucky  he's still going to Homecoming with you.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm not,\"  Antonia replied. She hadn't thought about it until that second but  there was no way she was going with Daniel now. No way in hell.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Well, you're not  going to find another date,\" said Hillary. \"Not this last minute  and not after that little show. So just make up with him already.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The sad truth was she  was right. There was no way to get a date two days before the dance,  and the humiliation of showing up dateless to Homecoming, especially  after this, well, Antonia might as well stay home. Which would mean  losing.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Which was why she  lingered after school by her locker until Dean showed up.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" she said,  ignoring the butterflies in her stomach and the complete overthrow of  tradition she was about to commit.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Antonia.\"  Dean smiled at her, a real smile that touched his eyes. \"I heard  you busted someone else's balls today. All in a day's work,  eh?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The light, playful tone  startled a smile out of her. \"Yeah,\" she said. \"Daniel, my  Homecoming date. Possibly ex-friend.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean shoved a few books  into his locker, letting them fall haphazardly. \"I saw you hanging  out with Bianca.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, we're trying  to be friends again. It's why Daniel got mad. It's stupid.\"  She watched him as he emptied everything out until his bookbag was as  empty as it always seemed. She wondered what other classes Sam had  signed him up for.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Sounds like.\"  Done, Dean closed his locker and gave her his full attention. Right.   She'd come to him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So.\" She took a  breath. \"You wanna go to Homecoming with me?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>That got a response:  two eyebrows and genuine surprise. \"Homecoming?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You know, dance,  football game somewhere in there. You can say no if you want,\" she  added hastily. This was such a bad idea. No wonder guys always  sounded like idiots when they did this.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Well, Kristen seems  to want to go with me,\" said Dean, tilting his head a bit, and  Antonia told herself it was a stupid idea to even ask him in the  first place. They'd spent the first three weeks they'd known  each other sniping, and of course, he'd prefer bubbly Kristen to  her. God, she must sound so desperate, especially since she was  asking <i>him</i> of all people. She was breaking pretty much every  social rule that Rockford had. Ever.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Okay. See you later  then. You still owe me an interview.\" She turned and headed for  the door, a blush creeping over her face, burning with the  embarrassment of asking Dean Winchester to Homecoming.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Antonia!\"  Dean called out behind her, loud enough for everyone to turn and  stare, including her. Dean had that stupid smirk on his face that  she hated. \"I'll go to the dance with you.\" He winked and  didn't give her time to recover before sauntering off, meeting Sam  at the end of the hall. She saw Sam shove him and could almost hear  him calling Dean a jerk.</p>\r\n\
    <p>In her part of the  hall, people were still staring but hurriedly glancing away when her  eyes turned on them. Cowards, all of them. Hillary and her friends  were the only ones to openly stare. With all the talk that had gone  around about Dean, it was more than a little gratifying. Giving  Hillary a sweet smile, Antonia decided that bucking tradition was a  very good thing after all.</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>The biggest  challenge I faced in high school was learning how to drive. I know  it's stupid, everyone does it. But with my mom working all the  time, me working, and we sure as hell couldn't afford Driver's  Ed, it took me forever. I don't tell anyone this. It's too  embarrassing. But it took me almost a year to pass my driver's  test. I could only practice about once a week, if that, and for a  while there I didn't think I'd ever get my license.</b></i><p><i><b>One of the  challenges I faced last year, that I didn't expect, was all of a  sudden everyone at track giving me the cold shoulder. It was weird  because it happened right after we had a really great meet against  Lincoln and I did really well in the eight hundred meter race. Then  the next week it was like I had killed someone's dog or something.  I kept asking what was going on and no one would say anything. It  hurt, you know, because I thought I was part of the team and suddenly  I wasn't. I felt all alone. It passes a few weeks later and  things eased back to being normal. But it was the longest two weeks  of my life. I still don't know what went on.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>School has been  my biggest challenge. I've always done pretty well in my classes,  but it wasn't till Mr. Jones starting talking about college and I  could get a scholarship and that made it real. I wanted it.

But I've done okay so far, and I think after I getting  through last year, I've got a shot at those scholarships.</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>A challenge I've  faced. I dunno. I guess the last challenge I faced was keeping my  little sister from dating a complete ass.

    <p>Friday night, the  cafeteria was transformed. White and gold streamers arched around  the ceiling while underneath the tables had been cleared away to make  a dance floor. The school had hired a DJ for the night and already  people were swaying to the music.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was always fun to  see everyone all dressed up. It wasn't Prom or anything, so the  dresses tended toward the last of the summer fashions and the guys  wore suits instead of tuxes. Antonia had been pleasantly surprised  by Dean who cleaned up very nicely indeed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Didn't think I  owned a suit, did you?\" he'd asked when he'd picked her up.  Since Antonia had asked a few rather pointed questions in that  direction after they finished with Dean's interview for the  documentary \xE2\x80\x93 finally \xE2\x80\x93 she couldn't blame him for calling her  on it. Especially when he looked that good in a button down shirt  and a tie, the jacket abandoned in the car.</p>\r\n\
    <p>They got a few looks  when they walked in, but nothing worse than what Antonia would have  expected. Things had settled down from Wednesday, even though Daniel  still wasn't speaking to her and Heather and Ari were still trying  to get them back together. Maggie had the best advice, having dealt  with Daniel in a snit before: ignore him until he feels like growing  a brain. He wasn't here yet, and as of the last bell of the day,  he'd asked a sophomore on the track team to go with him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia, you look  quite wonderful,\" Maggie greeted them with a grin. \"Hi, Dean.  This is Jason,\" she introduced another of the  he-cleans-up-just-fine persuasion. Antonia didn't know him very  well but he was smiling when he did the guy thing with Dean without  all the extra posturing that Dean tended to evoke since his  suspension, so Antonia gave him extra points and a subtle thumbs up  to Maggie.</p>\r\n\
    <p>They chatted for bit,  mostly about who really had ended up coming with whom, and Kelly  totally won Best Dress. It was pale peach, cut in Marylyn Monroe  style that was simple and perfect for her body type. She looked  gorgeous in it. Antonia startled for a moment when Dean handed her a  cup of punch \xE2\x80\x93 so far unspiked \xE2\x80\x93 because she hadn't even  noticed that he and Jason had wandered off while she and Maggie  chatted.</p>\r\n\
    <p>More and more people  arrived. The football players and their dates came fashionably late  and en masse so everyone knew they had indeed arrived. It was hard  to miss with the hooting and the spontaneous cheers they started up.  They'd lost the game tonight by only three points and had played  the best they had all season. Antonia was proud of them, even if  they were noisy and annoying. Nevertheless, she needed to keep Dean  as far away from them as possible so she dragged him out onto the  dance floor despite his protests.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I really don't  dance,\" he said once she finally had both him and herself where she  wanted them. It was a semi-slow song, one of those that you could  dance pleasantly to separately or snuggle in close. They were  somewhere in between since Antonia had to keep her toes safe somehow.   For a guy who was pretty athletic, it took Dean a minute to get the  feel for it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Too bad,\" she  replied. \"I want to dance.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, you're the  one who asked me out. Shouldn't you be catering to my wishes?  Trying to win my heart?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Please, you're  lucky I asked you. I saved you from the humiliation of getting  thrown over by Kristen.\" She nodded to their left where Kristen  was seamlessly tucked up against Brad. By the end of the night,  Antonia would bet they'd be making out on the dance floor shortly  followed by a quick getaway.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Because you were  desperate,\" Dean retorted, that smirk appearing, and okay, he had a  point. That didn't mean she was going to admit to it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It's shameful how  far I've fallen. You do realize I'm never going to live this  down, right? Asking you?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Whatever. You like  me.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I do not!\" was her  instant reply, which Dean responded to with a pair of doubtful  eyebrows that clearly said she was crazy. He was such a jerk, and  Antonia hated how he looked at her, like he could see right through  her, like he knew her, the real her, and maybe he did a little better  than most. It was wonderful and terrible, and made her want to be  the person he saw when he told her that she wasn't crazy when he  came for her help in finding Linda because he believed in her even if  she didn't believe in herself. He saw a part of her that no one  else did. In return, she'd gotten a peek at who he really was  under all his bluff attitude. So maybe she did like him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean only grinned  wider. \"You look beautiful,\" he said. \"Especially when you're  mad.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia smacked him for  that, making him laugh, but she was warmed all the same and couldn't  help the delighted smile on her own face. When the music changed,  she didn't protest as he pulled her closer, sliding her own hands  from his shoulders to the back of his neck, warm to the touch.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You really are  beautiful,\" he said quietly, the smile dancing up into his eyes.  Then he bent his head and kissed her, soft and chaste and utterly  perfect.</p>\r\n\

    <p>\"So.\" Maggie  landed against Antonia's locker Monday morning. \"You and Dean.\"   She had a wicked grin on her face, eyes demanding details.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You and Jason,\"  Antonia parroted back.</p>\r\n\
    <p>If anything, Maggie's  grin got wider as she leaned in close. \"Totally made out in the  park. Best. Kisser. Ever.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Better than Simon?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Way better than  Simon,\" Maggie nodded emphatically. \"We're going out again  this weekend. So that's where I'll be.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Where are you  going?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Movies.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"To make out.\"  Antonia laughed, feeling giddy herself at the idea of sitting in the  back row of the movie theater.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" said Maggie  shamelessly. \"So. You and Dean . . . You were getting some  action on the dance floor.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Even now, Antonia  couldn't help the blush that stole up her face at their very public  first kiss. \"Way, way better than Larry. Or, you know, anyone,\"  she confessed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"And?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"And we went to an  empty parking lot on the river.\" She shrugged letting Maggie fill  in the rest for herself. They'd gotten to an enthusiastic second  base before Antonia accidentally clobbered him when he hit a ticklish  spot. Kissing had devolved into a tickle fight and ended with them  pressed close and holding onto each other tight, Antonia trapping  Dean's roving hands until they just cuddled and made out. It had  been pretty late by then, so they'd called it a night. Dean had to  be back before his dad got home, he hadn't really explained, but it  had still been one of the best nights ever.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You gotta give me  more than that,\" Maggie whined, but Antonia just shook her head and  changed the subject. She still wanted to keep Friday night all for  herself for a little while longer.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Did you watch the  news?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"About Linda?\"  Maggie nodded. \"Yeah. They released her from the hospital. It's  good news.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It's great news,\"  said Antonia. \"But I think the hardest part is what comes next.\"   It had been for Bianca. It had been for her and she hadn't even  been hurt. Linda's father was still in jail awaiting trial, and  Antonia prayed that Linda would get some sort of closure from that.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean hadn't shown up  by the time the bell rang, and he didn't show up in Calculus at  all. Antonia was disappointed and by lunch she was cranky. Maggie  and Heather both gave her sympathy as she let loose some of her  frustration. \"He didn't even call me this weekend.\" She'd  wanted him to. Wanted to call him, but she didn't have his number.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Boys are so clueless  sometimes,\" Heather agreed, casting a glance over at where Ari and  Daniel were eating with some guys from the track team. Her Friday  night had ended with the dance. Ari still hadn't figured out why  she was mad.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia just wished  Dean would show up, or even Sam so she could give him a message but  Sam wasn't there either. Bianca was on her way over, however.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia, this is for  you,\" she said by way of greeting, handing Antonia a thick manila  envelope with her name on it. \"Hey, Maggie. Hey, Heather.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What is this?\"  asked Antonia.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Bianca shrugged,  looking nervous. \"Dean left it in front of my apartment. I'm  pretty sure it was Dean.\" At Antonia's confusion, she added,  \"They skipped town this weekend, Dean and Sam and their dad.  Didn't even pay rent.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The news was like a  blow to the stomach. \"They did what? Why?\" Even Antonia could  hear the hurt in her own voice. After everything, Linda and the  ghost and Homecoming, they couldn't just leave. Things were just  getting good again.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry,\" said  Bianca, laying a hand on her shoulder. \"Their dad came and went a  lot. Kyle wasn't lying about how creepy it was. Friday night he  came back. Saturday morning they were gone. I didn't find out  till yesterday when our landlord came over bitching about the rent  and then I realized about the envelope . . .\" she trailed off.  \"I'm sorry.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No. No, it's  okay,\" said Antonia. She took a deep breath and tried to keep the  hurt in. She should have expected something like this. Dean had  moved more times than he could remember after all. Why should here  be any different? It wasn't like they were dating or anything.  \"I'm gonna \xE2\x80\x93\" Her throat closed over and she could feel the  sting of tears and she wasn't going to cry over Dean freakin'  Winchester, not during lunch in front of everyone. She didn't look  at her friends, grateful when they didn't say anything. \"I'm  okay,\" she finally managed, forcing a smile.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You'll be fine,\"  Bianca agreed. She squeezed Antonia's shoulder and it felt like  the truth.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Do you want us to  remind you of all the times he was a complete asshole?\" asked  Maggie.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Or recite all your  complaints against him?\" said Heather, making her laugh despite the  blurring of her vision because they had been pretty horrible to each  other. Then things had gotten horrible and he'd been pretty  amazing.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia didn't open  the envelope until she got home from school. Locking the door to her  room, she grabbed the scissors off her desk and settled on the bed.  Inside was an inch of paper, the printouts Dean had promised her of  all the articles about the other children.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Anna Lineus, Laura  Folke, Phillip Ousler, Katherine Buchanon, Lindsey Kohl, Perry  Grossman, Julia Andale, Alicia Scott, Bianca Harrison, and Linda  Karlyle.</p>\r\n\
    <p>He'd remembered that  she'd asked for them. Leafing through the pile, Antonia thought  about the scrapbook she could make with these, something more than  dry articles to remember them by. She already had a couple articles  to add for Linda.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Under the articles were  notes in a combination of handwritings. She recognized Dean's  scrawl on top of Sam's neater research. Comments, questions,  arrows pulling things together and underlined conclusions. There  were police reports and county grave records, a host of details that  had led them to the ghost, Antonia, and Linda. But the last page was  different. It was another article, but this one was cut from an  actual newspaper.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Third Man Drowns in  Desert After Religious Festival</p>\r\n\
    <p>The newspaper was from  New Mexico and dated on Thursday. She couldn't figure out why it  was there at first, but then she realized. It was where they had  gone next. Perhaps not the goodbye Antonia would have liked but at  least it was a goodbye of sorts and maybe something of an apology,  too. Dean and his family had ghosts to hunt. It's what they did  and as much as she wished it were different, that their move to  Rockford had been a real move and that Dean would show up tomorrow, a  jerk as always but the guy she really liked underneath, it wasn't  different. He was gone with ghosts to hunt, and Antonia was still  here with high school to finish.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It wasn't fair. In  fact, it pretty much sucked as much as anything could. A lot of  things sucked, she amended, setting the article aside and touching  Linda's picture. For her, this ghost story wouldn't be over  soon, if it ever was. It wasn't for Bianca; it wasn't for  Antonia. She couldn't just run off to the next big thing or ignore  it this time. Bianca's picture, half underneath, grinned up at  her, a bright contrast to the young woman of today shadowed by the  loss of innocence. Antonia remembered that girl, and she remembered  the other little girl who used to run beside her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Dean might have ghosts  to hunt off in New Mexico, but so did Antonia, right here.</p>\r\n\

    <i><b>I try not to pay  attention to rumors unless it's someone I know telling me who is  usually right. There are so many stories that get thrown around and  most of them are wrong somehow. It can be awful.</b></i><p><i><b>The best rumor  that went around school was the one about the cat in D wing. I swear  I almost saw it, like, twice, but it turned out to be a couple making  out in the janitor's closet. Crazy. I heard someone telling one  of the freshman about it the other day. Guess it's going to be a  tradition now, huh?</b></i></p>\r\n\
    <p><i><b>The worst rumor I  ever heard was about me. It got around that I wanted to be Class  President \xE2\x80\x93 I wanted to be on the Senate \xE2\x80\x93 and someone, who I'll  do the favor of not naming, starting talking shit about me  everywhere. She said all I cared about was forcing everyone to buy  lunch because I was a pig and ate my weight in pastries every day.  There was some other stuff too, but that was the one that made  everyone stare at me and snigger when I ate lunch.

    <p><i><b>That's the  thing about sports, and football especially. There's always a  story to tell afterwards.

    <p><i><b>I hate gossip and  I hate rumors because everyone thinks they know everything about  everyone, but most of it's just a mask.

    <p><i><b>What I've  learned is that there's always some truth buried somewhere in what  people say. And in what they don't say. Or in how they lie.

    <p>Epilogue</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia took a moment  to stare at the front doors of Rockford Senior High School under the  banner proclaiming \"Welcome Back Class of 1998!\" This was it,  her ten-year reunion. The big brick monstrosity that had felt like  such a prison in high school now looked small and worn, like an old  women wearing fresh makeup with the lights and music that were  pouring out of the cafeteria. Antonia sighed. She almost couldn't  believe that she'd bothered to come, but curiosity as much as  nostalgia had drawn her back.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She took a quick look  around the gym as she headed for the registration table where name  badges were laid out in neat little rows. There were streamers  hanging from the ceiling, a DJ playing danceable music and tables  spaced out around the room where people were milling around, talking,  and laughing. Antonia had barely kept up with anyone after  graduation except Maggie and the occasional run-in with someone when  she visited her parents.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Antonia?!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia blinked at the  woman manning the table. It took a moment to place her. \"Hillary?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh my god! It's  so good to see you!\" said Hillary. \"How are you? What are you  doing? You were one of the ones who kind of disappeared after  college.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was true. Antonia  had gone to school in Chicago and ended up staying. \"I'm good,\"  she said, feeling underdressed for the occasion next to Hillary.  \"I'm a cop.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"A cop?\" Hillary  stopped mid badge search to stare. \"You're kidding.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Antonia shook her head.   \"Missing persons in Chicago.\" She had a knack for finding  people after all, a knack that her captain called uncanny when she  couldn't quite explain how she knew where someone was.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Wow. I never would  have expected that,\" said Hillary, handing over her name tag.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What about you?\"  asked Antonia. Time had been good to Hillary and there was wedding  band on her ring finger.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh, nothing  spectacular like being a cop,\" said Hillary with a modesty that  Antonia didn't remember. \"I manage Lily's Boutique down at the  mall now. The hours are good so I can spend time with my kids.\"  She paused to fish out photos from her purse of a four and two year  old. \"That's James and Beth.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"They're  beautiful,\" said Antonia. They looked a lot like Hillary had as a  child, and were both grinning happily at the camera.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What about you? Are  you married?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No.\" Antonia  passed the pictures back. Her love life was a sad state of affairs  these days between her hours and her ever diminishing bullshit  limits. \"I'm between boyfriends right now,\" she felt the need  to clarify, feeling the old anxiety of not fitting in rising up  between them.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh. Well,\"  Hillary said, floundering for a second before adding brightly, \"We're  showing your documentary later. You remember that? That was a  really good idea you had because now we have this record of  everything from that year.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Of course Antonia  remembered. That project had been her life senior year. It felt  like it had changed her life. The final count had been two hundred  and ten seniors interviewed. Some of them short, some people  interviewed several times over the year. Candid interviews in the  halls, classes, football and basketball games, track meets, Debate  competitions, volunteer work, soccer practices, Prom. Antonia didn't  want to even think about the time she spent editing it into a two  hour essence of Rockford High. Her original cut had been about  fifteen hours long. She still had all the footage.</p>\r\n\
    <p>With a few more banal  pleasantries exchanged, Antonia made her escape in to the reunion  proper. She knew Maggie wasn't going to be there, but she saw Ari  who was doing well for himself in Real Estate and Heather who had  married her college boyfriend and was now living in Virginia with a  two month old. Antonia navigated those conversations through a  cloud, their lives so different now that she could barely remember  how it had been back in high school.</p>\r\n\
    <p>It wasn't long before  Antonia headed for the wall that had the old yearbook photos of  everyone in their class to avoid any more awkward conversations. The  wall was huge with wallet sized photos and a little blurb talking  about what that person was up to. A little gold star denoted if they  were planning on coming to the reunion or not. Bianca wasn't,  Antonia saw, but she had replied with her current address in St.  Louis and that she was working at the Humane Society there.</p>\r\n\
    <p>As Antonia's eyes  drifted over names and faces, her mind kept skipping back to some of  the stories she'd heard from them. Wilson ended up joining the  Marines and was in Iraq. Jim had played college football and was now  coaching in at a junior high in Lincoln. Ashley was here and had  gone to Law School, and Estelle was in graduate school for Bio and  Chemical Engineering. Brittany had moved up from grocery stores to a  manager position at Macy's, married now with two children. Whit  and Daniel had both been star runners for a while before coming home  and getting married. Whit taught tenth grade English, and Daniel had  taken over coaching track. Jake wasn't listed, the small note  beside his name that said simply \"Class of 1998.\" She wondered  if he had ever taken his band on tour.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The last name she  looked for didn't even have \"Class of\" beside it, instead it  just had the dates Dean had shown up for like birth and death dates  on a gravestone. It was oddly appropriate. The picture they had was  a still from the documentary, and probably the only reason he was  listed at all. He was grinning that stupid smirk she'd hated so  much, the one she'd seen more recently on a Wanted alert from the  FBI.</p>\r\n\
    <p>That had been the  surprise of her life, and Antonia had only wished for him to be there  to tell her she wasn't crazy when she called bullshit on his whole  case, much to the amusement of her colleagues. There wasn't much  she could do except poke holes in it over coffee but she wasn't  going to just let the condemnation stand. Dean Winchester was no  serial killer. She had a scrapbook of lost children that told her  otherwise. She had her career, her life's work, and a memory of a  Friday night that told her otherwise. She knew that wherever Dean  was, he was still hunting ghosts and still helping forgotten souls.</p>\r\n\
    <p>She brushed her finger  over his face one last time before standing up, satisfied in a way  that she couldn't quite explain. Over the years, Antonia had  learned not to worry about it, but to go with her gut, so she smiled,  glad she'd come back, glad to see faces she'd all but forgotten  and where they'd ended up. She thought about the camera wedged in  her handbag, and wondered if her classmates would mind sharing their  stories one last time.</p>\r\n\

    Section 18: Change in Down<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"So now what?" Daniel asked at large. The six of them stood stupidly in front of the ship just staring at it as if they were staring at a piece of art in a museum. Or, Daniel amended, as if by looking at it, they could glare the force field down. If looks could kill sort of thing. Unfortunately it wasn't working.</p>
    <p>They had tried everything they could think of so far. Jack had gotten himself a nasty shock testing the effectiveness of the shield. The DRD D'argo had sent in was sitting fried on the other side of the barrier. Sam had gone on for a minute after that about repulsive electromagnetic fields until Jack made her explain in English that nothing electronic or biologic was getting through without dying a horrible death. John had suggested they test her theory on Rygel.</p>
    <p>"Well," the question stirred Sam from the stillness that had come over the group. She moved closer to shield, studying the ship from all angles. "We know that insulators can pass through the shielding." She demonstrated with the cloth she still held in her hand from the previous test. "We might be able to make a shield of our own that will protect us from the electricity."</p>
    <p>"We don't have any lead on board," said John.</p>
    <p>"Surly you must have something for your own systems," Daniel countered. "Insulation of some sort . . ."</p>
    <p>"Anything," Sam turned to them again. "Casing, bundle wire insulation, large surge protectors, anything." Her eyes pleaded with John for an idea.</p>
    <p>But the black clad man simply shook his head. "Almost all that stuff is tied up either in Moya's nervous system or systems that keep her running. We can't use it."</p>
    <p>"All we need is a little, enough to wrap around a person to get in. We can take it from different places or places where she has excess insulation so there's no danger," said Sam.</p>
    <p>"When he said, we can't use it, he meant we can't use it," D'argo snapped. "The insulation we could use would be impossible to make into a cloak or shield of any kind and the stuff that might work we can't take away from Moya."</p>
    <p>"Don't you think the ship not exploding is a little more important than a few exposed circuits?" Jack bit out at his sarcastic best.</p>
    <p>"Those exposed circuits are her nervous system!" John shouted back. "It'd be like ripping off your skin with a dull knife! If we had an anesthetic, maybe. But we don't." The glare he leveled at Jack rivaled the colonel's best. "Moya would probably pass out, and with their weakened connection, Pilot would probably die."</p>
    <p>"And if Pilot dies, we all die, including Moya," D'argo finished in a deadly quiet voice.</p>
    <p>Suddenly Daniel felt the mortality of the ship and the gentle creature that guided her as he hadn't since they came aboard. It was one thing to learn that the vessel they were in was alive, another to hear the love and fierce protection of her friends at any mention of harm to her. "I guess we'll have to find another way then," Daniel offered in truce. One glance at the way Jack's eyes shifted over the surrounding walls told him his friend was also feeling it. As the Colonel met his own gaze, Daniel knew that Moya had suddenly landed in the category of 'innocent we'll die fighting to protect.'</p>
    <p>"What other ways are there to expel the ship?" asked Teal'c. "Its shield and size prevents us from moving it physically, therefore we must endeavor to find a way to take down the shield and get inside."</p>
    <p>And that about summed it up. Okay, time to start thinking. Work your way up. "What about a control device on one of the dead guys," Daniel suggested the simplest thing he could come up with.</p>
    <p>"And that would look like what?" John asked turning toward the remains from the C4 and subsequent shoot out lay scattered among the debris.</p>
    <p>"I don't know, anything," Daniel followed. "Something on their wrist like a small remote control, probably the same color as the ship.</p>
    <p>"O'Neill." Teal's voice, though not directed at them nevertheless stopped them in their tracks. The Jaffa looked intense, staring blankly at the ship the way one does when listening with other senses.</p>
    <p>"What is it?"</p>
    <p>"I believe the countdown has begun."</p>
    <p>They all turned to stare at the ship that held their collective fate in its hand. Jack summed it up nicely, "Crap!" Yeah, Daniel agreed. "Alright," Jack snapped into motion, moving swiftly to join Daniel and John. "Let's find something to get that shield down so we can throw that thing out!" The others followed his lead and soon all of them were searching bodies. It was unpleasant but Daniel found that if he avoided looking at the their faces, he could go through pockets without feeling too bad about it. He was an archeologist after all - going through a dead man's things was his job.</p>
    <p>Daniel crashed into someone before he could follow up on that thought. Startled, he looked up at John who was absently steadying him even as he stared at the ship behind him. "I got an idea," was all he said.</p>
    <p>"What?" "Crichton?" Jack and D'argo's surprise overlapped each others.</p>
    <p>"You said 'throw it out,'" John shot at Jack who looked as bewildered as everyone else felt. "We can do that. Pilot?" he called out without any further explanation.</p>
    <p>Pilot answered briefly in acknowledgement.</p>
    <p>"Can you get Moya to turn on her side so that the hangar door is toward the planet?"</p>
    <p>There was a pause and in that pause Daniel's eyes met Sam's in mutual enlightenment. By turning Moya, John was going to get gravity to pull the ship out.</p>
    <p>When Pilot answered this time, a smile broke out on John's face.</p>
    <p>"John," Aeryn's voice continued in English. "We'll have to flood the whole hangar and turn off Moya's artificial gravity so you better get my prowler out of there now!"</p>
    <p>John grinned at her request and turned to Jack. "You guys don't happen to be Air Force do you?" he asked hopefully.</p>
    <p>Jack just smiled. "What do you want me to fly?"</p>
    <p>The next few minutes were spent in a flurry of activity. John had Jack fly his small Earth-made ship while he took Aeryn's black fighter out of the hangar. The three of them, completed by D'argo in his own craft, were going to circle overhead while Pilot flooded the hangar to get the ship on its side. Since Moya's gravity would be dropped once they were in position, Daniel, Sam, and Teal'c, shortly joined by Aeryn were stowing as much of the mess of tools and equipment in the maintenance bay as possible.  When asked why this room, Aeryn told him that repair supplies were hard to come by and vital for survival. There was nothing else of value that could be damaged by a sudden change in down.</p>
    <p>"Looks like were getting close," said Sam when they had finally done as much as they could. She nodded toward the ship in the hangar that had started to glow purple. At the far end of the hangar, Daniel could see the water rushing in diagonally. It was a disconcerting sight even if he could feel the effects of planet's gravity starting to pull him in that direction.</p>
    <p>"Let's get out of here," said Aeryn. With stilted steps that had her body at an impossible angle with the floor, she crossed to close the inner hangar door before retreating with the rest of them into the hallway, the bay door closing and sealing behind them.</p>
    <p>"We should lean against the door so we don't fall and kill ourselves when it's time," said Sam putting words to action, and since it was a very sensible idea, they all followed suit. Aeryn briefly advised the others on the ship to do the same before falling silent with the rest of them. Daniel could hear the moving water through the door.</p>
    <p>"This is a crazy idea," he commented.</p>
    <p>Teal'c raised an eyebrow, and Sam and Aeryn said in perfect unison, "Aren't they all?" Teal'c's other eyebrow rose as he turned his attention to the two women who just looked at each other before smiling self-consciously.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn, Moya's almost there," said John over the communications system.</p>
    <p>"Alright, Pilot?" the raven haired woman respond. "We're ready whenever you are."</p>
    <p>Pilot replied, and even though he couldn't understand it, Daniel knew it was the signal. A moment later he felt the ship let them go, his weight relaxing completely against the door with the clang of metal on metal as objects on the other side of the door fell too. And then he heard the muted sounds of what only could be the ship knocking against the walls as it fell into the ocean.</p>
    <p>"Pilot?" Aeryn's voice was tense.</p>
    <p>He answered at length and Aeryn's expression never wavered to give any indication of what he was telling her. That is, until Pilot's own voice suddenly changed.</p>
    <p>"Brace for impact!" Aeryn shouted. A second later a shock waved hit them, jolting them into the air only to land painfully back on the door.</p>
    <p>"Pilot! Aeryn! Are you alright?" D'argo demanded as Jack's own, "Carter what happened? You okay?" filtered through the radio.</p>
    <p>"Fine, sir," Sam replied, sitting up painfully. "The ship must have exploded, but it was in the ocean. The water was a pretty good buffer."</p>
    <p>"D'argo," Aeryn addressed her own captain. "Pilot's cycling the water out of the airlocks now but it will be a while before Moya's righted. Once we're less vertical, he'll reengage the gravity."</p>
    <p>"Understood. We'll keep an eye out for any more attacks."</p>
    <p>Aeryn looked at her three companions after D'argo signed off. They were stuck on a sideways ship then with nothing to do but wait. "So you hungry?" she asked.</p>
    <p>With a quick glance at his teammates at this non sequitor, Daniel shrugged.  "Yeah."</p>
    <p>"Good, I'm starved." And with that Aeryn got up and led them toward the center chamber. Walking on the walls.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>I must say, I am proud of this part! I think I'm going to write Daniel more often. Sorry it took so long to update, but I only got this satisfying answer to their dilemma last night and I think it was worth the wait.</p>
    <p>Thanks for sticking with the story and writing encouraging reviews. I can tell you now that this story, due to an evil plot bunny Alynna let loose, is less than half done. So much for a short summer fic. So much for homework.</p>

    <p>"Christmas Eve," Gabriel announced unnecessarily, his voice drowsy as he watched the fire in the Great Hall.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Mm," Friedrich agreed.  He sat next to Gabriel and held out a glass of advocaat.  "Merry Christmas, Gabriel."</p>
    
    
    <p>"Yeah."  Gabriel took the glass and sipped it, smiling a little at the taste of brandy.  "You trying to get me drunk?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"If you get drunk on that, Gabriel, you are a very cheap date." Friedrich waved his own glass at Gabriel's. "I only added a little."</p>
    
    
    <p>"<i>You seemed to need it</i>," he didn't say, but Gabriel was well aware he couldn't hide his melancholy from Friedrich. <i>Even if he wasn't so damn good at reading me, I probably smell sad or something.</i> "Thanks."</p>
    
    
    <p>Friedrich just nodded.  "How's your leg?"</p>
    
    
    <p>Gabriel glanced down and shrugged. "Sore. Not too bad." Truth was, that...whatever it had been...probably would've taken it clean off if he hadn't had better-than-human reflexes. And it probably still would've been infected and broken if it weren't for how fast he healed these days. As it was... "Think I've been on it a bit too much. Feels good to be out of all those bandages, though."</p>
    
    
    <p>Another nod.  "It will heal, Gabriel. You must be patient."</p>
    
    
    <p>"Yeah, it'll heal." Small comfort when it had kept him from standing, let alone walking onto a plane, until the full moon. And there was no way he was chancing his nerves with customs and security then, which meant no travelling till after Christmas, and no seeing his Gran till New Year's.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Gabriel?" Friedrich prodded, almost gently.</p>
    
    
    <p>Gabriel sighed.  "She may not be around much longer, Friedrich. She's my last family, damn it; I just wanted to see her."</p>
    
    
    <p>"Call her." He held up a hand, meeting Gabriel's scowl with his own. "I know it won't be the same, but you should at least speak. And we will see her next week."</p>
    
    
    <p>Gabriel took a deep breath and pushed a hand through his hair, fighting down his frustration.  "Yeah."</p>
    
    
    <p>Friedrich finished the rest of his advocaat and stared into the glass, turning it around, watching the patterns the sticky drink left on the insides. "I have not had any family in a very long time."</p>
    
    
    <p>Gabriel winced. A long time &#151; by which he meant a couple hundred years.  <i>And that could be me in a while, too.</i>  "How do you do it?" It sounded more plaintive than he'd intended, but the thought of all those years...</p>
    
    
    <p>Friedrich's laugh was bitter. "I haven't, remember? I have kept trying to make my own family around me. Unsuccessfully, until you." He looked at Gabriel, his expression more open and haunted than Gabriel had seen it in a long time.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Friedrich," he started, but Friedrich shook his head, smiling sadly.</p>
    
    
    <p>"A wolf is a social creature; so is a man.  I can't tell you it isn't difficult, not with my history."</p>
    
    
    <p>"You give great pep talks, Friedrich, thanks," Gabriel said dryly.</p>
    
    
    <p>Friedrich laughed. "Well, so long as I have been an inspiration." He held out his hand for Gabriel's empty glass and stood. "Maybe I should just bring the brandy here, hm?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"Why not? We're not driving anywhere." Gabriel laughed and waved at the heavy snow outside the night-darkened windows. If Gerde couldn't even make it back from her parents' house, there was no way they were going anywhere, even if they had anywhere to be.</p>
    
    
    <p>"True."  Friedrich's voice drifted out from behind the bar.  He straightened, bringing a bottle and two tumblers back with him.</p>
    
    
    <p>"That's not the brandy," Gabriel accused, grinning.</p>
    
    
    <p>"I thought if we were going to get drunk, we might as well do it right," Friedrich retorted. He handed Gabriel a glass and displayed the label of the Scotch.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Fine with me." Gabriel held his glass while Friedrich poured.  "Cheers."</p>
    
    
    <p>"<i>Prost</i>."</p>
    
    
    <p>They touched their glasses, and Gabriel went back to staring into the fire as he sipped his Scotch. He could sense Friedrich next to him doing the same, but even if the silence was a bit sad, it wasn't uncomfortable.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Think there's anything good for the holiday on TV?" Gabriel asked, more for something to say than any real desire to watch. He could feel Friedrich shrug, and realised they'd slid closer together.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Probably. I'm sure we can watch the BBC if nothing else."</p>
    
    
    <p>"My German's getting a lot better, you know."</p>
    
    
    <p>"I know." He could hear the smile in Friedrich's voice, and his own heart lightened a little. "You've been doing remarkably well at a lot of things, Gabriel."</p>
    
    
    <p>"Yeah, tell what's-his-face at the drug store that."</p>
    
    
    <p>"Heinrich. And he was only upset because of the blood on his carpeting. He will forgive you."</p>
    
    
    <p>Gabriel snorted. "Next time I'll watch where I'm bleeding."</p>
    
    
    <p>"Do." Friedrich refilled their glasses.  "Though I would prefer it if you didn't bleed at all, you know."</p>
    
    
    <p>"You and me both!" Gabriel rolled his eyes. "I wasn't exactly planning on it, you know," he mimicked.</p>
    
    
    <p>Friedrich snorted, but caught Gabriel's hand as he lifted it to drink. Gabriel looked over questioningly and Friedrich met his eyes, the humour gone. "Please, Gabriel, be more careful with yourself. I would like to have you around for some time to come."</p>
    
    
    <p>He wanted to shrug it off, say of <i>course</i> he would be careful and who was Friedrich to order him around? But... <i>I'm the only one he has now.</i> "I...I'll try." He shrugged. "I can't promise more; I'd be lying, and you know it."</p>
    
    
    <p>"I know." Friedrich shook his head and pushed a lock of Gabriel's hair back behind his ear. Gabriel shook his head irritably and it dropped free again. "You are a very stubborn man. But trying is all I can ask, I suppose."</p>
    
    
    <p>"You know..." Gabriel hesitated, started again, stopped, opened his mouth to finish, took a drink, and blurted it out. "You need to be careful, too." He knocked his Scotch back in one gulp and held his glass out defiantly. Friedrich smiled and took the glass from him; their fingers caught, and Gabriel found himself gripping his hand tightly, unable to let go. "You need to be really careful," he growled.</p>
    
    
    <p>"I will be as careful as I can, Gabriel." With his free hand, Friedrich tucked that hair back behind Gabriel's ear again, and he sighed but let him. "Besides, I have a Schattenj&auml;ger looking out for me now, don't I?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"And I've got a bossy as hell werewolf looking out for me. I dunno, you think it's a fair trade?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"I am very happy with it." Friedrich leaned forward, his hand still wrapped in Gabriel's hair, and brushed their lips together. Gabriel followed, deepening the kiss, their lips clinging as he flicked his tongue out to taste Friedrich's. He wrapped his arms around him, feeling the heat of his body, more warming than the fireplace.</p>
    
    
    <p>Friedrich trailed his mouth over Gabriel's jaw, kissing that spot right under his ear. He sighed, and Gabriel shivered at the breath over his skin. "What about you, Gabriel?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"Hm?"  Gabriel nuzzled Friedrich's hair, losing track of the conversation again.</p>
    
    
    <p>Friedrich stopped him with a firm but gentle hand on his chest, pushing him just far enough away to meet his eyes. "Is it a fair trade?" He ran his hand up to Gabriel's shoulder, settling it at the base of his neck. His thumb stroked in a way that made Gabriel want to pull him right back down, but there was a warning there, too, a demand for an answer.</p>
    
    
    <p>Gabriel sighed. "It's a fair trade," he agreed. He swallowed and met Friedrich's eyes. "I don't know if I'd make it again, and I can't say it doesn't still scare me sometimes. But I'm here." He tried a smile, and mostly managed. "You're stuck with me now."</p>
    
    
    <p>"As I said, a fair trade." Friedrich smiled at him.  "More than fair."</p>
    
    
    <p>Gabriel grinned. "I'm the best trade anyone'd ever have."  Friedrich snorted. "So you gonna pour me some more, or what?"</p>
    
    
    <p>Friedrich picked up the almost forgotten bottle and topped off both their glasses. "Maybe we should wait until after our presents, or we might be too drunk to read the tags."</p>
    
    
    <p>"Mine are the square ones; yours're the ones that look like a drunk monkey wrapped them up. Hm." Gabriel grimaced. "Except I had one for Gerde, too. Unless you really want a copy of <i>An Encyclopedia of Flower Arrangement</i>."</p>
    
    
    <p>"No, thank you!  And I sincerely doubt you would be interested in a bottle of wine and an assortment of yarn."</p>
    
    
    <p>"Yeah, no." Gabriel snorted. "So let's pull ours out and set 'em here. Then we can get as drunk as we want."</p>
    
    
    <p>"If you like." Friedrich pushed up and strode over to the tree; he must have been at least a little buzzed, but it didn't show in the graceful, predatory walk. He leant over to go through the presents, and Gabriel leaned to keep an eye on him, ogling his ass.</p>
    
    
    <p>He grinned and shrugged when Friedrich turned and caught him at it.  "Just looking at what I'll get to unwrap later."</p>
    
    
    <p>"Only if you're a very good boy," Friedrich drawled, and set the packages down in the chair by the fire.</p>
    
    
    <p>"I am <i>always</i> good," Gabriel declared, his grin even wider.</p>
    
    
    <p>"Of course you are." Friedrich sat back down, waving at the small pile of presents. "I thought we would wait until tomorrow to open Gerde's; she should be back once the roads are clear. Anyway, that's your tradition, isn't it? Christmas morning?"</p>
    
    
    <p>"Yep." Gabriel nodded, the second bob of his head more careful than the first as the room spun just a little. "I always hated waiting, though."</p>
    
    
    <p>"I have noticed that about you," Friedrich agreed, deadpan, and Gabriel glared at him.</p>
    
    
    <p>"I can take your present back, you know."</p>
    
    
    <p>"No, no, that's perfectly all right." Friedrich laughed. "You really are incorrigible, Gabriel."</p>
    
    
    <p>"Yep," he agreed again, toasting Friedrich.</p>
    
    
    <p>Friedrich shook his head and toasted back, then watched Gabriel with a smile on his face. Gabriel cocked his head, waiting, and Friedrich stroked his face. "Some things are worth waiting for, though."</p>
    
    
    <p>Even that little touch did things to Gabriel, and he thought about how long Friedrich had had to wait for someone to share this with. Share his life, have someone who really understood and cared anyway. <i>And he's not the only one.</i> He finished his glass and set it aside, reaching for Friedrich again. "Yeah, I guess they are."</p>

    <p>Pippin adjusted his surcoat 
        again and scowled at his reflection. His guard uniform simply didn't look 
        right without the boots, but Diamond had flat forbidden him to wear <i>shoes</i> 
        to the celebrations, even if he had worn them in the original battle. And 
        truth be told, he still preferred feeling ground beneath his feet, despite 
        a deep, irrational fear that Aragorn would show up in the midst of everything 
        and scold him for the impropriety. </p>
    
    <p>"Peregrin Took, you look 
        fine and dashing," his wife informed him fondly from the other side of the 
        room. "Stop fussing." She walked over and stretched up to peck him on the 
        cheek as she finished tying her sash. </p>
    
    <p>"You always say that," 
        he protested as she shoved him before her out the door. </p>
    
    <p>"Well, it's nearly always 
        true. Now come on, we'll be late!" </p>
    
    <p>They hurried out of Bag 
        End and down the hill to the party field. Sam had been there all morning, 
        one of his burdens as Mayor; Rose, Marigold, and Tom had herded the youngsters 
        off earlier. <i>Four, and Rose due any day now.</i> Pippin shook his head. 
        He'd have one of his own, soon -- they'd just found out for certain a few 
        days ago -- but he couldn't even imagine having that many small ones at once. 
    </p>
    
    <p>They could hear the squealing 
        of various children as they made their way to the gate, and were nearly bowled 
        over by a pair of unknown youngsters on their way in. The younger stopped 
        to gape up at Pippin, and he mock-scowled at the boy, whose eyes widened before 
        he ran off after his friend. Pippin answered Diamond's sideways look with 
        an innocent expression, and she snorted indelicately. </p>
    
    <p>The field was a study 
        in gaiety and chaos -- every anniversary of the Battle of Bywater was a festive 
        occasion, but this year, the tenth, had been specially planned. Participants, 
        their descendants, and assorted well-wishers from throughout the Shire were 
        expected to turn up, preparations had begun a week previously, and nearly 
        every hobbit in Hobbiton and Bywater had helped in some way. The whole affair 
        reminded Pippin rather poignantly of Frodo's coming-of-age party, old Mr Bilbo's 
        last in the Shire. <i>But no fireworks this time,</i> he thought wistfully. 
        <i>No Gandalf. Though with any luck, no peculiar disappearances, either!</i> 
    </p>
    
    <p>"Takes your mind back, 
        don't it?" Sam came up and nodded around at the gathering. </p>
    
    <p>"Yes." Pippin nodded.</p>
    
    <p>"Mayor Gamgee," Diamond 
        greeted him politely. Then noticing Pippin's distraction, she touched him 
        lightly on the shoulder and wandered off to leave them together.</p>
    
    <p>Introspection not a natural 
        state of mind for him, though, Pippin soon shrugged it off, and hugged Sam 
        in welcome. Scanning the noisy, milling crowd, he voiced one of the only two 
        questions that mattered. "Is there plenty of food to go around?"</p>
    
    <p>Sam frowned worriedly, 
        though he nodded. "There ought to be. That is, we've got enough of the foodstuffs. 
        The only question is if we can cook it up fast enough. For all we started 
        yesterday, it's not near as quick to make as eat!"</p>
    
    <p>Pippin grinned cheekily 
        and slapped him on the back. "Best of luck to you, Master Mayor; I place perfect 
        trust in your ability."</p>
    
    <p>Sam squinted up at him. 
        "By which you mean to say, it's better me than you."</p>
    
    <p>"Exactly. Is --"</p>
    
    <p>"Mister Merry's not shown 
        yet, though I've no doubt he'll make it for elevenses," Sam answered. "If 
        you don't mind being useful till he does turn up, we've still some tables 
        and such as need setting out."</p>
    
    <p>Pippin laughed; one consequence 
        of being the biggest around was that he inevitably got drafted to help with 
        the lifting. <i>Oh, well,</i> he thought ruefully. <i>Need to keep able to 
        fit the uniform somehow.</i> "Lead on, Sam."</p>
    
    
    
    <p>He was straightening a 
        trestle, cursing his mailshirt and the unseasonable warmth impartially, when 
        a creak of leather behind him made him spin so fast Merry nearly spilled the 
        flagons of ale he carried.</p>
    
    <p>"Merry!" Grabbing the 
        ale and thunking it down unceremoniously on the table, Pippin threw his arms 
        around his best friend, and they hugged each other close.</p>
    
    <p>"It's so good to see you, 
        Pip." Merry's voice was thick with emotion.</p>
    
    <p>"And you." They each took 
        a half-step back, gazing long at each other, hands on their shoulders as if 
        afraid to let go. Merry in his horseman's boots topped Pip by several inches, 
        but he otherwise looked the same as ever. "It's been almost a year," Pippin 
        lamented.</p>
    
    <p>"Yes." Merry smiled wistfully. 
        "And longer since we've really spent some time together. Between my cousins 
        and your dad-in-law..."</p>
    
    <p>Pippin snorted. "If I 
        ever volunteer like that again, please tie me up and thump me soundly."</p>
    
    <p>Merry laughed and pulled 
        Pippin back into his arms. "I have missed you, Pip."</p>
    
    <p>"You remember that next 
        time you tell me to go soak my head," Pippin shot back cheerfully, poking 
        him in the chest. "Come on, then -- we'd best get out while we can, or they'll 
        put you to work as well. Hurry!" Grabbing Merry by the hand, he ran for the 
        back way, pulling him along.</p>
    
    <p>They made it out safely 
        and headed over the back side of Bag End and down to the water. Just the other 
        side of a small copse of trees, they threw themselves down breathlessly in 
        the long grass.</p>
    
    <p>Pippin picked his head 
        up long enough to peer back through the branches. "Don't think anyone saw 
        us," he said after a moment.</p>
    
    <p>"Peregrin Took," Merry 
        shook his head, "you're as daft as a tweenager. What if somebody needs us?"</p>
    
    <p>"For what?" Pippin asked 
        archly. "No speeches before supper, anyhow. Though now I think on it, I do 
        wish we'd rescued some ale first. I'm parched!" He leaned down to drink from 
        the river, dunking his face in for good measure.</p>
    
    <p>"I did try," Merry pointed 
        out.</p>
    
    <p>Pippin shrugged philosophically. 
        "We'll just have more later. To make up for lost time. Speaking of which..." 
        A glint in his eye, he leaned closer to Merry, close enough that their breath 
        mingled. "Hello." He leaned in the last inch, their lips melting slowly together. 
        This heat was welcome, and their tongues flicked out to touch and dance lightly 
        together, then dove deeper, each in turn.</p>
    
    <p>They were both breathing 
        heavily as they separated. Pippin smiled, then cocked his head at Merry's 
        stunned expression. "What is it? Merry?"</p>
    
    <p>Merry shook his head, 
        both to clear it and in answer. "I didn't know ... I wasn't sure that you 
        wanted to go on with me." It was Pippin's turn to look shocked, and Merry 
        shrugged at him uncomfortably. "You've got Diamond, now."</p>
    
    <p>Pippin frowned at him 
        fiercely. "Meriadoc Brandybuck, I told you it wouldn't make a difference. 
        It's sheer bad luck we haven't been together since then, and I mean to mend 
        that now." He reached out decisively and undid Merry's brooch, casting his 
        cloak to one side.</p>
    
    <p>"But what if --" Pippin 
        reached for Merry's buckles, but Merry grabbed his hand, his face growing 
        stern. "We've got duties now, Pip. You have a wife, you need an heir --"</p>
    
    <p>"Got one," Pippin informed 
        him succinctly.</p>
    
    <p>"What?"</p>
    
    <p>He grinned at having startled 
        his friend. "Diamond's carrying now. Mum says it's a boy, and she ought to 
        know."</p>
    
    <p>"How can she?" Merry asked, 
        momentarily distracted.</p>
    
    <p>Pippin shrugged. "How 
        am I supposed to know? Some female thing, no doubt. Come on, Merry," he pouted. 
        "Are you done being responsible yet?" He gave up on the disrobing and simply 
        launched himself at the other hobbit, landing full-length on top of him. He 
        nuzzled Merry's cheek and traced his jawline with the tip of his nose, then 
        leaned in further to lick along the tendons of his neck. </p>
    
    <p>Merry's breath caught 
        in his throat, but he shook his head. "I like Diamond --"</p>
    
    <p>Pippin ran his tongue 
        back up to Merry's lips and plunged it into his mouth in a fierce but brief 
        kiss. "So do I," he answered. "I like her very much. I like you more, and 
        she knows that. You don't think I'd try to keep it from her? Not that I probably 
        could," he acknowledged his wife's keen mind wryly.</p>
    
    <p>Merry looked up at him 
        searchingly, painful hope dawning on his face. "Truly?"</p>
    
    <p>Smiling, Pippin leaned 
        in for another kiss, slower this time, filled with more love than lust. Merry 
        joined in wholeheartedly this time, and they lingered over it, rediscovering 
        long-missed tastes and textures. Their hands tangled in each other's hair, 
        then moved lower, only to stop suddenly as they both laughed.</p>
    
    <p>Pippin snickered down 
        at Merry. "There is no romantic way out of mail, I don't think." He sat back, 
        pulling the surcoat over his head.</p>
    
    <p>"I think it's to stop 
        you fooling about on duty," Merry informed him sardonically. "No, wait."</p>
    
    <p>Pippin stopped, hands 
        on his mailshirt. "What?"</p>
    
    <p>Merry sat up, leaving 
        Pippin to kneel over his legs, and reached for the shirt himself. Running 
        his fingers down the closely-knit links, he slid his thumbs under the bottom 
        edge and raised his hands, gathering the mail as he went, his eyes never leaving 
        Pippin's.</p>
    
    <p>Pippin raised his arms 
        automatically as Merry slid his hands through the shirt's neck to caress his 
        face, protecting his hair from the chain as he slid it off.</p>
    
    <p>"I take it back," Pippin 
        managed after a moment. Merry grinned. Nevertheless, they resumed peeling 
        off their layers of armour with more alacrity than seduction. Somehow, it 
        became a contest in getting the other one's clothing off first, which consequently 
        resulted in the process taking twice as long as it should have and the royal 
        emblems of Gondor and Rohan lying strewn about the grass beside the two now 
        madly giggling hobbits.</p>
    
    <p>The hilarity changed to 
        deeper joy as they lay back in each other's arms, hands now freely roaming 
        over sun-warmed, familiar flesh.</p>
    
    <p>They kissed again, sucking 
        at each other's lips, the sensations rushing through their bodies, intensified 
        at every point they met.</p>
    
    <p>Pippin sighed happily 
        and pulled at Merry's bottom lip with his teeth, licking inside it, encouraging 
        Merry's tongue back into his own mouth. Merry's hands ran down his sides and 
        onto his back, one settling in at the base of his spine, caressing lightly, 
        forcing a small cry from Pippin as his hips twitched forward. In answer, he 
        brought his own hands up to scour the rough pads of his thumbs over Merry's 
        nipples, making him groan and arch up as much as he was able. He shifted, 
        and Pippin rolled to one side, giving them both greater freedom of movement. 
    </p>
    
    <p>After so long apart, they 
        had little patience for the finer complexities of lovemaking. That could come 
        later in the day, or the week. For this time, they swiftly reached the never-forgotten 
        rhythm that best pleased them both, thrusting into each other's sweat-slicked 
        flesh with increasing urgency, feeling out the most sensitive spots on their 
        lover, rushing toward a climax that hit with the force of a sword-stroke, 
        piercing them through with delight. They cried out one last time and lay still, 
        panting in the grass. Pippin collapsed to lay half on Merry, the closeness 
        more important than any heat, and they remained there for some time in silence.</p>
    
    <p>Eventually, Merry stirred 
        underneath him. "Are we expected for anything other than meals?"</p>
    
    <p>Pippin shrugged and squirmed 
        closer yet. "Not that I know of."</p>
    
    <p>"Good." Merry sounded 
        half-asleep already; loving often took him like that.</p>
    
    <p>"Go to sleep, old gaffer," 
        Pippin teased him. "Have to keep your strength up."</p>
    
    <p>Merry smacked him smartly 
        on the arse. "I'll show you old," he affirmed around a yawn, and glared at 
        Pippin even as his eyes drifted closed. "Soon as I wake up," he vowed. </p>
    
    <p>Pippin watched him fondly 
        and caressed his shoulder and arm with simple possessive joy. "I look forward 
        to it," he told his sleeping lover, and settled in to wait. "Old, and older, 
        and oldest."</p>

  content: "I let us both back into the office, and flicked on the lights. The bulb blew out. It does that \r\n\
    a lot. I sighed, and shut the door behind us, leaving stripes of golden autumn light \r\n\
    pouring through the blinds, interweaving with shadows on the floor and walls.\r\n\
    I drew out a seat in front of my desk for the young woman. She blinked at me in \r\n\
    confusion for a second before she said, \"Oh,\" and sat. I walked around the desk, leaving \r\n\
    my duster on, and sat down.\r\n\
    \"All right,\" I said. \"If you want my protection, I want a few things from you first.\"\r\n\
    She pushed back her asphalt-colored hair with one hand and gave me a look of pure \r\n\
    calculation. Then she simply crossed her legs, so that the cut of her dress left one pale leg \r\n\
    bare to mid-thigh. A subtle motion of her back thrust out her young, firm breasts, so that \r\n\
    their tips pressed visibly against the fabric. \"Of course, Mr. Dresden. I'm sure we can do \r\n\
    business.\" The look she gave me was direct, sensual, and willing.\r\n\
    Nipple erection on command\xE2\x80\x94now that's method acting. Oh, she was pretty enough, I \r\n\
    suppose. Any adolescent male would have been drooling and hurling himself at her, but \r\n\
    I'd seen acts a lot better. I rolled my eyes. \"That's not what I meant.\"\r\n\
    Her sex-kitten look faltered. \"It \xE2\x80\xA6 it isn't?\" She frowned at me, eyes scanning me again, \r\n\
    reassessing me. \"Is it \xE2\x80\xA6 are you \xE2\x80\xA6 ?\"\r\n\
    \"No,\" I said. \"I'm not gay. But I'm not buying what you're selling. You haven't even told \r\n\
    me your name, but you're willing to spread your legs for me? No thanks. Hell's Bells, \r\n\
    haven't you ever heard of AIDS? Herpes?\"\r\n\
    Her face went white, and she pressed her lips together until they were white, too. \"All \r\n\
    right, then,\" she said. \"What do you want from me?\"\r\n\
    \"Answers,\" I told her, jabbing a finger at her. \"And don't try lying to me. It won't do you \r\n\
    any good.\" Which was only a marginal lie, in itself. Being a wizard doesn't make you a \r\n\
    walking lie detector, and I wasn't going to try a soulgaze on her to find out if she was \r\n\
    sincere\xE2\x80\x94it wasn't worth it. But another great thing about being a wizard is that people \r\n\
    attribute just about anything you do to your vast and unknowable powers. Granted, it only \r\n\
    works with those who know enough to believe in wizards, but not enough to understand \r\n\
    our limits\xE2\x80\x94the rest of the world, the regular people who think magic is just a joke, just \r\n\
    look at you like someone is going to stuff you into a little white coat any second now.\r\n\
    She licked her lips, a nervous gesture, not a sexy one. \"All right,\" she said. \"What do you \r\n\
    want to know?\"\r\n\
    \"Your name, for starters.\"\r\n\
    She let out a harsh laugh. \"You think I'm going to give you that, wizard?\"\r\n\
    Point. Serious spell-slingers like me could do an awful lot with a person's name, given by \r\n\
    their own lips. \"All right, then. What do I call you?\"\r\n\
    She didn't bother to cover her leg again. A rather pretty leg, actually, with a tattoo of \r\n\
    some kind encircling her ankle. I tried not to notice. \"Lydia,\" she said. \"Call me Lydia.\"\r\n\
    \"Okay, Lydia. You're a practitioner of the Art. Tell me about that.\"\r\n\
    \"It doesn't have anything to do with what I want from you, Mr. Dresden,\" she said. She \r\n\
    swallowed, her anger fading. \"Please. I need your help.\"\r\n\
    \"All right, all right,\" I said. \"What kind of help do you need? If you're into some kind of \r\n\
    gang-related trouble, I'm going to recommend that you head for the police. I'm not a \r\n\
    bodyguard.\"\r\n\
    She shivered, and hugged herself with her arms. \"No, nothing like that. It's not my body \r\n\
    I'm worried about.\"\r\n\
    That made me frown.\r\n\
    She closed her eyes and drew in a breath. \"I need a talisman,\" she said. \"Something to \r\n\
    protect me from a hostile spirit.\"\r\n\
    That made me sit up and take notice, metaphorically speaking. With the city flying into \r\n\
    spiritual chaos as it was, I had no trouble believing that a girl gifted with magical talent \r\n\
    might be experiencing some bad phenomena. Ghosts and spooks are drawn to the \r\n\
    magically gifted. \"What kind of spirit?\"\r\n\
    Her eyes shifted left and right, never looking at me. \"I can't really say, Mr. Dresden. It's \r\n\
    powerful and it wants to hurt me. They \xE2\x80\xA6 they told me you could make something that \r\n\
    would keep me safe.\"\r\n\
    True, in point of fact. Around my left wrist at that very moment was a talisman made \r\n\
    from a dead man's shroud, blessed silver, and a number of other, more difficult to come \r\n\
    by ingredients. \"Maybe,\" I told her. \"That depends on why you're in danger, and why you \r\n\
    feel you need protection.\"\r\n\
    \"I c-can't tell you that,\" she said. Her pale face pinched into an expression of worry\xE2\x80\x94real \r\n\
    worry, the kind that makes you look older, uglier. The way she hugged herself made her \r\n\
    look smaller, more frail. \"Please, I just need your help.\"\r\n\
    I sighed, and rubbed at one eyebrow with my thumb. My first rampant instincts were to \r\n\
    give her a cup of hot chocolate, put a blanket around her shoulders, tell her everything \r\n\
    would be all right and strap my talisman onto her wrist. I tried to rein those in, though. \r\n\
    Down, Quixote. I still knew nothing about her situation, or what she needed protection \r\n\
    from\xE2\x80\x94for all I knew, she was trying to stave off an avenging angel coming after her in \r\n\
    retribution for some act so vile that it stirred the Powers that be to take immediate action. \r\n\
    Even vanilla ghosts sometimes come back to haunt someone for a darned good reason.\r\n\
    \"Look, Lydia. I don't like to get involved in anything without knowing something about \r\n\
    what's going on.\" Which hadn't slowed me down before, I noted. \"Unless you can tell me \r\n\
    a little bit about your situation, convince me that you are in legitimate need of protection, \r\n\
    I won't be able to help you.\"\r\n\
    She bowed her head, her asphalt hair falling across her face for a long minute. Then she \r\n\
    drew in a breath and asked, \"Do you know what Cassandra's Tears is, Mr. Dresden?\"\r\n\
    \"Prophetic condition,\" I said. \"The person in question has random seizures\xE2\x80\x94visions of \r\n\
    the future, but they're always couched in terms of conditions that make explanation of the \r\n\
    dreams seem unbelievable. Doctors mistake it for epilepsy in children, sometimes, and \r\n\
    prescribe a bunch of different drugs for it. Pretty accurate prophecy, as it goes, but no one \r\n\
    ever buys into it. Some people call it a gift.\"\r\n\
    \"I'm not one of them,\" she whispered. \"You don't know how horrible it is. To see \r\n\
    something about to happen and to try to change it, only to have no one believe you.\"\r\n\
    I studied her for a minute in silence, listening to the clock on my wall count down the \r\n\
    seconds. \"All right,\" I said. \"You say that you have this gift. I guess you want me to \r\n\
    believe that one of your visions warned you about an evil spirit coming after you?\"\r\n\
    \"Not one,\" she said. \"Three. Three, Mr. Dresden. I only got one vision when they tried to \r\n\
    kill the President. I got two for that disaster at NASA, and for the earthquake in Laos. I've \r\n\
    never had three before. Never had something appear so clearly \xE2\x80\xA6\"\r\n\
    I closed my eyes to think about this. Again, my instincts told me to help the girl, smash \r\n\
    the bad ghost or whatever, and walk off into the sunset. If she was indeed afflicted with \r\n\
    Cassandra's Tears, my actions could do more than save her life. My faith could change it \r\n\
    for the better.\r\n\
    On the other hand, I'd been played for a sucker before. The girl was obviously a \r\n\
    competent actress. She had shifted smoothly to the role of willing seductress, when she \r\n\
    thought I had been asking for sex in payment. That she would immediately make that \r\n\
    conclusion based on my own fairly neutral statement said something about her, all by \r\n\
    itself. This wasn't a girl who was used to playing things fair and square. Unless I was \r\n\
    grossly misreading her, she had bartered sex for goods and services before\xE2\x80\x94and she was \r\n\
    awfully young to be so jaded about the entire matter.\r\n\
    The entire Cassandra's Tears angle was a perfect scam, and people had used it before, \r\n\
    among the circles of the magically endowed. The story required no proof, no \r\n\
    performance on the part of the person running the scam. All she would need would be a \r\n\
    smidgen of talent to give her the right aura, maybe enough kinetomancy to tilt the dice a \r\n\
    little on their way down. Then she could make up whatever story she wanted about her \r\n\
    supposed prophetic gifts, put on a little-girl-lost act, and head straight for the local \r\n\
    dummy, Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden.\r\n\
    I opened my eyes to find her watching me. \"Of course,\" she said. \"I could be lying. \r\n\
    Cassandra's Tears can't be analyzed or observed. I could be using it as an excuse to \r\n\
    provide a reasonable explanation why you should help a lady in distress.\"\r\n\
    \"That's pretty much what's going through my mind, Lydia, yeah. You could just be a \r\n\
    small-time witch who stirred up the wrong demon and is looking for a way out.\"\r\n\
    She spread her hands. \"All I can tell you is that I'm not. I know that something's coming. \r\n\
    I don't know what, and I don't know why or how. I just know what I see.\"\r\n\
    \"Which is?\"\r\n\
    \"Fire,\" she whispered. \"Wind. I see dark things and a dark war. I see my death coming for \r\n\
    me, out of the spirit world. And I see you at the middle of it all. You're the beginning, the \r\n\
    end of it. You're the one who can make the path go different ways.\"\r\n\
    \"That's your vision? Iowa has less corn.\"\r\n\
    She turned her face away. \"I see what I see.\"\r\n\
    Standard carny procedure. Flatter the ego of the mark, draw him in, get him good and \r\n\
    hooked, and fleece him for everything he's got. Sheesh, I thought, someone else trying to \r\n\
    get something out of me. My reputation must be growing.\r\n\
    Still, there was no sense in being rude. \"Look, Lydia. I think maybe you're just \r\n\
    overreacting, here. Why don't we meet again in a couple of days, and we'll see if you still \r\n\
    think you need my help.\"\r\n\
    She didn't answer me. Her shoulders just slumped forward and her face went slack with \r\n\
    defeat. She closed her eyes, and I felt a nagging sensation of doubt tug at me. I had the \r\n\
    uncomfortable impression that she wasn't acting.\r\n\
    \"All right,\" she said, softly. \"I'm sorry to have kept you late.\" She got up and started \r\n\
    walking toward the door of my office.\r\n\
    My better judgement propelled me up out of my chair and across the room. We reached \r\n\
    the door at the same time.\r\n\
    \"Wait a minute,\" I said. I unbound the talisman from my arm, feeling the silent pop of \r\n\
    energy as the knot came undone. Then I took her left wrist and turned her hand over to tie \r\n\
    the talisman onto her. There were pale scars on her arm\xE2\x80\x94the vertical kind that run along \r\n\
    the big veins. The ones you get when you're really serious about killing yourself. They \r\n\
    were old and faded. She must have gotten them when she was \xE2\x80\xA6 what? Ten years old? \r\n\
    Younger?\r\n\
    I shuddered and secured the little braid of musty cloth and silver chain about her wrist, \r\n\
    willing enough energy into it to close the circle once the knot was tied. When I finished, I \r\n\
    touched her forearm lightly. I could just feel the talisman's power, a tingling sensation \r\n\
    that hovered a half-inch off of her skin.\r\n\
    \"Faith magic works best against spirits,\" I said quietly. \"If you're worried, get to a church. \r\n\
    Spirits are strongest just after the sun goes down, around the witching hour, and again \r\n\
    just before the sun comes up. Go to Saint Mary of the Angels. It's a church at the corner \r\n\
    of Bloomingdale and Wood, down by Wicker Park. It's huge, you can't miss it. Go around \r\n\
    to the delivery door and ring the bell. Talk to Father Forthill. Tell him that Michael's \r\n\
    friend said that you need a safe place to stay for a while.\"\r\n\
    She only stared at me, her mouth open. Tears formed in her eyes. \"You believe me,\" she \r\n\
    said. \"You believe me.\"\r\n\
    I shrugged, uncomfortable. \"Maybe. Maybe not. But things have been bad, the past few \r\n\
    weeks, and I would rather not have you on my conscience. You'd better hurry. It's going \r\n\
    to be sundown soon.\" I pressed some bills into her hand and said, \"Take a cab. Saint \r\n\
    Mary of the Angels. Father Forthill. Michael's friend sent you.\"\r\n\
    \"Thank you,\" she said. \"Oh, God. Thank you, Mr. Dresden.\" She seized my hand in both \r\n\
    of hers and pressed a tearstained kiss to my knuckles. Her fingers were cold and her lips \r\n\
    too hot. Then she vanished out the door.\r\n\
    I shut it behind her and shook my head. \"Harry, you idiot. Your one decent talisman that \r\n\
    would protect you against ghosts and you just gave it away. She's probably a plant. They \r\n\
    probably sent her to you just to get the talisman off you, so that they can eat you up the \r\n\
    next time you go spoil their fun.\" I glared down at my hand, where the warmth of Lydia's \r\n\
    kiss and the dampness of her tears still lingered. Then I sighed, and walked to the cabinet \r\n\
    where I kept fifty or sixty spare light-bulbs on hand, and replaced the one that had burned \r\n\
    out.\r\n\
    The phone rang. I got down off my chair and answered it sourly. \"Dresden.\"\r\n\
    There was silence and scratchy static on the other end of the line.\r\n\
    \"Dresden,\" I repeated.\r\n\
    The silence stretched on, and something about it made the hairs on the back of my neck \r\n\
    stand up. There was a quality to it that is difficult to describe. Like something waiting. \r\n\
    Gloating. The static crackled louder, and I thought I could hear voices underneath it, \r\n\
    voices speaking in low, cruel tones. I glanced at the door, after the departed Lydia. \"Who \r\n\
    is this?\"\r\n\
    \"Soon,\" whispered a voice. \"Soon, Dresden. We will see one another again.\"\r\n\
    \"Who is this?\" I repeated, feeling a little silly.\r\n\
    The line went dead.\r\n\
    I stared at the phone before hanging it up, then ran my hand back through my hair. A chill \r\n\
    crawled neatly down my spine and took up residence somewhere a little lower than my \r\n\
    stomach. \"All right, then,\" I said, my own voice a little too loud in the office. \"Thank God \r\n\
    that wasn't too creepy or anything.\"\r\n\
    The antique radio on the shelf beside the coffee machine hissed and squalled to life and I \r\n\
    almost jumped out of my shoes. I whirled to face it in a fury, hands clenched.\r\n\
    \"Harry?\" said a voice on the radio. \"Hey, Harry, is this thing working?\"\r\n\
    I tried to calm my pounding heart, and focused enough will on the radio to let my voice \r\n\
    carry through. \"Yeah, Bob. It's me.\"\r\n\
    \"Thank the stars,\" Bob said. \"You said you wanted to know if I found out anything else \r\n\
    ghostly going on.\"\r\n\
    \"Yeah, yeah, go ahead.\"\r\n\
    The radio hissed and crackled with static\xE2\x80\x94spiritual interference, not physical. The radio \r\n\
    wasn't set up to receive AM/FM any more. Bob's voice was garbled, but I could \r\n\
    understand it. \"My contact came through. Cook County Hospital, tonight. Someone's \r\n\
    stirred up Agatha Hagglethorn. This is a bad one, Harry. She is one mean old biddy.\"\r\n\
    Bob gave me the rundown on Agatha Hagglethorn's grisly and tragic death, and her most \r\n\
    likely target at the hospital. I glanced down at my bare left wrist, and abruptly felt naked. \r\n\
    \"All right,\" I said. \"I'm on it. Thanks, Bob.\"\r\n\
    The radio squalled and went silent, and I dashed out the door. Sundown would come in \r\n\
    less than twenty minutes, rush hour had been going for a while now, and if I wasn't at \r\n\
    Cook County by the time it got dark, all kinds of bad things could happen.\r\n\
    I flew out the front door, the sack of ghost dust heavy in my pocket, and all but slammed \r\n\
    into Michael, tall and broad, toting a huge athletic bag over his shoulder, which I knew \r\n\
    would contain nothing but Amoracchius and his white cloak.\r\n\
    \"Michael!\" I burst out. \"How did you get here?\"\r\n\
    His honest face split into a wide smile. \"When there is a need, He sees to it that I am \r\n\
    there.\"\r\n\
    \"Wow,\" I said. \"You're kidding.\"\r\n\
    \"No,\" he said, his voice earnest. Then he paused. \"Of course, you've gotten in touch with \r\n\
    me every night for the past two weeks. Tonight, I just thought I'd save Him the trouble of \r\n\
    arranging coincidence, so I came on over as soon as I got off work.\" He fell into step \r\n\
    beside me and we both got into the Blue Beetle\xE2\x80\x94he got in the red door. I got in the white \r\n\
    one, and we peered out over the grey hood as I pulled the old VW into traffic.\r\n\
    And that was how we ended up doing battle in the nursery at Cook County.\r\n\
    Anyway, you see what I mean about a day being fairly normal before it falls all to pieces. \r\n\
    Oh, well. Maybe it hadn't been all that normal. As we took off into traffic and I gave the \r\n\
    Beetle all the gas it could take, I got that sinking feeling that my life was about to get \r\n\
    hectic again."

    Section 19: In Flight Conversation<p>**************************************************************************** ********************************************************************</p>
    <p>From the bird's-eye view of the ocean, Moya looked like a funky island without any beaches. She was a little gold mountain struggling alone in the great expanse of water. It was a humbling picture, and one that John had not thought about in a very long time. It reminded him of when he was a kid, looking up at the stars and feeling both the weight and awe of the vastness of the universe, wondering where he, John Robert Crichton, fit into the grand scheme of things.</p>
    <p>Thinking about it now as the familiar thrill of flight washed through him, John suddenly felt very glad and very thankful to be alive. The bigger mystery of life had gotten lost somewhere in the fight for survival, but now, another crisis averted, John was going to marry Aeryn and they were going to have a baby. That was a miracle if there ever was one.</p>
    <p>And as an added bonus, he got to fly the prowler. With a grin of sudden delight, John put his foot to the floor and whipped her into a barrel roll as he hadn't done in years. Like riding a bike, and it never got old.</p>
    <p>"Whoa there, hot shot!" Jack called over the comm with a smile in his voice. "Feeling the air a bit?"</p>
    <p>"Like life under my wings!" John replied. "Ain't nothing better than a clear horizon for a little flying. How are you doing over there?"</p>
    <p>"Good." There was a pause, then, "Does this thing corkscrew?"</p>
    <p>John couldn't help but smile. "Never done it in atmosphere."</p>
    <p>"Designed for space?"</p>
    <p>"Designed to dive head first into the atmosphere," John replied. To the hammond side, he saw his module flying in lazy circles. Battered, beat up, and decked out in Moya's gold, she was a far sight different from the ship he had once hoped to wow the world with. "I was trying to prove that you could use the Earth's gravity to reach an accelerated - "</p>
    <p>"Wait, wait, wait," Jack interrupted him with a sigh. "TMI. Skip the details."</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"Simple words for simple minds," Jack clarified. "None of this scientist mumbo-jumbo. You sound just like Carter."</p>
    <p>John smiled and re-explained. "I was trying go fast enough to get out of our solar system using the Earth's gravity as a power source."</p>
    <p>"See that wasn't so hard," Jack sounded satisfied. "So how did you end up out here?"</p>
    <p>"What is this? Twenty questions?"</p>
    <p>"It's a breadbox, and I don't see any license plates out here for the alphabet game."</p>
    <p>John shook his head to himself. He had to give the man credit for style - that and the random Earth reference that felt so good to hear. "During the experiment I accidentally opened a wormhole. Got dumped in the Uncharted Territories. Moya picked me up during their prison break. You?"</p>
    <p>"The stargate was found in Egypt in the 1920's. Took till Carter and Daniel were born and geniuses for the Air Force to get it to work. Me and Daniel were on the first mission through. Met the bad guys of the universe, our universe anyway, pissed them off, and been fighting ever since."</p>
    <p>"Sounds like fun," John commented dryly though it sounded anything but.</p>
    <p>"Oh, you know, it has its perks," said Jack lightly. "We get to save the world a lot. Like Buffy really, except with aliens. And that sounds just as freaky when I say it like that." John laughed at that and agreed. "So," Jack went on, "my question. What are your intentions toward Aeryn?"</p>
    <p>For the second time, John could only splutter, "What?"</p>
    <p>"Your intentions," Jack enunciated carefully, having fun with it. "I heard you were getting married and since I doubt her father has had a chance to grill you . . ."</p>
    <p>"You thought you'd do it," John finished. "We're having a baby, if that answers your question."</p>
    <p>"A baby?" Jack repeated, and John wasn't sure if he was shocked or not. "That's great!" he finally said. "Congratulations. It's not a shotgun wedding, is it?" he asked playfully.</p>
    <p>"Nah, just a long time coming," John replied, glad of the response. Somehow, over the course of the conversation, Jack had not only gotten firmly into the friend category, but had also taken up residence.</p>
    <p>"How long have you been together?"</p>
    <p>"Define together."</p>
    <p>"That bad?"</p>
    <p>"Till about, I don't know, a month ago. What about you? You married?"</p>
    <p>"Divorced," Jack answered shortly.</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry," said John, feeling bad now that he had asked.</p>
    <p>"You didn't know," Jack seemed to shrug. "Anyway it was a long time ago. So D'argo said you fish?"</p>
    <p>No more questions about family, John gathered as he answered in the affirmative. He wondered what had happened as they argued over the merits of Minnesota and Maine and any number of other fishing spots either had been to. But then again, no family was without its tragedies, on Earth or in this end of the galaxy. So they talked about fishing spots and bass and trout and the best lures to use and how unappreciative their friends were about the best sport in the world.</p>
    <p>"He just glowered at me - I mean really glowered - the next time I asked him if he wanted to go," Jack was telling him about Teal'c's reaction to relaxing in a boat. "I think it took him the whole day just to forgive me for asking."</p>
    <p>John laughed. "That's about what happened to me when I tried to take D with me on Earth. The only reason he came with me the second time was so we could talk. He wouldn't touch the pole though. Told me he gladly slave away on a farm but wouldn't mindlessly wait for fish to bite."</p>
    <p>"D'argo farm?" asked Jack, disbelievingly.</p>
    <p>"Yeah. You wouldn't think it to look at him," John thought fondly of his friend and the gentle side of him that was so different from the warrior.</p>
    <p>"So Moya was a prison ship?" Jack delicately put forth the question.</p>
    <p>"Sing Sing in space," John replied. "I hope that doesn't make you think any less of us," he added. Their own reception on Earth had become even colder when the suits had found out about that little fact.</p>
    <p>"I'll admit I was concerned for a while. Rygel said he used to be king of his planet or something."</p>
    <p>"He gave you the speech, didn't he?" John said with a sympathetic wince.</p>
    <p>"Six hundred billion people?"</p>
    <p>"That'd be the one."</p>
    <p>"You know he was the only one who told us what he was in for."</p>
    <p>"So now you want to know about the rest of us?" John asked with a half smile. "Well D'argo is Moya's only other original prisoner. He was locked up for a murder he didn't commit."</p>
    <p>"If he was innocent why did he completely avoid the question?"</p>
    <p>John was silent for a moment, wondering if he should say. "Because it was his wife's murder."</p>
    <p>"That's rough," said Jack quietly.</p>
    <p>"Yeah." But not just rough, horrible. John remembered the feeling of utter loss when Aeryn had fallen to death for a time. He had been lucky and gotten her back, but D'argo had no such miracle awaiting him. Lo'la was gone forever. "My question, right?" John needed to turn the depressing thoughts away.</p>
    <p>"Shoot," said Jack, the whimsical note back in his voice.</p>
    <p>"Who won the Super Bowl in your universe?"</p>
    <p>"Super Bowl?" Jack sounded offended. "Forget football. Now hockey, that's a sport."</p>
    <p>Balance achieved once more, John quickly fell into the friendly argument until Pilot called them home.</p>

    <p>The wind breezing over the plains 
        of Rohan whips around Edoras on its high hill, and his cloak and robes billow 
        around him unceasingly. His hair streams out silver-white in the sun, gleaming 
        brighter than Meduseld's golden roof behind us.</p>
    
    <p>I still search for signs of the 
        Gandalf that was -- Mithrandir, the Grey Pilgrim, hair the colour of stormclouds 
        and experience mapped in his face and hands. But as he looks out over the 
        plains, his face is hidden from me, and the white wizard at my side could 
        as easily be Saruman. I do not know this new, white wizard as well as I knew 
        the grey. Saruman wore the colour as both badge and shield, keeping from him 
        the grit and the sweat of humanity. I cannot think of him drinking beer in 
        a tavern, muddy feet on a stool, blowing many-shaped smoke rings. Will his 
        successor? </p>
    
    <p>Then he sighs and shakes his head, 
        turns from his contemplation, and he could be no-one else. The wry humour 
        that twists his mouth, the fondness and life twinkling in those still-grey 
        eyes -- this is my beloved friend.</p>
    
    <p>"North, you said?"</p>
    
    <p>I nod, and point out Eomer's path 
        to him, near as I can make it from our vantage point. "But exiled or not, 
        I think it likely he will keep to the trails of orcs and wild men. He did 
        not strike me as one to flee from a fight." </p>
    
    <p>He nods in return and squeezes 
        my shoulder. His hand stays there as our eyes search for any hint of the exiles, 
        though even Legolas could not find them now. But perhaps this new Gandalf, 
        the white wizard... He has used more power openly on this day than ever I 
        have known him to before. I think, perhaps, the last and greatest days of 
        his task are coming. This war with Sauron must end soon, and he will either 
        fall or return whence he came. Almost, I could wish this conflict would continue, 
        so long as he would remain with us. With me. I do not want to lose him again.</p>
    
    <p>Yet he returned. I close my eyes 
        to remember the moment, the joy that froze me in my tracks. Not the same as 
        before, but he is with us. Perhaps. We have been on the move since the grey 
        dawn of morning, no time for comfort, and indeed I do not even know if this 
        new Gandalf has need of any. </p>
    
    <p>I open my eyes to find him looking 
        at me. His brow creases as if in pain, a look I am familiar with. Often the 
        same look would chide me when I had missed something painfully obvious. I 
        am tempted to laugh; I hold it in, but my lips still curl. No matter how many 
        times he is sent back to us, he will still be Gandalf. The creases of his 
        face may not show all his years, but that does not mean those times have been 
        erased. He could appear as young as the children playing in the city, and 
        that would not change who he is. </p>
    
    <p>I was raised in the house of Elrond; 
        I know the truth of the Istari. Had I become acquainted with Saruman as a 
        child, perhaps that knowledge would have overawed me, but learning the ways 
        of Mithrandir only made me curious, hungering for more of his knowledge and 
        company. Much of what I learned of the world, I can trace to his wisdom. Or 
        to his foolishness.</p>
    
    <p>He lifts his hand to hail one of 
        Theoden's guards, and I miss its presence almost immediately. The man hurries 
        over to us, bowing before the great wizard, and I hide my smile at what my 
        friend would undoubtedly call senseless flattery, given this same man denied 
        us entrance earlier, with little courtesy.</p>
    
    <p>"Which villages to the north still 
        stand?"</p>
    
    <p>Too few, as it happens. The wild 
        men have done their master's work well. Yet fewer of the Rohirrim have died 
        than I would expect. He dismisses the guard and we are on our own once again. 
        He sighs. "How far Saruman has fallen." His voice is deep and weary, and I 
        curl my hand around the one on his staff, taking the other in a strong grip.</p>
    
    <p>"We will not fail. We must not."</p>
    
    <p>He smiles at me, and his smile 
        is the same I remember from childhood, my mentor approving of some new skill 
        learned, and from my adulthood, my dearest friend sharing confidences or a 
        blanket. And that is a comfort we've not had in too long.</p>
    
    <p>It was not a smile I got when first 
        I stroked him as a lover, I remember; it was a laugh. Never have I been refused 
        so courteously! But as Lord Elrond may attest, I am a stubborn suitor. A child 
        I might be next to one of the Maiar, older than the world, but was Elu Thingol 
        any less so to Melian? Yet I stand as proof of that union, proof that whatever 
        heart may beat in their chest, their blood can still be stirred as ours. But 
        in these darkened days, the delight of men must give way to necessity. I stroke 
        his hand where I hold it, the only pleasure we can take at this moment.</p>
    
    <p>"We will prevail," he agrees, but 
        I know he has not seen it. He speaks from the same hope and fear that I do. 
        We can allow no other outcome here, not even in our thoughts.</p>
    
    <p>He lays a hand on my cheek for 
        a moment, then turns to go. I follow him to the stables, unwilling to part 
        sooner than we must. So little time since I thought him dead, and all our 
        times since then spent in company; these few moments are the nearest we have 
        come to quiet conversation, and time is too precious to squander on the confirmation 
        of his being my body and heart would have. Instead, I will trust to him as 
        I always have, and fight for him and with him.</p>
    
    <p>I have no kingdom, and he would 
        tell me to keep my sword for my own use. War is no time for the giving of 
        hearts. My body he may have again, if fate is good, but that will wait. All 
        I can offer him in these hours are my allegiance and my promise: Rohan's defences 
        will hold until his return.</p>
    
    <p>And, I promise him silently as 
        he rides off, lit by his own light as well as that of the sun, so will I.</p>

    <p>****************** Seven Swans ********************</p>\n\
    <p>\"There they are,\" Jack whispered. He passed the binoculars to Teal'c who lay beside him behind the bushes on the top of a little hillock overlooking a valley where twenty jaffa were putting together a machine of some sort. He needed to get Carter to take a look at this. Since there was so little cover she had stayed with Daniel out of sight further down the slope.</p>\n\
    <p>\"They are indeed Anubis's Jaffa,\" said Teal'c a note above a whisper. \"And to the east there are another several more in the trees.\" He handed the binoculars back for Jack to take a look. The colonel counted eight standing around. From their positions he guessed they were guarding something. The intel they had received from the tok'ra had been incomplete, as usual, and had only warned them about a possible weapon being built. But what Jack couldn't figure out was why here in this valley? They were miles away from the gate and the valley wasn't that great a spot for an ambush. Taking one last sweep of the activity below, Jack crawled back from the edge and signaled for Carter to take his place while he joined Daniel below.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How's it look?\" the archeologist asked quietly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ten working on that weapon, another ten standing guard, and eight off in the trees to the east,\" Jack told him. \"We'll see what Carter makes of what their building, then get back to the 'gate.\" He looked at his watch; it was almost four o'clock on Earth.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you think the tok'ra were right about this being a staging ground?\" Daniel asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Maybe,\" said Jack with a shrug. He always took what the tok'ra told them with about a barrel of salt. \"They're up to something alright. But I'm not sure what. For the moment it looks pretty low key.\" He cast his eye about their six but there was no movement. Above them, Carter and Teal'c were still checking out the scene.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sir,\" Carter hissed suddenly, \"we've got two jaffa heading our way.\" She and Teal'c quickly slithered away from the edge and back down the slope until they were crouching beside Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How far away are they?\" asked Jack, immediately turning in his crouch to face the hill.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Approximately one hundred yards,\" said Teal'c. \"I do not believe they saw us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did you see enough?\" Jack turned to Carter.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, sir,\" his major replied. \"And I think we have time to set up the camera.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do it,\" Jack ordered. \"Daniel, Teal'c start back for the gate. We'll be right behind you.\" The two men nodded, Daniel shouldered his pack, and they started off. Carter quickly went to work, wriggling back to the cover at the top of the hill with the video equipment while Jack kept watch beside her. The two jaffa drew closer, probably heading for the gate themselves. They would be hard pressed to get there ahead of them. But soon Carter finished, and with a quick confirmatory nod, they too got out of there as fast as they could.</p>\n\
    <p>The way back to the 'gate was grassy with stunted trees and bushes like the ones scattered about their observatory. Jack hoped to make it back to the trees about half a mile away before the jaffa caught sight of them but he doubted they would make it. And the sudden shout and blast of staff fire just proved him right. Jack hated it when he was right like this. He swore silently as he and Carter broke into a run. Ahead of them, Teal'c and Daniel returned fire until they joined them in the woods in an all out sprint to the gate. The jaffa were slowed down, though not by much, by their clunky armor.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So much for a nice easy recon mission before Christmas,\" Jack panted to Carter as trees brushed past and fallen logs tried to grab their feet. Teal'c led them off the beaten path in an effort, trying to find a spot they could hide in so they could double back, but the trees were too small for them so they just ran. By the time they rejoined the path, Jack felt like his lungs were going to burst. He checked behind them for the jaffa who had been slowed a little but were nonetheless still there. A few minutes later, they burst into the 'gate clearing. Daniel in front ran and dialed home while the rest of them made for the wormhole that blossomed in the stone ring. Staff fire peppered the ground beneath their feet but Jack ignored it in favor of speed. He was the last the dive through the gate, whoosh through the wormhole, and land in a barrel roll on the ramp on the other side, shouting, \"Close the iris!\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack took a moment to catch his breath from the run before pulling himself to his feet amid the hustle of armed marines and the blaring claxons. Daniel, Carter, Teal'c, all were winded but alive and accounted for. Didn't look like anyone was hurt. In the control room, General Hammond watched gravely so Jack threw him a cheery if a bit sardonic smile.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Welcome back, SG-1,\" said Hammond. \"We'll debrief in one hour.\" Jack glanced at his watch. Four twenty-nine blinked back at him. One hour for the post-mission, one for the briefing, one and a half for the paperwork, two to get to the airport and pick up Xander an hour late. Great. Jack reminded himself for the millionth time to never say yes to a quick mission ever again. And he really needed to stop throwing himself through the 'gate, he thought as his shoulder protested movement and his knees throbbed from where they'd hit the ramp, not to mention the run.</p>\n\
    <p>The next hour passed in the blur of the well familiar. No doc, no snakes in our heads, yes General, something is going on there. Jack listened as Carter explained that she thought the jaffa had been building a platform for something much bigger, though again she didn't know what it was exactly. Hopefully the video would tell them more \xE2\x80\x93 if it wasn't discovered and destroyed. There really wasn't much more to add. Jack could practically feel the freedom of the holiday like a little kid in school as the briefing drew ever closer to being dismissed. And then, right after Hammond wished them all a good break and reminded them about the Christmas party, he said those fateful words, \"Colonel, could you stay a moment?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Of course, sir,\" Jack stopped and sat back down in his chair with a forced smile. With all due respect, he could have killed his CO.</p>\n\
    <p>********************</p>\n\
    <p>Xander glanced at the time on his cell phone again only to see that two minutes had passed since the last time he had checked. The rest of the passengers from his plane had already deserted the baggage claim, leaving him alone with his duffel on a bracket of chairs. He wasn't sure what felt worse, sitting alone feeling forgotten or the impatience and nervous energy that came from waiting. Jack's cell was turned off and only his machine was answering at home leaving Xander wondering where the hell he was. And oddly, beneath the slight hurt, his greatest fear was that something had eaten Jack in the parking lot.</p>\n\
    <p>Where was he? He was forty minutes late and counting. Not showing was something that Xander would have expected of his own parents but not Jack. Jack was better than that, and this small shattering of expectation only served to remind Xander of how little they really knew each other. Six months, most of that spent apart with only two real visits and a scattering of phone calls. And now a few more days to try and get to know each other.  Though after Thanksgiving, he wondered if they ever really would.</p>\n\
    <p>The woosh of the sliding doors opening grabbed his attention, but it wasn't Jack who walked through. Had he forgotten? Xander didn't think so, but the worry lingered. He just he would hurry up and get there. And then he heard his name being called from the left. Turning so he could see, he smiled in relief as he saw Jack walking toward him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, kid,\" Jack smiled, looking more tired and stiff than Xander had ever seen him. \"Sorry, I'm late. I got held up at the base.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's alright,\" Xander replied, just happy that he was there and not being digested or anything. \"Been a busy week?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Jack sighed and rubbed a hand through his hair. \"Nothing like being understaffed to load up the paperwork.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"At your desk all day?\" Xander asked, thinking of his stiffness.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wish,\" Jack half laughed. \"I've been dealing with stupid requests and meetings for the most part.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And they didn't spring for pizza?\" Xander joked, receiving a sideways glance from Jack that wasn't very amused. \"Not even donuts?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No. But that sounds like a good idea. You mind stopping on the way home?  I don't feel like cooking.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"As long as you're asking about pizza and not donuts,\" Xander agreed. His days of sugar subsistence were long over.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So how are you doing? How's work?\" Jack asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh you know, it's Christmas,\" said Xander. \"Everyone comes in looking for the perfect present. Some people have some really weird ideas. There was this guy who came in the other day wanting to build an automatic clothesline for his wife so she wouldn't have to go outside to hang the wash. I tried to get him to check out a dryer but he insisted. Stupid man didn't know when to quit.\" It wasn't really all that interesting, but Jack smiled anyway and they ended up talking about other customers with strange ideas for the ride home. It was comfortable and Xander found himself relaxing into the easiness of the conversation that held no hidden traps or pitfalls.</p>\n\
    <p>They picked up pizza at a place not far from Jack's place and arrived at the house ten minutes later. Xander was staying in the same room where he deposited his stuff before rejoining Jack at the kitchen table.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So are you all getting together for Christmas again?\" asked Jack as Xander took his first slice, judiciously chosen to have the most toppings. Xander was only staying for four days until the twenty-third. He and Jack had both decided that a short visit was better than a long one at this point.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just a few of us,\" Xander replied. \"Buffy's home now with Dawn and Andrew. And Willow and Kennedy never left. Giles will be getting back the same day as me. Diana and Vi went to England to Vi's aunt's place.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Robin and Faith are in Africa?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sounds like another fun filled Christmas.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Holiday season,\" Xander corrected him. Off Jack's inquiring look he added, \"Willow's sort of Jewish and sort of pagan.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's an interesting combination,\" said Jack evenly, doing his best not to judge. Xander appreciated it, but it really wasn't necessary. He thought they were mutually exclusive too.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You should see our decorations,\" he said dryly. \"It's like Santa came in circumcised and decided to follow his wood sprite girlfriend's suggestions.\" Jack grinned. \"I'm serious,\" Xander went on. \"We have Hanukah candles lighting up an Earth shrine with the statue wearing an elf hat.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But does it look good? That's the true test of a decorating disaster,\" Jack noted, taking another piece of pizza.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shrugged. \"I think I'm used to it now. Though what about you? There isn't even a wreath on the door.\"</p>\n\
    <p>It was Jack's turn to look about his undecorated house and shrug. \"We're celebrating at Carter's house this year,\" he said by way of explanation. \"Even when we have it here, I don't put much out. I'm usually working down to the wire.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But you're a colonel. Don't you get extra time off?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I could,\" Jack agreed. \"But there's not much to come home to.\" No family except his friends, Xander remembered. And now him. Funny how similar they were in that regard.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Have you ever thought about remarrying?\" asked Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I've thought about it,\" said Jack, a little surprised by the question. \"Doesn't mean anyone was available.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Who was she?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"She?\" Jack lifted his eyebrows innocently, but Xander knew better.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You don't think about getting married without someone in mind,\" he said. \"So spill. Who's my potential stepmom?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Have you ever thought about getting married?\" Jack asked instead.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, no changing the subject!\" Xander raised a pointy finger. \"You're not answering the question.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Neither are you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's a personal question.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And I should answer it because . . . ?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We're bonding here. Guy talk.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I though guy talk was supposed to be about sports and stuff.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"The 'and stuff' is girls,\" Xander said as if he were explaining it to Andrew. Though he suspected Andrew's mind was on other things.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine,\" Jack sat back in his chair, a slight smile playing across his lips.  \"I'll tell you if you tell me who you thought about marrying.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You first,\" Xander agreed, his curiosity piqued.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack was silent for a moment before he spoke. \"There've been a couple actually. One was a woman I met while I was abroad for a couple of months . . . We were just friends at first, working together and after awhile it became more. But then work pulled me away again.\" He paused, then continued. \"And the other . . . I still work with her.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fraternization regulations?\" Xander asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How did you know?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I watch tv. Everyone know about those,\" Xander thought it was pretty common knowledge. \"What kind of women are they?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Smart. Independent,\" Jack shrugged searching for words. \"They're both people I respect a great deal.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Will I get to meet the one you work with?\" asked Xander as he tried to picture her. It was kind of odd how thinking about Jack with someone wasn't too bad.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shrugged noncommittally as if to say maybe, maybe not. \"So what about you?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>It was Xander's turn to sit back and think about how to describe Anya. How did you describe a hurricane to someone who wasn't there? It still saddened him to think about her, but time had indeed softened the loss into good memories. \"Her name was Anya,\" Xander began. \"She was pretty amazing.\" He pulled out his wallet and got out his only picture of her, worn around the edges by a year and a half of grief. It was of her standing by the cash register in the Magic Box holding a fan of twenty- dollar bills and smiling like the sun. Jack took the photo and smiled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She's beautiful,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Beautiful and greedy and embarrassingly blunt,\" Xander smiled back getting a pair of raised eyebrows from Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That why you broke up?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" Xander accepted the picture back. \"We were going to get married. But I wasn't ready; left her at the altar, families there and everything.\" He glanced up to see what Jack thought of that but the older man's face was inscrutable. \"I was afraid we'd end up like my parents. A year later we were almost back together. And then she died.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry,\" said Jack quietly. Xander nodded looking back at the picture.  God, he missed her! \"She loved money,\" he heard himself say. \"Loved the way it smelled and the way it could buy her pretty things. Sounds all valley girl when I say it like that, but it wasn't. She wasn't.\" He looked up. \"She thought fifty years was too little time to have together.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"How did she die?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"She never made it out of Sunnydale,\" Xander answered. And even this half- truth felt like betraying what she had died for. No matter how much she protested, she always came through for them against whatever big bad reared its ugly head. Once again he wondered what would have been had she lived. Would they be married now? He liked to think so.</p>\n\
    <p>He and Jack finished eating in silence that was only broken by Jack's offer of coffee, which Xander happily accepted. His thoughts still centered on Anya, but now he wondered what she would have thought of Jack. She would have wanted to see his gun. And he could just see Jack fluttering about nervously when she would say something about orgasms, perhaps with a witty comeback like Giles, only not as British. Or maybe not fluttering, Xander amended smiling at Jack's gray and rather dignified head across from him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" Jack noticed his gaze.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing,\" said Xander. \"Just thinking.\" Mentally shaking himself, he corralled his thoughts back to the here and now. \"So, we going clubbing tomorrow?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Clubbing? Ah, no,\" Jack shook his head. \"But my CO did invite us over for a Christmas party.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Will there be eggnog?\" he asked hopefully. Xander loved eggnog. He hadn't had any good 'nog since that last Christmas with Joyce. He grinned when Jack nodded. \"Then consider me party going.\"</p>\n\
    <p>**********************</p>\n\
    <p>The next evening, Jack waited impatiently by the door for Xander to get ready to go. When he finally emerged from his room in a clean long sleeve shirt, jeans, jacket, and shoes, Jack looked pointedly at his watch. They were going to be late. Jack hated being late.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Didn't you hear me tell you we were leaving in ten minutes?\" he asked as they got into the car.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I live with girls. You say ten minutes, I hear half an hour,\" Xander replied easily. \"Your CO's not going to kill us for being late to a party unless he's an social stickler of the deranged kind.\" He paused before adding, \"he's not, is he?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" Jack answered. \"Where do you come up with this stuff?\" Xander didn't deign to answer.</p>\n\
    <p>As it was they were still the first to arrive. \"Jack!\" He was greeted enthusiastically by George's granddaughter, Kayla who threw herself at him for a hug which Jack happily returned.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ooff! You're getting big!\" Jack exclaimed, amazed at how much she'd grown since the last time he'd seen her.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Not that big, Jack,\" Kayla protested as she stepped back with a huge grin.  \"Who's this?\" she asked noticing Xander behind him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"This is Xander,\" Jack introduced the two. \"My son,\" he added after a brief hesitation. He and Xander still didn't bring up their relationship that much, if ever. But if it bothered Xander, he didn't show it as he shook the little girl's hand.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I didn't know you had a son!\" Kayla was indignant that he hadn't told.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I lived with my mom,\" Xander explained with an easy smile.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh. Well it's really nice to meet you,\" she said. Just then, George and his daughter joined them from the kitchen.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack introduced Xander, amused at how the young man unconsciously straightened up in George's commanding presence.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's nice to meet you, sir,\" said Xander shaking his hand.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The pleasure's all mine, son. Jack here can't stop talking about you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander glanced at him, surprised by this news. Jack only shrugged. He really didn't talk about him that much; George was exaggerating, but Jack didn't bother to correct him when he was having so much fun. \"Now you've made me nervous,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Would I say anything bad about you?\" asked Jack mock hurt.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know, would you?\" Xander asked back, only half joking. He really wasn't sure, Jack saw, still uncertain about his place in Jack's life.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing but glowing praise,\" Jack reassured him, making Xander shift uncomfortably. \"None of Willow's stories got out.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The look of horror on Xander's face was priceless. \"They better not have.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I'm sure if you chat up Dr. Jackson and Major Carter, you can get some dirt of your own,\" George smugly smiled. \"And I know a few stories myself.\" Jack definitely didn't like the grin that blossomed on his son's face.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You are an evil, evil, man, sir,\" Jack told his CO.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes and there's not a thing you can do about it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>And with that, Jack knew that by the end of the night Xander would know every story the General had to offer. He could only thank God most of his exploits were classified.</p>\n\
    <p>**********************</p>\n\
    <p>A little over an hour later Xander managed to slip away for a moment with a plate full of food. More guests had arrived that he'd met while chatting with George. He really liked the portly general who had regaled him with the many headaches of Jack O'Neill. His father was apparently a practical joker, though it didn't surprise Xander that much. His favorite story was of when Jack had enlisted Private Shepherd, an actual German Shepherd who had a series of complaints filed against him for insubordination and slobbering on his colleagues. It had taken three weeks for the administration to realize they'd been played.</p>\n\
    <p>Now, sitting on the sidelines, Xander watched as Jack talked to Sam and Janet whom he'd met only briefly with her daughter earlier. When Kayla interrupted them, Jack gave her his full attention as if what she had to say was the most important thing in the world. He was good with kids, Xander thought, really good.</p>\n\
    <p>But the arrival of Daniel and Murray in his little corner of the living room pulled his attention away from Jack. Xander smiled at them in greeting, watching Murray in particular as he sat with his back straight and calmly began shoveling food into his mouth.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I see you finally got away from Hammond,\" said Daniel in greeting. \"I heard he was dishing out Jack stories?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep. Vengeance for my best friend spilling at Thanksgiving,\" Xander replied around a mouthful of scalloped potatoes.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, if he ever gives you a hard time, we've got a couple that the general doesn't know about,\" Daniel gestured between himself and Murray.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Vengeance, as you say,\" said Murray solemnly but with a smug little smile that was eerily reminiscent of George's. Good to know.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you're only staying till the twenty-third?\" asked Daniel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, I've got to work on Christmas Day,\" said Xander. Though not the main reason for leaving a little early, it at least didn't make him sound like he didn't want to be there. The truth was all about semantics.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And how has your vacation been?\" asked Murray in his precise tone that didn't sound quite right.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good,\" said Xander. It was an all-purpose answer but he didn't really have a better one. \"I just got in yesterday.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Would you care to join us at the mall tomorrow? We are going on a shopping excursion.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm not sure Jack's going to give you much of a choice,\" Daniel smiled. \"He hates having to suffer alone. And he says the rest of us don't count.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I guess, I'm in then,\" said Xander, not sure how he felt about going shopping with Jack and his friends. He suddenly felt like Giles in reverse, the young man out of the group, though he was at least grateful he wasn't going out with a bunch of older women. \"You guys Christmas shopping, or what?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Christmas shopping,\" Daniel sighed. \"We've been working pretty hard lately. Haven't had much time to get stuff done.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And I shall be purchasing a new hat,\" added Murray, very pleased with the idea. Xander eyed the monstrosity of red and white fake fur that sat low on the tall man's head. He had been wearing a hat the last time he'd met him, too.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So does the hat hide a perpetual bad hair day?\" he asked curiously. \"Cause they have stuff for that now.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I like hats,\" was the simple reply that was and wasn't an answer. Murray was just weird, Xander concluded. And possibly not human. The words, the posture, the hats \xE2\x80\x93 no self-respecting adult wore a Santa hat to an informal party and actually kept it on. But then again, George was wearing a reindeer sweater. Nevertheless, it was rather worrisome. Because what if he really wasn't human? The military had to know; those sorts of things didn't slip by them. Most of them.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Anyone want anything else to drink?\" Daniel interrupted his musing by standing with his empty cup. Both Xander and Murray shook their heads and the linguist left in search of a thirst quencher. They ate in silence for a moment before Xander decided to go ahead and ask.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So Murray, where're you from?\"</p>\n\
    <p>The big man looked up at him, swallowed the food in his mouth, and said, \"I am from Chulak, Colorado.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Where's that?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Three hours west of here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you human?\" The flat stare he received was anything but amused. \"Just kidding,\" Xander hastily backpedaled. \"Though it'd be okay if you weren't. Mostly. It'd actually depend but since I've no doubt that you are it's not really an issue so forget I even asked.\" Murray's expression didn't change. In fact, the blank stare was starting to creep Xander out, but finally Murray spoke.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I am. Why do you ask?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No reason,\" Xander waved it off, wishing once more that he'd just kept his mouth shut. It was probably a really stupid idea to antagonize the seven- foot giant sitting next to him. He was better off wondering in silence 'cause the silence wouldn't kill him. An uncomfortable minute passed during which Xander concentrated on eating and trying to ignore Murray's watchful eyes. It didn't work too well; he still felt like a bug under a microscope. He just wanted the other guy to look away.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander Harris,\" said Murray suddenly, \"how are things between you and O'Neill?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked up at the odd use of his name, slipping it into the see-he's- not-human column before his mind caught up with the question. \"Fine,\" he said. Other than the fact that they never really talked about anything.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He worries about you,\" said Murray. \"He wishes you would not hide things from him.\" Xander stared as Murray took another bite of his chicken. Where had that come from? But he knew \xE2\x80\x93 Thanksgiving. Secrets peeking out of shadows. Murray returned his gaze with that same calm expression that never seemed to change. \"I too have a son that I seldom see,\" he said softly. \"I know it is difficult. But O'Neill cares for you a great deal. I have known him for many years. He is an honorable man and he will never turn away from you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Even if I'm really Batman?\" asked Xander, a little stunned by Murray's unwavering faith in Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Even if you are Batman,\" Murray nodded once. \"Though he lives in Gothem City and not Cleveland.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He could have moved.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And leave the citizens to the evilness of the Joker? I think not. He would not abandon his responsibility to them.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Whose responsibility to whom?\" asked Sam Carter joining them with Daniel. The blond woman took the seat next to Murray.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Batman's to the people of Gothem City and why he would never leave,\" replied Murray. Sam looked at him in surprise, a wide grin breaking out on her face.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know much about that,\" she said, \"but I sure do love Robin's bike.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That was the only reason you saw that movie in the first place,\" said Daniel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You didn't like it either,\" Sam retorted.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, no,\" Daniel agreed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You have no taste,\" Murray intoned. \"It was an excellent movie. Though the first film was my favorite.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander watched as the three friends began arguing over the merits of the Batman movies. Murray loved them while Daniel and Sam kept poking holes in plots and special effects. But the banter was friendly and they were having a good time. They were obviously close, closer than Xander had realized the last time he was here. Daniel and Sam seemed to finish each other's thoughts while Murray had a counter argument for every point they brought up. Xander's opinion was asked for a couple of times and he had to agree that they were fun in their campy goodness. Soon he was arguing about who had been the best Batman. And every now and then he'd meet Murray's eyes that were smiling now instead of glaring, but that were still watchful. And seemed to say, 'even if you were Batman.'</p>\n\
    <p>***********************</p>\n\
    <p>Across the room, Jack watched Xander laughing with his team. It was cool to see the people who meant the most to him together and getting along. Not that he thought they wouldn't or anything, but it was still good to see.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack, you've got a fine son there,\" announced George as he joined him at the coffee table he'd commandeered. \"A very nice young man.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm afraid I didn't have much to do with that,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Maybe not,\" the general conceded, \"but he does remind me of a certain young sarcastic officer I used to know.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I certainly don't know who you're talking about, sir,\" said Jack playfully to the tease. \"So what stories did you tell him?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Only the best,\" George evaded.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Stories?\" Cassie Frasier said joining them. \"You were telling Jack stories and I wasn't there?\" She batted hurt eyelashes at George, very disappointed she had missed it. Jack on the other hand was very grateful. Xander knowing was bad enough but at least he had the inside scoop on him. Cassie on the other hand he couldn't touch, the reason in the form of one short doctor settling in beside her daughter next to him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think you already know enough about me,\" said Jack. \"You already had an unfair advantage over Xander.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's still not fair,\" Cassie grumbled, though she wasn't really that upset about it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Maybe if you talk to Xander, you can ask him,\" suggested Janet with a sly look at Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Doc, are you trying to set our kids up?\" he asked suspiciously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wouldn't go for him anyway,\" said Cassie while her mother protested innocently. Immediately, Jack switched to being offended on his son's behalf.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And why not? There's nothing wrong with him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's not my type,\" Cassie shrugged. \"He's too . . . happy.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Happy?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You know . . . going on though life unaware. He just seems like the kind of guy it'd be hard to have a deep conversation with . . . I mean . . .\" she stopped, suddenly realizing what she had just said and blushed. \"I don't mean that he's shallow or anything . . . cause I'm sure he'd not. And he has the whole one-eye thing going for him that's pretty cool . . .\" She trailed off, deciding that stopping was better than digging the hole deeper.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack smiled to show he wasn't offended. He could see how she would get that impression. Here Xander was always smiling and joking, hell most of the time he acted as if the next great disaster was a bad day at work. But then there were the little things he didn't talk about like growing up in Sunnydale, his parents, his eye. Xander lived in the here and now, not dwelling on the past, not worrying about the future.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How did he lose it?\" asked Janet.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack could only shrug. \"He hasn't told me. I asked the first time we met, and he wouldn't say anything. I thought at first that it was because we had just met but . . .\" He had lied about the deep cut on his arm too. \"I guess he's just not ready to tell me some things,\" he smiled for the others, not wanting to bring up things that were better left between him and his son. Though how he would find out without driving Xander away, he didn't know. From where he sat, it looked like serious fighting, gang fighting, though Xander seemed far from the type to get involved in that sort of thing. And his friends seemed to be involved which was even weirder if it was gangs because the bubbly girls he had met were also not the type. There were just too many mysteries and none of them added up.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack sighed and let it go for now as it was neither the time nor the place.  Maybe later he'd work up the nerve to ask. Maybe he should just wait until he knew Xander better. Maybe he shouldn't say anything at all.</p>\n\
    <p>***********************</p>\n\
    <p>When they got home that night, Xander sat down heavily on the couch, tired from the long evening. Behind him Jack was talking to Daniel as the two looked for the book the linguist had stopped by to get. Apparently he'd been looking for it for a week before he remembered he'd left it at Jack's after coming over to dinner once. Though from the sound of things, Jack had lost the book too. Xander let their playful back and forth wash over him as he relaxed. He was almost dozing when the phone rang in the kitchen.</p>\n\
    <p>It rang once more before Jack picked it up. \"O'Neill . . . alright . . . alright . . . call Major Carter. Dr. Jackson's with me.\" Xander heard him hang up, and wondered what was going on. Jack soon appeared from the kitchen, all trace of humor gone from his face. \"Xander, Daniel and I have to go to the base. Will you be alright here?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"At eleven thirty at night?\" Xander asked. That seemed a little late to him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's probably nothing,\" Jack forced a smile and Xander could see that he clearly didn't believe it was nothing. If it was nothing, there'd be some serious shouting going on over the phone right now. No, Jack was worried about something. And Daniel the linguist and Sam the astrophysicist were wanted too. \"We'll be back soon.\" Vaguely Xander nodded as he watched them grab their coats and go. They had a silent conversation in eyebrows and headshakes and then they were gone, leaving Daniel's car in the driveway.</p>\n\
    <p>Whatever they were doing, it made Xander nervous all of a sudden. Initiative nervous. Because why did a deep space telescope need a linguist and a special forces colonel in the middle of the night?</p>\n\
    <p>Wide awake now, he turned on the tv to try and banish his worries from his head but it didn't work too well. It was only when he heard the electronic strands of the Peanuts theme coming from his room that thoughts of secret military organizations finally went away. Because he suddenly had bigger fish to worry about. After a stunned second, Xander leapt up and ran for his phone that he'd put on top of the dresser.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hello?\" he answered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander?\" Willow's voice came down the virtual line.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, it's me. What's up?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We just got an SOS from a slayer in Broomfield, Colorado,\" said Willow. Xander's blood ran cold. \"Her name's Courtney, she's thirteen \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Her parents didn't want her coming to training this year,\" Xander remembered the conversation he'd had with them that had been so frustrating.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She was hysterical on the phone and hung up before I could get all the details. All I know is that there was a major attack and that she's in trouble. Have you got a car?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"If you have directions.\" Xander went to his bag and dug out his stake, cross, water gun and liter of holy water. Quickly, he went into the living room and found Daniel's keys, only feeling a little guilty about borrowing his car. Willow stayed on the phone and gave him directions from her computer in Cleveland. The drive took two hours going almost ninety on the highway. Xander only hoped a cop didn't stop him. But he was more scared about what he would find once he got to Broomfield.</p>\n\
    <p>Potentials became slayers when they hit puberty at which time Willow felt them join the network. She had a special locator spell that found the new slayer, wherever she was so that the Watcher's Council could find her, offer her training, and help her into her new life. In North America, Xander was point man in that department. Now, driving in the dark, he couldn't help but feel like he had failed Courtney somehow but not talking her parents round. He'd thought he'd done well by getting them to agree to next summer, but now it looked like next summer would be too late.</p>\n\
    <p>Once he was off the freeway, Xander followed Willows direction to a nice neighborhood in suburbia. And then he saw the fire. A great billow of smoke rose above the houses with tendrils of orange licking at its base. As he drew closer, he heard sirens and shouting and water hoses as firefighters tried to control the blaze. It was like graduation all over again. How was he going to find Courtney in this mess?</p>\n\
    <p>He got as close as he could before parking the car and going on foot. Willow had said she had called from the house that was now torching to a crisp. Xander hoped she had made it out alive. A quick look through the emergency vehicles came up with nothing so he moved past them to the edge of the spectators who watched in disbelief. He'd met Courtney once, over a year ago. She'd been in awe of her new power, excited and scared all at once. Where would she be now? Xander just kept walking away from the crowds, the heat of the burning house at his back.</p>\n\
    <p>And then he saw her hidden in between two closely growing trees in someone's front yard, staring at the flames, unnoticed by anyone else but him. As soon as he started walking in her direction though, she looked at him, watching like a scared cat as he approached. Her shirt was torn and dirty, bleeding cuts streaked down her arms and the corner of her mouth was a brilliant red. In her hand she clenched a stake, her whole body ready and tense for a fight.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Courtney?\" said Xander softly. He held up his cross and stake from her to see, see that he wasn't burning. \"I'm Xander Harris with the Watcher's Council. Do you remember me?\" She didn't answer but her eyes flickered from his face to his hands and back. \"I'm going to get out my driver's license and my id card, okay?\" He waited until she nodded slightly before fishing out his wallet. The id card was for the Council, charmed so that it couldn't be tampered with. He tossed them to the ground in front of her where she picked them up and inspected them. Courtney looked up a moment later, the tension fading from her.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sorry,\" she whispered. \"I \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Don't be sorry,\" said Xander. He walked slowly towards her making sure she wouldn't suddenly attack him. \"What happened?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"They came.\" She turned back to the house. \"A whole gang. My little brother let them in . . . there were so many of them.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Your family?\"</p>\n\
    <p>The tears that streamed down her face were the only answer he needed as the girl before him started to shake. Xander reached out a hand to her shoulder offering her the only comfort he could. The gesture broke the wall that had held the reality at bay through the horror of the last few hours and she latched onto him with a wrenching sob of pain. Xander just held on while her world crumbled around her like the house down the street, lost to the violence of the night.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He said it was retribution,\" Courtney cried. \"I don't even know what that means! And then he killed them, right in front of me. They were screaming and I couldn't do anything!\" Her voice broke in her throat in counterpoint to her labored breathing. \"I should have died too!\" she sobbed. \"I should have died!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know,\" Xander murmured, rubbing her back. \"But you survived.\" Survived to live in a world without her family. And though she wanted to die now from the pain, Xander knew that she would make it because she was a fighter. He didn't need two eyes to see that she hadn't given up, not in the house, not out here.</p>\n\
    <p>After a few minutes, she calmed some, her cries dissolving into hiccups. Beyond them the firefighters had gotten the fire under control, diminishing the flames to embers. \"Do you think they'll be mad?\" Courtney asked. \"About the fire? It was the only way.\" The only way to kill the vampires, Xander knew.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why don't have to tell them,\" said Xander. They would figure out what they needed to on their on own.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what now?\" she asked. \"I mean, my family's dead. I've got nowhere to go. My house is gone. I burned my house!</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, hey, hey,\" Xander soothed before she lost it again. Courtney looked at him wide-eyed and terrified. \"Let's not panic.\"</p>\n\
    <p>What now indeed. The authorities would only take her to a children's shelter, then foster care if no relatives stepped up to claim her. All were people who wouldn't know that her family had just been murdered, wouldn't understand, wouldn't care. They'd find out she set the fire and then she'd be blamed. What she needed was support right now, friends, family.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you have any relatives nearby?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>Courtney shook her head. \"My aunt and uncle live in Missouri.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is there anyone you want to stay with?\" But she shook her head. \"Then you're coming with me,\" he decided. He wasn't about to strand her here, not traumatized and an easy target for the rest of the local vamps. No, the safest thing for her was to come with him now. He handed her his cell phone. \"Call your best friend, let her know you're okay. Tell her your cousin came to get you,\" he instructed when she just stared at it then him blankly. But she did as he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>A few minutes later, they were skirting the dwindling group of spectators behind the fire trucks, heading toward the car. Not long after that they were back on the road heading for Colorado Springs. It wasn't until Courtney fell asleep exhausted, that Xander even thought about what he would tell Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>**********************</p>\n\
    <p>To say Jack was worried was an understatement. To say Jack was worried and mad and confused as all hell would be closer to the truth. In fact he was pretty pissed off. Things had been bad enough when the tok'ra arrived with their sudden discovery of Anubis amassing his forces and Jack's Christmas holiday was cut short. Then he came home around one trying to figure out what he'd tell Xander only to find that Xander had taken off in Daniel's car without so much as leaving a note and some pretty hasty unpacking of his bag. The only good thing Jack could see in this whole situation was that most of his stuff was still here, and even that really hadn't helped his bad mood much</p>\n\
    <p>But now it was four in the morning. Daniel had gotten a cab home, and Jack hadn't slept for worrying about Xander and what the hell he had been doing for the last three hours. He was going to kill him when he got back. Just what was he playing at?</p>\n\
    <p>Headlights in the driveway immediately grabbed his attention. He rose as the car doors opened and shut and was in front of the front door when it opened. Xander stopped short when he saw the glare Jack was leveling at him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Where the hell have you been?!\" he demanded. He could see the sarcastic reply forming on Xander's lips until he thought better of it and answered simply.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Broomfield.\" He licked his lips. \"It was an emergency.\" And then Jack saw the girl standing slightly behind his son. She was young, barely a teenager with auburn hair that was a tangled mess. Dried blood and dirt streaked her clothes underneath Xander's jacket that she wore while faded bruises and tearstains peppered her chin.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I see,\" said Jack softly, taken aback. The girl looked like she was about to fall over. \"I'm Jack,\" he offered her his hand, which she dully shook.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Come on,\" Xander ushered her to his room, laving her in the bathroom to get cleaned up. \"Where's your first aid kit?\" he asked when he returned. Jack got it for him then waited in the kitchen for Xander to get back after getting the girl settled. Jack was so surprised by this sudden turn of events that he didn't know what to think. Mostly he was confused and even more worried than he had been. His anger giving way to fear which only jumpstarted more anger. He ended up making coffee while he waited.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You want to tell me what's going on?\" he asked when he heard Xander in the doorway. His son didn't move for a moment but he finally joined Jack at the table. He looked exhausted. Small wonder after a long day and four hours of driving to Broomfield and back.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Courtney called Willow. Willow called me,\" was all Xander said as he poured himself a cup of coffee.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She was in a fight,\" Jack commented, trying to keep his voice low. \"And you both smell like smoke.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Her house burned down.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So why is she with you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked up then away quickly and didn't answer. And Jack knew that when he did it would be another lie.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jesus, Xander, what are you involved in?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Who said I was involved with anything?\" Xander snapped back, getting angry. \"She's a girl from camp this summer. She was in trouble, she called us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"She calls people she barely knows in Cleveland instead of her local 9-11?\" Jack couldn't believe it. \"She was in. a. fight. I'm not an idiot Xander.  I can tell grab marks and punches from a random crash to the ground. And it's not just her. You and Willow were pretty beat up over Thanksgiving.\" That got Xander's attention. The young man's head snapped up but he remained silent. \"So, yes, I think you're involved in something,\" said Jack. \"Feel free to prove me wrong.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's none of your business.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"*You *are my business. And if that's not enough then I think stealing my friend's car and kidnapping a thirteen year-old and hiding her at my house make it my business.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine,\" Xander got to his feet. \"We'll go to a hotel. We'll be out of here in an hour.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander!\" Jack wanted to strangle him. Running was not going to solve this and he'd be damned if he let his son run out on him now. \"I'm not throwing you out. I just want to know what's going on!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I can't tell you because I've got people to protect!\" Xander said harshly. They were standing, facing each other now. \"Consider it classified, Jack. You should know all about that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Jack felt like he'd been slapped.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Linguists don't go on maneuvers, Jack,\" said Xander. \"And no one on a little shit project gets called into base in the middle of the night five days before Christmas. I'm not an idiot either and I spy with my little eye a secret government program.\"</p>\n\
    <p>At his words, Jack saw all the fear and distrust his son had for him at that moment. And it hurt like nothing else had since his team had thought he'd betrayed them. \"Yes, my work is classified,\" he said. \"But what does it have to do with you bringing home a kid whose house just burned down?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing,\" said Xander looked away then back, meeting him stare for stare. \"I'm just saying, I'm not the only one keeping secrets around here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you don't trust me,\" said Jack. \"Is that it?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't trust who work for,\" Xander replied evenly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"This is me, Xander,\" Jack pleaded, suddenly tired. \"I'm your dad first. This has nothing to do with what I do or can't talk about. If you're in trouble, if you need me I'm yours.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The young man looked away at the table, uncertainty in every line of his body. When he finally looked back he said, \"I'm not in any trouble.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack's protest at the obvious denial was cut short by a scream from the guestroom. Immediately, Xander bolted down the hall, Jack on his heels. Courtney was thrashing in her sleep while Xander tried to shake her awake without getting hit by flailing limbs.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Courtney, wake up!\" said Xander loudly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"They're here!\" the girl shouted as she woke with a start. \"They were screaming! Oh God \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" Xander pulled her into his arms while she dissolved into tears. Jack simply watched him soothe the distraught girl, realizing a moment later that this was another side of Xander he hadn't seen, hadn't even known about. His son as the adult in control, rocking the poor girl. Xander was the helper here, but why him, Jack wondered. He tried to make it sound simple, but how could it be? If anything Xander should be at a police station in Broomfield right now instead of at Jack's house. People to protect, he'd said. Courtney? The other girls? They had people to protect them already, families, police, in theory anyway.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You want a book?\" Xander asked a few minutes later when Courtney settled down some.</p>\n\
    <p>When she nodded, Jack volunteered to go find one. He didn't have much in the way of fiction around but he managed to find a Star Wars novel that Teal'c had left behind. Courtney accepted it with a watery smile.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Here,\" Xander reached to his discarded jacket and pulled a rather large wooden cross out of the pocket. Courtney took it from him, her fingers running over the wood in fascination. \"I know it's not much consolation, but they're in Heaven now.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"How do you know?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Friend of mine's been there.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It should have been me,\" she whispered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It shouldn't have been anyone,\" Xander countered. \"It just is.\" He squeezed her hand. \"I'll be right outside.\"</p>\n\
    <p>He and Jack retreated to the kitchen. Xander once more refused to look at him. \"We're leaving tomorrow,\" he finally said breaking the tense silence.  \"Willow's getting us tickets.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack nodded, unhappy about it, but what could he do? \"What was with the cross?\" he asked instead.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Security blanket,\" Xander looked up, appearing very tired all of a sudden.  And older than his twenty-three years. The man before him was far removed from the kid of yesterday.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Security blanket, huh?\" Jack didn't quite buy it. It was becoming a familiar feeling, and one that he really didn't like. \"Don't you think we know each other well enough to cut all this crap?\" he asked wearily. But Xander just gave him an inscrutable look.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you believe in vampires?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Vampires?\" Jack repeated, not sure he had heard correctly. He was way too tired to try and follow this. \"As in Dracula?\" Xander twitched slightly but nodded. \"No, why?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Could you?\" Xander went on.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What does that have to do with anything?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just answer the question.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack paused before saying a flat out 'no'. He wasn't sure what metaphor Xander was going for but maybe it was one of Daniel's paradigm shift things. Besides, he'd certainly seen enough other stuff walk out of legends. Only on other planets. So he shrugged and said, \"yeah, maybe,\" hoping it was the right answer. \"Why?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"'Cause until you do, you don't know me,\" said Xander. And with that parting remark, he went and crashed on the couch. Jack sat down at the table wondering what the hell he meant by that before finally deciding that it was way to late \xE2\x80\x93 early in the morning to try and figure it out. But as he went to bed himself, he wondered if he would ever have the chance to find out.</p>\n\
    <p>*******************************</p>\n\
    <p>The next morning Jack woke to find the house empty with a note and brightly wrapped package on the table.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack,\" he read. \"We called a cab for the airport. I'm sorry that everything got out of hand last night. I left your present on the table. Hope you like it. Merry Christmas, Xander.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack set the note aside and fingered his oddly shaped present. White snowmen grinned up at him from a red background. Gently he tore it open. Inside was rough wood carving of a flying eagle with a little boy on his back. The detail wasn't great but the paint helped to fill it out and catch the essence of flight. A loop of string came through the boy's head for hanging on a tree. It was really magnificent. The maker's mark on the tail read 'XH.'</p>\n\
    <p>Jack smiled briefly, impressed and touched. And scared he wouldn't see Xander again.</p>\n\
    <p>**************************** ****************************</p>\n\
    <p>AN: I almost don't want to ask, but how was it? Especially the Teal'c part. And the confrontation . . . And just everything else.</p>\n\

    Once there was a Prince who wanted to marry a Princess. Only a real one would do. So he traveled through all the world to find her, and everywhere things went wrong. There were Princesses aplenty, but how was he to know whether they were real Princesses? There was something not quite right about them all. So he came home again and was unhappy, because he did so want to have a real Princess.
    
    One evening a terrible storm blew up. It lightened and thundered and rained. It was really frightful! In the midst of it all came a knocking at the town gate. The old King went to open it.
    
    Who should be standing outside but a Princess, and what a sight she was in all that rain and wind. Water streamed from her hair down her clothes into her shoes, and ran out at the heels. Yet she claimed to be a real Princess.
    
    "We'll soon find that out," the old Queen thought to herself. Without saying a word about it she went to the bedchamber, stripped back the bedclothes, and put just one pea in the bottom of the bed. Then she took twenty mattresses and piled them on the pea. Then she took twenty eiderdown feather beds and piled them on the mattresses. Up on top of all these the Princess was to spend the night.
    
    In the morning they asked her, "Did you sleep well?"
    
    " Oh!" said the Princess. "No. I scarcely slept at all. Heaven knows what's in that bed. I lay on something so hard that I'm black and blue all over. It was simply terrible."
    
    They could see she was a real Princess and no question about it, now that she had felt one pea all the way through twenty mattresses and twenty more feather beds. Nobody but a Princess could be so delicate. So the Prince made haste to marry her, because he knew he had found a real Princess.
    
    As for the pea, they put it in the museum. There it's still to be seen, unless somebody has taken it.
    
    There, that's a true story.

    <p>********************Eight Men in Black********************</p>\n\
    <p>Jack was distracted all morning. At the briefing of SG team leaders at 0900, he barely heard as Hammond went over the intel they had received from the tok'ra last night about Anubis on P-something. Basically the general was warning them that the military teams might be called to duty even though it was Christmas. SGs 1 and 6 were the only ones on standby at the moment for the recon missions.</p>\n\
    <p>But since Jack knew all this, his greatest fear at the moment was that Hammond was going to call on him for input. Because he really wasn't in any sort of mental state to know what he was supposed to add since he hadn't been paying attention to what the general had already said. His mind instead kept going over his fight last night with Xander, trying to figure it out, figure out a way to speak to him again after his son's flat refusal to talk.</p>\n\
    <p>It was just . . . confusing. And frustrating. And he wanted to check out that fire in Broomfield because he was sure it was Courtney Xander was protecting. But from the military? She was a kid. The military wouldn't care about her unless she was a miniature terrorist in disguise. Wait \xE2\x80\x93 that couldn't be it, could it? Xander as a part of some terrorist cell? The very thought chilled him as he immediately rejected the idea. Not Xander, he wasn't the type. He didn't have a mission and he was too lighthearted to care. But then, it wasn't the lighthearted Xander he had gotten to know that had faced him last night, deadly serious and not giving an inch.</p>\n\
    <p>And that was another thought that scared Jack because how could he have missed the capable young man underneath all the friendly banter. He knew he hadn't, not completely. Glimpses were there, buried in stunned memory of their first meeting and snatches of conversation since. But it wasn't something he had really thought about before because he had never tried to profile Xander before. He just was. And now the question was what was he doing that he didn't want the military or government to find out about. That left knife wounds on his arms and handprints on his friends. That had him practically kidnapping a beat-up girl whose house had burned down. That had a metaphor in vampires.</p>\n\
    <p>That was maybe the weirdest part of all this. And the most cutting, being flat out told that whatever he and Xander had did not even scratch the surface. But mixed up with the stinging hurt, Jack still couldn't figure out the vampire thing. All he knew about them was that they drank blood, slept in coffins, and could count really well. Though he didn't think Sesame Street was what Xander had been talking about. But then sometimes he really couldn't follow what Xander was talking about, and now he couldn't ask because his son had taken off, kidnapped girl and all. Though she certainly hadn't been resisting. But having nightmares of people coming and people screaming \xE2\x80\x93 people in Heaven \xE2\x80\x93 and taking a cross as a security blanket.</p>\n\
    <p>Why had Xander had a cross in the first place? Jack knew he wasn't religious. But that he did believe in Heaven and Hell. And the friend he'd mentioned, was that Jesse? Anya? But still, why was a cross a security blanket? That made no sense. None of it made sense to Jack's sleep deprived brain. And Xander had hopped the first plane back to Cleveland.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel O'Neill?\" General Hammond's voice snapped him back to the briefing at hand. Around him the other team leaders were shuffling to their feet, the briefing obviously over. On his pad, Jack had drawn stick figures with fangs and bat wings, underlined by a row of question marks. One of them wore an eyepatch. Maybe that was it, he though sarcastically as he pushed the pad away face down and turned to Hammond. Maybe Xander was really a vampire.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you all right, Colonel?\" asked Hammond a concerned frown on his face.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, sir,\" Jack mustered a smile for him, despite the cold inside. Hammond paused a moment longer before deciding to take him at his word.</p>\n\
    <p>\"SG-1's briefing will be at 1100,\" he went on. \"We don't have too much information about the planet Anubis is using so we'll be working with the tok'ra on this one, Colonel. I expect you to at least make an effort.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, I always make an effort, sir,\" said Jack. \"Besides it's Christmas. Good will and all that.\" Hammond gave him a hard stare but said nothing at the dig. Jack knew he would rather be at home with his granddaughters too and suddenly felt bad for opening his mouth. \"Sorry, sir.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I've had another call from Major Davis,\" Hammond continued as if he hadn't said anything. \"Kinsey has moved on from Christmas phone calls to members of the Congressional Appropriations Committee to a few people at the Pentagon. Now, I don't know any names yet . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But he's looking for support come inauguration day,\" Jack finished. \"Are we sure the election wasn't rigged?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, I know,\" Jack sighed. Politics and power. Kinsey and Anubis, both converging pains in the ass.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll see you at 1100 then,\" Hammond dismissed him. Jack nodded and left, his thoughts temporarily redirected angrily at Kinsey for fighting them from the inside. It was no wonder Xander didn't trust the military, because if Kinsey was in charge?</p>\n\
    <p>Which reminded Jack of Xander's own deduction that he worked on a top secret project. He sighed again. They really needed to come up with a better cover story, especially for why Daniel worked for them. He still didn't know how he was going to explain this one to the general. Arrrrgh! Why did all this have to hit the fan right now? God, he needed a cup of coffee. Daniel better have something good and strong, he thought as he neared the archeologist's office. Cause if he didn't Jack would be very disappointed.</p>\n\
    <p>A quick glance at the coffeepot perched precariously on a filing cabinet showed good news, however, the first Jack had had all day.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack,\" Daniel said by way of greeting when he came in without knocking.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Daniel,\" Jack gave him a half-hearted smile. He made his way, carefully, to the coffee, grabbing the spare mug from an equally precarious position on a stack of books nearby.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Bad news?\" Daniel finally asked, his voice filtering softly over the stream of dark liquid.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shrugged, turning and taking a sip. He leaned back against the cabinet. \"Same as last night. Briefing's at 1100.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel waited a beat, then asked, \"Then what's with the . . . long face?\" he settled on.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack rubbed a tired hand over his face sincerely hoping he didn't look as bad as he felt, but at the same time knowing he did. But he was glad Daniel had asked. Saved having to bring it up himself, at least. \"Xander left this morning,\" he answered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Left?\" Daniel was surprised as well he should be. \"He didn't come back?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He came back,\" Jack corrected. \"Around four this morning. Brought a ten- year old girl with him. Said her house had burned down. He wouldn't tell me what was going on beyond that. They left for Cleveland this morning before I got up.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel stared in surprise, a crease forming between is eyes. \"He just left?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We kinda had a fight,\" Jack admitted. He smiled sourly. \"Turns out he's stubborn too.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel didn't crack a smile. \"I'm amazed he got a flight out.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Four days before Christmas he got a flight home within what? six hours of needing it?\"</p>\n\
    <p>It was expensive too, now that Jack thought about. He knew Xander had a job but he didn't think he made that kind of money. Drugs? Again, Jack rejected the idea. There were no signs of that, though the vampire metaphor might fit that, sucking his life away little by little. But what did a girl's house burning down mean? Who was Xander protecting?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack,\" Daniel repeated his name he realized.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sorry, what?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did you sleep at all last night?\" He shrugged in answer. Daniel glanced back at the computer screen he'd been working on, hit a few keys, then turned back to Jack. \"Explain what happened again.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What happened?\" asked Carter as she walked in with Teal'c. Jack noticed she had brought her own mug.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander left this morning,\" Jack said moving out of her way. Both Carter and Teal'c stopped short at the news while Jack went on to tell about the girl, her nightmare, and Xander's complete lack of trust in him or the government. \"And he figured out that I work for a top secret project,\" he finished, hearing again in memory the harsh accusation that Jack had lied to him too.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander Harris is most perceptive,\" said Teal'c. \"Last night he asked me if I was human.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He what?!\" Jack started so violently his coffee sloshed over his hand.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He asked if I was human and then hastily retracted the question,\" Teal'c repeated. \"I believe. It was difficult to follow but he did not press the subject.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Perceptive indeed, thought Jack worried more than ever. Now what did that mean? His mental list of mysteries was getting way to long. \"Daniel, what do you know about vampires?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Vampires?\" both he and Carter chorused at this new wrench in the works.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He said I wouldn't know him until I believed in vampires,\" Jack explained with another grimace. \"And if I knew what that meant you'd be the first to know,\" he added off his team's questioning looks.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, they drink blood,\" Daniel offered recovering quickly, his expression furrowed as he thought about it. \"Don't like sunlight, garlic, or religious objects . . . I think you have to kill them with something wooden. Are you sure he said vampires?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dead sure,\" Jack grimaced at the pun that slipped out.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well,\" said Daniel. \"I don't have time to really find anything now, but I will once we get back from the mission.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Right, the mission. The job they paid him the big bucks for, and yes that was sarcasm. Jack should be focusing on that right now. Daniel and Carter had background research to do and he had to get his requisitions in before the briefing as well. And then there'd be no time while they were offworld figuring out what Anubis was up to \xE2\x80\x93 and then he'd be tied up trying to figure out what they were going to do about whatever they found out. No time till later to call and try and patch things up, no time for Carter to make sure Xander wasn't a terrorist or drug lord, no time to do anything but worry about keeping the planet safe. This really sucked.</p>\n\
    <p>But when Jack got back to his office after reminding his team about the briefing, he decided that it was too important to put off. So he grabbed his phone and called Xander's number from memory only to hang up disappointed when the dull tone of the busy signal washed back across the country.</p>\n\
    <p>**************************</p>\n\
    <p>Xander hung up the phone with a sigh. Courtney's aunt and uncle in Missouri were frantic and not taking too well to the fact that he'd made off with her after the fire. Suspicious and confused, they kept threatening to call the police and we're greatly surprised when Xander told them to go ahead and even found the local number for them. Speaking to Courtney had helped and finally after two days of phone calls, they had agreed to drive to Cleveland to see her.</p>\n\
    <p>From what Courtney had told him, they weren't very close, but they did see each other every couple of summers when schedules lined up so they weren't strangers by any means. And family was what Courtney needed right now, people who had known and loved her parents and brother whom she could grieve with. And since they were probably going to become her legal guardians they needed to know the truth about how they had died and accept it sooner rather than later.</p>\n\
    <p>Standing, Xander stretched the kinks out of his back that came from sitting too long and glanced out the kitchen window over the back yard. Fresh snow covered the ground and hung lightly on the tree branches like in a picture book. Indented lines of old footsteps crossed back and forth with a new path broken over them that led toward the bench under the trees. Courtney sat there alone. She was still in shock, Xander knew, that phase of knowing but not *knowing* in her heart that they were gone. Buffy or Dawn would go out and get her soon, the Slayer offering training and the teenager a chance to bake cookies or something. It was funny how much better they'd gotten at this, knowing when someone needed time alone and when they needed a distraction. But Xander didn't smile because it really wasn't funny at all.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She still out there?\" asked Willow, coming up behind him. He felt her move to just behind his right shoulder, not needing to look at her as he nodded. Willow was silent for a moment, then said, \"the police in Colorado are still looking for her but don't know you took her. They think she ran away.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Have they talked to her aunt and uncle?\" asked Xander, slightly surprised.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know,\" said Willow softly. \"They're calling it a Christmas tree fire right now but the investigation's still open.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander nodded again. It was only a matter of time till the authorities figured out that she was in Cleveland, especially since they weren't really making a secret out of it. Xander thought back over his impulse to have Courtney call her best friend. A stupid idea but at the time important. Important for her friend to have hope, and yeah, worry a lot, but at least know that she was alive. He wondered if Courtney had ever told her that she was a slayer. He knew she had gone out and hunted a few times, scared and alone but curious and excited about her new power coursing through her blood. She had staked a few fledglings and a minion or two, which had only served to get her noticed by the local posse. Who had then decided to let her know who was in charge.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why don't we quit, Will?\" Xander asked quietly. \"Why don't we just wake up one morning and walk away? Leave all the death and danger behind us and never look back?\"</p>\n\
    <p>No answer, just white snow, pure and innocent, then, \"Do you think you could?\" Willow's voice was soft. Xander didn't answer. He didn't need to because they both knew the answer was simply 'no'. It was as much their destiny now as it had been Buffy's, only theirs by choice.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We should call the other girls,\" he said instead. \"Make sure they're doing okay.\" He turned away from the window and the bleakness outside. \"Courtney's relatives are coming. They should be here in a couple of days.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm going to leave soon to get Giles. You wanna come?\" asked Willow. But Xander shook his head, the drive to the airport not appealing to his exhaustion. Willow smiled slightly and then left him to go get her shoes and coat. Xander went to the sitting room and collapsed on the couch. It was the twenty-third and felt nothing like Christmas. He was supposed to be getting back from Jack's today, home from the vacation that wasn't.</p>\n\
    <p>His last night there was a blur of smoke and worry, shadowed by distrust. Xander didn't know what scared him more: the fact the Jack hadn't denied working on a secret government project or his unwavering concern that seemed genuine. No one besides the Scoobies had ever cared so much about what was going on in Xander's life or had even been worried that he might be doing something dangerous. How was he supposed to react to that? Telling him the truth didn't seem like an option in light of the secret project, but then for all Xander knew it could be something as normal as an anti-terrorist bomb or something. A linguist would sure be useful there.</p>\n\
    <p>And in the back of his mind, Xander couldn't help but think about what Murray had said, that Jack would stick by him no matter what. And the pleading on Jack's face when he'd said the same thing. One more time. Jack had been saying it since they met that, that he was going to be a part of Xander's life come hell or high water. So should he tell him? Was it caution or the cynicism born of being raised by drunks that was holding him back? Xander didn't know the answer to either question. He just . . . didn't know.</p>\n\
    <p>*************************</p>\n\
    <p>The first clue Xander had that something was wrong was the sound of birds screaming through his ear, shocking him into wakefulness. His second clue was the green glow that pervaded his and Andrew's room, lighting it up slightly in some warped version of night vision goggles. He could barely make out the normally red numbers on his alarm clock \xE2\x80\x93 it was three o' seven.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Wha \xE2\x80\x93 what's that noise?\" groaned Andrew from the other bed. Xander could see him curled up against the softening sound.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The wards have been breached,\" Xander told him groggily, rolling out of bed. \"Come on, get up.\" Barely awake he simply reacted to this new threat and leaned over the foot of his bed to grab his favorite battleaxe and stake from where they lay on top of his toolbox. Behind him he heard Andrew hiss from the cold and scramble for his own stake. Two seconds later the two of them were out in the hallway \xE2\x80\x93Andrew wrapped up in his bathrobe and Xander in his blue flannel pjs. They joined at the end of the wall at the top of the stairs where they couldn't be seen from the open foyer below. At the other end of the hall, also standing back from sight, were the girls who looked madder than hell that their beauty rest had just gotten interrupted. Willow was the only one missing.</p>\n\
    <p>But suddenly her voice was echoing inside Xander's head. \"They are eight of them just past the first ward,\" she said. The first ward was at the edge of the lawn. Their cue that the second ward that was etched into the walls of the house had been crossed would be the return to darkness. \"I think they're human but they have guns and look military. Four are approaching the front door, four the back.\" She was silent. \"They're not stopping at the light.\" The soft green glow that illuminated the house was meant to scare away those who dared attack them.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Kennedy, Giles, Willow, and Andrew, take position here,\" ordered Buffy through Willow's telepathic link. \"Giles and Andrew hide downstairs. Wait till they all get inside then hit them. Kennedy, you and Willow will have to distract them enough so Giles and Andrew can get them from behind.\" The younger slayer nodded confidently in understanding. \"The rest of us will cover the back.\" Without waiting, Buffy led them down the stairs to the kitchen and the back door, ducking and grabbing extra weapons along the way. Dawn she put in the hall bathroom to get at the first person through there, Xander got the spot just behind the dining room door in case they came through there, while Buffy and Courtney covered the kitchen, hiding behind the island counter.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Courtney, are you ready for this?\" he heard her ask the young slayer. \"Remember, you're stronger and faster. Don't look at the gun; it's doesn't matter. You'll knock it out of their hands before they can use it. Here, this is for you.\" Whatever Courtney's response was, it was too low for him to hear. For his part, Xander felt the rush of adrenaline even as the rest of him stood calm and relaxed, not thinking about anything but waiting for what came through his door.</p>\n\
    <p>And then the green lights went out. And it was so quiet you could hear a vampire breathe. He heard the back door creak open, slightly stuck in the cold, then felt the draft as it was opened. Footsteps, barely there and cautious. No voices or whispers, just the suggestion of sound. A minute passed, or it felt like a minute, but then the dining room door eased open, and Xander held his breath behind it, the swinging door sticking open. He heard the stranger enter but he didn't move far, no more than a couple feet from where he hid. He was waiting for his fellows before moving on. The slight hiss of a radio and the soft whisper of \"dining room clear. Leads to a living room.\"</p>\n\
    <p>And then Kennedy said, \"We're ready,\" and Buffy yelled, \"Now!\" all in his head. The soldier in front of him never knew what hit him. First it was the door, slamming into him as Xander emerged with a burst of energy, then it was the flat of his axe, taking advantage of his moment off balance. In the kitchen he heard the sounds of guns clattering to the floor, and Dawn's battle cry as she distracted the third who had never made it to the hall. In the foyer, crashing and thumping and an \"Ow!\" from Willow and a girly scream from Andrew and more sounds of slayer kicking butt and taking names. Xander rushed into the kitchen to give Dawn a hand. She was sword fighting her guy's gun, mangled at the tip, only holding her own because her blade wouldn't let him close. Xander came up from behind and banged him over the head, knocking him unconscious. Dawn just grinned and together they turned to watch the rest of the fight.</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy's guy was down, a black lump laying wide eyed and shocked against the wall by the fridge. Buffy stared him down. He started to get back to his feet, slowly, painfully, but the Slayer was simply there before he was fully upright and punching him out.</p>\n\
    <p>And Courtney . . . Courtney was on fire. Smaller than Buffy, she fought with the Scythe like the slayer she was. Her guy had regained his gun but it was wrecked beyond usefulness until its only purpose now was to fend of the red weapon of the girl half his size. She couldn't quite get past his guard, not using her full strength, months of holding back working against her as did her size, yet she was just that much quicker, that much ahead of each counter move he made. And suddenly she was there. She faked high and went with a low kick that knocked the soldier back into the wall. Xander winced when he heard the boards crack from the impact. He was down and out for the count. Courtney stared at him in wonder, her breath slowing quickly now that it was over. And silence reigned throughout the house.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked at the three unconscious soldiers on the floor, then up at the pajama squad, Buffy already searching out the duct tape, and felt a twinge of sympathy for the men when they woke up, but it quickly faded.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is that what it's like?\" Courtney broke the silence. She looked at Buffy with wide, amazed eyes, still holding the Scythe ready for battle.</p>\n\
    <p>The older slayer turned and nodded, a slight smile on her face. \"Yeah,\" she said. \"That's what it's like.\"</p>\n\
    <p>And Courtney burst into tears. The Scythe slipped a bit in her grip but she never dropped it. Alarmed, Buffy turned to Xander, but before he could do anything Dawn was there, gently taking the weapon and handing it to her sister before gathering the girl into her arms murmuring nonsense.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm gonna make some hot chocolate,\" said Xander at large. Chocolate solved most problems and he figured that right now it was what everyone needed before even trying to process what had gone down here in the space of, he looked at the oven clock, twenty minutes. He turned the lights on, and Buffy taped up hands and feet before gong off to check on the others. As he busied himself with the water and mugs and extra doses of chocolatey goodness \xE2\x80\x93 tea for Giles \xE2\x80\x93 Xander heard the others' low voices as they decided to put their new prisoners in a corner of the basement in a containment field. Kennedy and Buffy dragged out the four from the kitchen. He heard Velcro rip and metal clank as the soldiers were stripped down to harmlessness then shuffled down the stairs. The scent of burned herbs mixing for the containment spell floated back up, such a natural part of the scene that Xander barely noticed. Everything was ready by the time they came back up.</p>\n\
    <p>Courtney and Dawn trailed in from the living room and they all clustered about the island counter. No one said anything, no one really looked at each other. Except for the odd stake or axe on the white surface it looked like they were at a slumber party. A really quiet and depressed slumber party. Xander decided he was too tired to think about it. In fact he was pretty sure that he was too tired to think at all. They drank their hot chocolate.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's Christmas Eve,\" Dawn said softly, her voice catching in her throat at the unexpected use. Xander glanced over at her where she stood with her arm around Courtney still, a pensive expression on her face as she drained her mug. \"We don't have to do anything with them till after Christmas, right?\" she asked hopefully. But the way she didn't look up said she knew, like they all did, that dealing couldn't wait.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are we still going to the mall tomorrow?\" asked Andrew hesitantly. \"Because I still need to get stuff . . . for people . . . since we didn't go Tuesday . . .\" he trailed off but Buffy smiled at him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And miss the holiday masses?\" she asked a little too brightly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We need to go to the magic shop too,\" added Willow. \"So I can redo, you know, the protection spells.\" She brightened up a little. \"Oooh, and we can get more balsam branches for the hearth. And we forgot to find mistletoe the other day, too,\" she gently whapped Kennedy on the arm for not reminding her before.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Can't forget about that mistletoe,\" agreed Kennedy with her own gentle shove back. Xander smiled, watching as Willow grinned.</p>\n\
    <p>Silence fell once more but this time it was a little lighter. Until Buffy said, \"Willow can you go get your very-truthful stuff?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Veritaserum,\" Dawn corrected her quietly as Willow nodded and went to the dining room where it was kept.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Veritaserum?\" Courtney repeated. \"Like in *Harry Potter*?\" Dawn just beamed and looked smugly at the rest of them, extremely satisfied that another slayer had gotten the reference to the name she had given the truth drops.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep,\" said Dawn.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Cool.\" And for the first time a genuine smile eeked out of the corners of Courtney's lips. The knowledge that the magic of books actually existed and was real finally sunk in in a way that her own power hadn't yet.</p>\n\
    <p>Willow returned a second later with the very-stuff and handed it wordlessly to Buffy. The Slayer looked at the small vile expressionlessly for a moment before leading them to the living room where her guy sat tied to a chair, his head lolling on his chest. Xander wordlessly splashed half of the glass of water he'd grabbed into his face. The shock of cold water had the soldier sputtering back to consciousness. He looked around wildly, taking them all in as he yanked on the rope and tape that held him fast. His eyes that glared defiantly would have been so much more convincing if he hadn't been so disoriented by the sight of a bunch of kids in pajamas.</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy took the glass from Xander and added a couple drops of the truth- maker-teller to the remaining water. \"Drink this,\" she shoved the glass in the soldier's face while he yanked his head away. \"Look, we can do this the easy way or the way with me holding your nose and forcing it down,\" she told him impatiently. When he still made no move to accept she said, \"Xander,\" and he took the glass while she took the soldier's head. A minute of snapping teeth and gagging later and they let him go.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What the hell was that!?\" he demanded, anger finally provoking him to speak. \"And who the hell are you!?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey! Watch your language!\" snapped Xander with a quick look at Courtney. \"We're the ones asking questions here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You won't get anything out of me,\" the man practically growled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What's your name?\" Buffy calmly took over.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ethan Sloan. Captain. 0983745-8332.\" Over by the couch Dawn was taking notes. \"Where's the rest of my team?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy ignored his question. \"Why did you break into our house?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Orders.\" Sloan looked unhappy that he had said anything at all. He was going to fight it. The potion only made someone tell the truth as they knew it, and it did allow a little wiggle room around inexact questions. Good thing Buffy was pretty direct.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And what were your exact orders?\" she asked with a little more steel in her voice. Oh, yeah, she was starting to get impatient. Sloan better start talking if he didn't want the old fashioned Summers treatment.</p>\n\
    <p>\"To extract Alexander Harris and hold him in a safe location until we received orders to release him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Everyone looked at Xander while he just stared at Captain Sloan. Him? They were after him? What the hell? He was of no value, no superpowers, no reason the government would be interested in him. \"Why me?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I didn't question my orders,\" said Sloan with a disdainful glare. Right, soldier, don't ask questions, just do as you're told.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Who do you work for?\" asked Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The NID.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What does that mean?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's a committee.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Commanding officer?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel Howard.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Where are you stationed?\" asked Willow.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Brighton, Ohio.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The questions went on but they didn't learn much more than that besides the hotel they were working out of. Sloan only had his orders; he didn't know any of the reasons behind them. Black ops trained, yes, but that only meant he and his teammates were highly specialized grunts.</p>\n\
    <p>It was about four am when Kennedy and Willow took him back downstairs with the others. Xander was too tired, the late hour and the stress finally making their presence known in the absence of adrenaline. He didn't want to think right now about being a government target. It actually bothered him less than it should have, but that was probably because he was tired. More awake and he'd be freaking out about the implications. Nevertheless, it still took him a long time to fall asleep.</p>\n\
    <p>*********************</p>\n\
    <p>The next morning everyone slept in late. It was almost ten-thirty before Xander and Andrew dragged themselves out of bed and downstairs to the kitchen. Willow and Kennedy were already there making pancakes for everyone, and Giles sat off to the side reading the paper, cup of tea already in hand, looking more awake than necessary. But then, he was still jet lagged so it was no wonder he looked so chipper. Xander contributed to breakfast by putting on the coffee while Andrew was a bit more productive with a skillet and ten eggs. It didn't take too long for the aromas to rouse the other girls from their warm beds and not long after that they were all comfortably seated in the dining room chowing down on scrambles eggs and Mickey Mouse pancakes.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So research all day?\" asked Willow once the initial feeding frenzy calmed a little.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Quite,\" said Giles. \"The sooner we find out why the government wants Xander the better. And we need to know how much they know about slayers.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We should probably contact Riley, too,\" said Buffy. \"See if the Initiative is behind this.\" But she didn't sound very convinced of that, and with good reason. The Initiative if anything, stayed out of their way, especially now that Riley seemed to be one of the top dogs of the program. In fact, his housewarming gift had been a check with a good six zeroes on it that had gotten them through the first year of traveling and training slayers. But it looked like the rest of the government hadn't gotten the memo.</p>\n\
    <p>So why him? he wondered again. If the government wanted slayers, the only thing he was good for as a hostage was pissing them off. Besides, it would actually do no good because Willow would just magic him away, no problem, since military bases probably didn't have a magical signature much less protection. And you didn't hear about slayers without hearing about The Witch. So what was up with the Xander kidnapping? It only made sense if they didn't know and if they didn't know why were the attacking? Why would anyone care about just him?</p>\n\
    <p>And then it hit him like a punch to the gut, so hard that he forgot to chew and ended up choking on his eggs.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander?\" asked Dawn giving him a pat on the back while the others looked at him curiously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It could be Jack,\" he said once he regained his breath. Though it still felt like his breath was coming in gasps because Jack wouldn't, would he? \"He works for a classified project. And he's been . . . but I don't think he'd try to kidnap me.\" Jack was more the let's scream-at-each-other-until- we-settle-it type. He wouldn't do something like this. He cared too much about wanting the father-son thing to work, surely he wouldn't throw it all away to curiosity. But doubts flitted around in his head because, well, there were eight black ops soldiers in the basement.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We'll find out,\" said Willow dangerously. And Xander was suddenly grateful, once again, that she was on their side. And God help Jack if he was behind this. But he wouldn't be, would he? Xander desperately wanted him not to be. He wanted it to be some rogue group of the Initiative or something, anything other than Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So Willow and Dawn, you two okay for computer duty?\" asked Buffy and the two nodded. \"Me and Kennedy will go by their hotel room, see what we find there. Xander, you can get in touch with Riley? See what he knows?\" Xander nodded. \"Giles \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll help out here,\" he said. \"We need to reset the wards as well.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay. When Kennedy and I get back, we'll go to the mall,\" Buffy forced a smile that no one really returned.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So should I make more pancakes?\" asked Andrew, drawing Xander's attention to the plate that held a remaining three. No one made any move to claim them, but before he could point out the obvious, Andrew went on, \"for the prisoners, I mean . . . or we could starve them,\" he suggested when he only received blank stares.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think I vote for the starving plan,\" said Kennedy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Seconded,\" said Dawn.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So no pancakes?\" asked Andrew. \"And I don't have to make Christmas dinner for them, do I? Because that, like, doubles what I was planning and I'd have to put on my kelvar and face the soccer mom's at Kroger's. That'd be like sending Neo against all the Agent Smiths and their kids. You're not going to make me do that are you?\" And Andrew looked so pathetic and terrified that Xander couldn't help but grin at the thought of him fighting off a hundred housewives with a stick of bread.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think they'll survive on pancakes,\" Xander reassured him. No need to go out of their way for the bad guys. If they were anything but human . . . he sighed. Stupid morals.</p>\n\
    <p>Once everyone had finished eating, they broke up to go get dressed and get on with their assigned tasks. Willow and Dawn quickly took over the dining room table with their laptops and scramblers and other hacking equipment. Xander grinned to himself when Courtney gummed up to Dawn, listening raptly as the young watcher explained how they were going to break into some of the most secure computers in the country. The girl had a bad a case of hero worship going on. Giles was in the kitchen with a book and supplies for the wards while Andrew did the dishes. Xander grabbed the phone and the official address book and started trying to track down Riley.</p>\n\
    <p>The day passed rather anticlimactically as research days often did. Xander ended up taking Andrew and Courtney to Home Depot with him while they were still waiting for Buffy and Kennedy to get back. He needed to fix the battered kitchen wall and part of the banister of the stairs that had gotten broken in the attack. Willow and Dawn were deep into their search for information \xE2\x80\x93 Willow having taken a quick break to do the protection spells with Giles \xE2\x80\x93 and barely noticed anyone else around them. Giles was actually helping them by organizing the scattered information they dug up and reading some dusty book when he wasn't needed.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander had just started prying off the broken boards in the kitchen when the slayers returned with lots of nifty military toys but little useful information. Half an hour later they left for the mall and last minute shopping, mostly for Courtney. Xander made sure they stopped by the local magic shop on the way home. The best magic shop in Cleveland was no Magic Box. The owner was a New Age \"believer\" with three kids and a love affair with incense who thought she sold nothing more than health crystals and herbs. Giles had a supplier up in Chicago who gave him discount prices on bulk orders on their more obvious magical supplies, but for basics and mistletoe, it was good enough.</p>\n\
    <p>The rest of the afternoon was spent wrapping presents and watching Christmas specials on tv. Xander worked on the kitchen wall, keeping both his hands and mind occupied. Willow and Dawn were still working, but from the mixed sounds that kept echoing form the dining room, they were making progress. Andrew fixed grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner and distributed them with Christmas cookies to everyone scattered about.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander?\" he came up a few minutes after hi initial pass. He held a plate of pancakes with red and green m&amp;m smiley faces. \"We should feed the evil army of darkness,\" he said, shifting uncomfortably. But Xander just nodded, understanding. He set down his screwdriver and followed Andrew to the basement. It was a large, finished basement that stretched under the whole house. The stairs opened into a den with couches and another tv. False cubicle-like walls partitioned off 'rooms' next to the real outer wall, each one containing two sets of bunk beds that housed slayers during the summer. There were two bathrooms at either end. The soldiers had been sealed in two of the rooms, one on each side of the green bathroom with a little strip outside the doors so they could walk between the two rooms and get to the facilities.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you sure it's just kids?\" he heard one of them say from the room on the left.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" another sighed, Sloan, and from the way he said it Xander could tell they'd been going over it all day long. \"Kids in floral pajamas and bathrobes.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"The girl who got me looked about ten,\" said another glum voice.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I still don't believe it,\" the first guy replied. And Xander felt a perverse set of pleasure that these government issued lethal weapons just got their asses kicked by a bunch of girls and dorks.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Better believe it, buddy,\" Xander called out crossing his arms across his chest, coming to a stop just beyond the invisible line. Silence from within, then all eight emerged crammed in the little space Willow had allowed them. None of them tried to push forward; they knew exactly where the bars of their cage lay. \"Captain Sloan,\" Xander nodded to the one he recognized.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Mr. Harris,\" Sloan acknowledged him tightly. \"What do you want?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shrugged toward Andrew. \"Though you might be hungry,\" he said. Andrew shifted forward and pushed the plate of pancakes through the barrier, waiting nervously while Sloan just looked at it. \"No, thanks.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Suit yourself,\" Xander didn't care one way or another and he turned to go.</p>\n\
    <p>He waited for Andrew to set the plate on the floor. \"It's not drugged or poisoned or anything,\" said Andrew. \"Just happy faces, see? And if you want milk or kool-aid, I think we have grape left . . . and, uh, well . . . Merry Christmas.\" The soldiers looked at each other then back at Andrew, unsure what to make of him or the pancakes. But when Xander glanced at them from the foot of the stairs, he saw Sloan pick up the plate and take it back inside with them.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander wondered if they had families waiting for them back home. And he remembered the look on Jack's face, worried and scared. For him, not wanting him to be in danger, needing to understand. When he reached the kitchen, Xander grabbed the phone instead of his tools. But Jack wasn't home.</p>\n\
    <p>***************************</p>\n\
    <p>\"So the NID has two parts, good and bad. The bad part is what we're dealing with and it has a lot of really secret projects,\" said Willow later that night. It was around eleven and everyone was seated around the dining room table with a glass of wine except for Courtney who had purple kool- aid. \"They recruit most of their agents from the military and what they all have in common is a somewhat flexible morality.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"In other words, people who have no problems kidnapping an American citizen on Christmas Eve?\" said Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Pretty much,\" Dawn nodded. \"Anyway, we found Colonel Howard in Brighton and after a little computer magic \xE2\x80\x93 mine not Willow's \xE2\x80\x93 we found the guy who gave him his orders from Washington. That guy, Kielly, oversees a project called Area 51 in Nevada.\" Dawn paused and waited for a reaction. Which she got.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Area 51?\" repeated Andrew. \"There's really an Area 51? That is so cool!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're going to tell us aliens are real aren't you?\" asked Kennedy who was watching Willow who shrugged.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It looks like a research center. Weapons and planes and stuff. There wasn't any real stuff in the files we found. It was mostly administrative paperwork. No top secret anything was on the computers other than tell us it was top secret. We checked, even cheating,\" she ducked her head about using magic.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And these NID people are in charge of it?\" asked Giles. \"These weapons projects?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" Dawn jumped back in. \"They just have their people there. Like spies. Kielly isn't in charge of Area 51, he's in charge of the rogue NID keeping an eye on it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Like a KGB CIA office,\" said Andrew.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sort of . But we don't think Kielly was the top guy giving orders. But there's no electronic trial to follow so we don't know who the top guy is,\" she gave her sister an apologetic glance.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what does this weapons stuff have to do with me?\" asked Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay, so here's where we really had to do some digging,\" said Willow as if what they had already discovered was barely anything. \"While we were poking around Area 51 we found invoices from an Area 52 but all we knew was that it's another base somewhere. Then we started looking into Jack again and whatever he's into. And we found out that he works at Area 52, which is run by the Air Force.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Wait,\" Xander searched for words, sure he was making the wrong connections but . . . \"You're saying that Jack works at the place that's sending weapons stuff to Area 51?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Willow answered. \"We couldn't find out much of what they do there. We think their sensitive computers are an isolated network like the ones at Area 51, but the ones that were hooked up to the internet had some interesting archeological stuff on them, which was kind of weird. Some of the cultures they were looking at are ancient.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And from all over the world,\" added Giles. \"South America, the Middle East, Europe, China, everywhere.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And they took us *forever* to get into,\" said Dawn. \"Even with Willow cheating.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It took me a while to figure out how I needed to get around some stuff,\" the redhead blushed. \"Whoever designed the system was *good,* really good, some of the best protection I've seen. Which just made it harder because you gotta be careful with the magic technology mixing. That and we didn't want them to know we were there.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So, this and Xander?\" asked Kennedy to get them back to the point.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, we're not sure,\" Dawn traced the edge of her wineglass with a finger. \"When we went back to the NID computers the only stuff we had that connected was a file on Jack and some other people at Area 52. They don't have anything else on the place really. It's always referred to as Area 52 or Project Bluebook or the SGC but nothing on what it actually is. It's like they don't keep that info where hackers can get to it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's probably all nice and neat in some hard copy somewhere,\" Willow sighed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right, so this it what we have,\" said Buffy. \"The people who want Xander spy on a place that gets weapons stuff from the place where Jack works. Do they spy on the 52 place too?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"There aren't any agents there,\" Willow shook her head.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So maybe that's what they want,\" said Andrew. \"Agents there.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So why don't they just put them there?\" asked Courtney as if it were obvious, but Xander thought he saw what Andrew meant.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Because maybe they can't,\" he said. \"The Air Force has control of Area 52. If it's so secretive that magic can only get us into the least dangerous computers, then maybe they don't want people with stretchable morals in charge. Maybe it's like when Riley joined us to stop Maggie Walsh only before Adam got made.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So the NID wants you so they can force Jack, your dad, to let them in,\" finished Dawn. \"That sounds like my life.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack wouldn't kidnap me,\" said Xander confidently now. And he realized that he was relieved by this alternate hypothesis. Greatly relieved. And at the same time pissed off that he'd gotten dragged into some government power struggle, especially now since the eight commandos knew that something was up with them. How much time did they have before the government sent more people to find out what had happened to their people they had already sent? How did he tell Jack about the attack without him asking how they had defeated the team? He was already asking enough questions. And now he worked for a secret weapons project? But if Jack were preventing the NID people from taking over, then could he prevent them or others like them from getting their hands on the slayers?</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what now?\" asked Kennedy. \"'Cause we can't just keep eight commandos as pets.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander?\" Buffy turned to him, open and waiting to follow his lead on this one.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm gonna call Jack,\" he said slowly. \"He at least deserves to know about the NID. But he's gonna have questions.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Perhaps we should treat him like any other parent,\" suggested Giles watching Xander closely for any reaction. \"Bring him here and explain things to him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He works for a weapons project for the military,\" Xander couldn't help but say, though part of him wanted to do just that. \"And you want to tell him about superpowerful girls fighting the forces of darkness?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You know him best,\" Giles conceded. \"But we'll have tell him something. And I'd much prefer it to be here where we can control the situation than in some other unsavory place.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander knew he was right, especially with the rate Jack was noticing things. Jack kept saying he came first, right? Looked like now he would see just how far he was willing to go. Xander only hoped his gut feeling panned out, but at the same time he couldn't help but wonder how well he really knew the man who was his father.</p>\n\
    <p>***************************</p>\n\
    <p>Jack stopped short when he entered the briefing room late in the afternoon on Christmas Day. He and SG-1 had just gotten back from their recon mission two hours ago and he had thought that the holiday couldn't get any worse, but here was worse standing in front of him in the form of Kinsey's aide all dressed up in a suit and tie. General Hammond did not look happy.  No sir, not happy at all.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah, Colonel O'Neill, Merry Christmas. It's nice to see you again,\" the aide whose name Jack had not remembered the first time they had met smiled cheerily.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The pleasure's all yours, I'm sure,\" Jack answered with a not so sunny smile of his own. His feet regained the ability to walk and went and sat in his customary chair by the general. His team followed flickering looks back and forth amongst themselves, asking each other what new crap was about to hit the fan.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Charming as usual,\" said the aide.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Mr. Freyland has a proposal for us from Vice-President-elect Kinsey,\" said General Hammond. Who was still as far away from happy as a suicider.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Mr. Kinsey feels that you have served your country well over the last several years and deserve a nice rest,\" Freyland smiled condescendingly. \"I'm sure you've been looking forward to retirement, Colonel.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I have, have I?\" Jack couldn't believe this. Kinsey couldn't force him into retirement. Who did he think he was?</p>\n\
    <p>\"How is your son doing, Colonel?\" asked Freyland. \"I understand he lives in Cleveland?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack's blood ran cold. \"You son of a bitch!\" Jack was on his feet and only Daniel's quick reflexes kept him from jumping the table and throttling the smug bastard on the other side of the table.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Mr. Freyland,\" Hammond began but the slime cut him off smoothly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"General I believe your family is missing you today as well. Colonel, I'm sure you would like to talk to your son. Here's the number.\" He slid a piece of paper across the table to him. \"I'll be here tomorrow to pick up those papers.\" And with another smug smile, he left.</p>\n\
    <p>\"General \xE2\x80\x93 \" said Jack, shaking off Daniel's hands.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Use my office,\" Hammond told him.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack practically ran and grabbed the phone, his fingers fumbling over the numbers while his mind skipped over any number of horrible things that could be happening to Xander at this moment. Dial tone, then an automated message informing him that the number he had called did not have a voice mailbox that was set up. Which brought Jack up short because that wasn't how these things worked. Something was seriously wrong here. Had Freyland given him the wrong number? But that didn't seem likely because that's not how these people worked. They wanted you to know that they had your son in their possession and that they could and would do anything to him to get your cooperation. They didn't send cocky young aides to bluff.</p>\n\
    <p>Maybe someone on the inside was helping him out? Jack dialed his home voicemail. Please let there be someone helping him out. He couldn't think about what else a silent phone might mean. \"There are . . . five . . .new messages,\" said the recording. \"To listen to your messages press one.\" Jack did so. \"First message. Eight thirty-six pm, yesterday: Hey Jack, it's me,\" his son's voice took over. He sounded normal, like nothing was wrong. \"I just . . . um . . . Merry Christmas, Jack. Just wanted to . . . you know, tell you. I guess that's it. Bye.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Not kidnapped then, thought Jack as he punched through to the next message.  \"Second message. Eleven twenty-two pm, yesterday: Jack, it's me,\" his son's voice again but less unsure. Jack felt a little tension creep away. \"Look . . . we need to talk. So call me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Talk. He sounded serious but not frightened or anxious. That was last night. He was okay last night. \"Third message. Six oh-three am, today: Jack, where the hell are you?\" And Xander was not happy. But still not scared. \"It's Christmas morning. Aren't you supposed to be up by now? I really need to talk to you. Like yesterday. Call me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>That was this morning. Safe and angry at him for not answering. \"Fourth message. Eight forty-one, today: Jack,\" Xander's voice was agitated. \"If I said I've got eight NID agents in my basement would you give me a call?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack's heart stopped. He didn't just say . . . He replayed the message and established that he wasn't hearing things. How the hell did Xander get eight NID agents in his basement? He played the final message. \"Fifth message. Two fourteen, today: So I get it, you're not home. Probably off eating chicken or something. Did you get my last message? Cause they're still there, and we're running out of pancake mix. We really need to talk.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Stunned, Jack returned to the briefing room. His teammates and General Hammond all stopped talking and looked at him. \"So Xander's safe,\" he said with a calm that he did not feel. \"And apparently he has eight NID agents in his basement.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Eight \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"NID agents in his basement,\" Jack finished Daniel's sentence. \"Sir, I know we've got a lot going on here but request permission \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Granted,\" said General Hammond. \"And take SG-1 with you. I understand he's your son, but please remember that there are issues of national security at stake. The higher ups . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Understood, sir,\" Jack nodded. He turned to his team who were still surprised by the news, even Teal'c's eyebrows seemed higher on his forehead then usual.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And Colonel, I want to know how your son was able to subdue eight specially trained operatives,\" said the General. He nodded again before determinedly leaving with his team. Jack wanted to know too. And he was sure as hell going to find out.</p>\n\
    <p>***************************** * *</p>\n\
    <p>AN: I know the NID stuff isn't quite accurate but it makes it much more interesting my way. Can't just give Willow all the answers!</p>\n\
    <p>So is the plot thickening enough for you guys? 'Cause it ain't over yet.</p>\n\

      <p>Vendor-specific proprietary extensions to this specification are
      strongly discouraged. Documents must not use such extensions, as
      doing so reduces interoperability and fragments the user base,
      allowing only users of specific user agents to access the content in
      question.</p>
    
      <p>If vendor-specific markup extensions are needed, they should be
      done using XML, with elements or attributes from custom
      namespaces. If such DOM extensions are needed, the members should be
      prefixed by vendor-specific strings to prevent clashes with future
      versions of this specification. Extensions must be defined so that
      the use of extensions neither contradicts nor causes the
      non-conformance of functionality defined in the specification.</p>
      &lt;!-- thanks to QA Framework -->
    
      <div class="example">
    
       <p>For example, while strongly discouraged from doing so, an
       implementation "Foo Browser" could add a new IDL attribute "<code title="">fooTypeTime</code>" to a control's DOM interface that
       returned the time it took the user to select the current value of a
       control (say). On the other hand, defining a new control that
       appears in a form's <code title="dom-form-elements"><a href="#dom-form-elements">elements</a></code>
       array would be in violation of the above requirement, as it would
       violate the definition of <code title="dom-form-elements"><a href="#dom-form-elements">elements</a></code> given in this
       specification.</p>
    
      </div>
    
      <hr><p>When vendor-neutral extensions to this specification are needed,
      either this specification can be updated accordingly, or an
      extension specification can be written that overrides the
      requirements in this specification. When someone applying this
      specification to their activities decides that they will recognise
      the requirements of such an extension specification, it becomes an

    Section 20: Galley Philosophy<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>The kitchen was a wreck when Daniel, Sam, and Aeryn found it. It took them until the ship was almost right to get everything cleaned up, so they went ahead and fixed dinner for everyone. Daniel was surprised that there was so little food left from the first aborted attempt at a meal, but Aeryn explained that Rygel had probably eaten some if it in the stress of the attack.</p>
    <p>The first thing Aeryn asked them was if they could cook. Sam, with an unapologetic smile had politely begged off leaving Daniel in charge of feeding ten people.</p>
    <p>"You know, in almost every culture, cooking is a part of the woman's domain," Daniel told them as he picked out steaks from the fridge. "Even among modern egalitarian societies, originally cooking was the woman's job."</p>
    <p>"Well in our modern egalitarian society, I order out," Sam replied.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, we noticed," Daniel smiled at her. Both he and Jack had a more extensive culinary repertoire than Sam did, and while spaghetti was good, it was still spaghetti. Sidestepping Sam's swat at his arm before it could do any damage, Daniel turned to Aeryn. "So I guess you guys rotate through kitchen duty?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn shrugged where her back was visible from the pantry. "When we eat together." She turned with a bag of mixed vegetables. "Lately, we've mostly been feeding just ourselves."</p>
    <p>"Too much trouble?" said Sam.</p>
    <p>Aeryn half smiled. "No one wanted to eat with Scorpius or Sikozu. Or Rygel. Or Norianti sometimes. And some of us were avoiding each other."</p>
    <p>"Who were you avoiding?" asked Sam curiously.</p>
    <p>Aeryn looked at her a moment before saying, "I wasn't. He was."</p>
    <p>"John?" Sam guessed with sympathy.</p>
    <p>Aeryn nodded and added, "It was more complicated than just our problems. Though they were pretty substantial."</p>
    <p>"But you're in the same place with the same people all the time and you need a break from it," Sam finished, nodding. "I know what you mean."</p>
    <p>"Hey," said Daniel, pretending to be hurt. "Are you saying we're bad company?"</p>
    <p>"I'm saying you're my only company," Sam shot back playfully. "You know I have almost no friends outside of work?"</p>
    <p>Daniel thought about it for a moment before nodding and acknowledging that all his friends were work related too, and all his close ones he practically lived with on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>"How long have you been working together?" asked Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"Six years?" Sam hazarded a guess. "Then there was the year you were gone." Daniel nodded. A lot had happened since he had opened the stargate. Sha'uri, Apophis, murder, mayhem, and new planets. They'd saved the planet countless times, and lost a lot of good people to the fight against the Goa'uld.</p>
    <p>"Why did you leave?" Aeryn asked, drawing him back to the present.</p>
    <p>"I was, uh, ascended to a higher state of existence," said Daniel. He looked over his shoulder for her reaction and was rewarded with a look of surprise.</p>
    <p>"You? You're human." She said it like it was an impossibility.</p>
    <p>Daniel shrugged with a smile and flipped over the steaks. "At the time it was something I needed to do."</p>
    <p>"Where did you go?"</p>
    <p>"Oh I was still around. I don't remember much of that time. I was . . . energy with a conscious I guess you could say."</p>
    <p>Aeryn nodded. "You should talk to Stark. He's energy."</p>
    <p>"Stark?" asked Sam as surprised as Daniel was by this pronouncement. Daniel had barely seen the masked man; he was jittery around them, wary of getting too close.</p>
    <p>"His physical form is real, and he's attached to it, but he can exist without it," Aeryn explained. "His mask covers the opening where his energy comes out."</p>
    <p>"Why does he keep it covered?" asked Sam.</p>
    <p>"To keep the rest of us safe from it. He can drive someone mad or calm the down."</p>
    <p>"I guess we'd fit right in here," Daniel observed. Both Aeryn and Sam looked over at him. "Driving people mad I mean. Well, that and me and Stark being energy. And you two being soldiers. And you and John knowing physics." Daniel frowned and stopped, a half dozen more similarities jumping into his head. It was uncanny. At the table the two women just smiled knowingly at each other in that way of women that was completely universal. They were talking about him without talking, and they barely knew each other. "Anyway," he tried diverting attention away from himself.  "Have you decided what you're going to do with the wedding?"</p>
    <p>"Wedding?" Sam leapt on the change in subject. "I thought you were already married."</p>
    <p>"No, not yet," Aeryn smiled.</p>
    <p>"But," Sam paused and glanced from Aeryn to Daniel and back again.</p>
    <p>"But what?" asked Aeryn with a confused smile.</p>
    <p>"But, the way you act together. I just assumed . . ." Sam answered with a shrug. But Daniel caught the split second hesitation when his teammate changed what she was going to say. Whatever it was, he would have to ask about it later. "So when's the big day?"</p>
    <p>"Soon," said Aeryn. "Probably after we figure out how to get you home to your reality and when Chiana is well enough."</p>
    <p>"Yeah, I bet she'll really want to be there."</p>
    <p>"So what kind of customs do your people have?" asked Daniel. Earlier he and Jack had been kept busy answering questions about Earth traditions. The colonel had for once been the talker, expounding on what he knew and ignoring the questions Daniel had about Aeryn's own people.</p>
    <p>"My species?" Aeryn asked.</p>
    <p>Daniel nodded yes, "Or your specific culture. Are there many of them?"</p>
    <p>"Daniel, let her answer the first question," Sam admonished him gently.</p>
    <p>"I don't know," said Aeryn. "I was born a Peacekeeper and they don't have weddings or marriages, or even prolonged relationships. I know the colonies have marriages and families, but I don't know anything about them."</p>
    <p>"And the Peacekeepers is your . . . military society?" asked Daniel and Aeryn nodded. Not really surprised, he immediately thought of the Spartans in Ancient Greece and the story where a boy stoically let a baby fox he had found eat out his insides so that the teachers wouldn't discover that he had broken the rules. "That must have been rough growing up in that kind of environment."</p>
    <p>"I didn't know anything else," Aeryn shrugged. "It wasn't until I'd left that I knew what had been stolen from me. Like wedding plans." She forced a smile. Taking the hint, Daniel decided not to press. Curious as he was, nothing hinged on painful memories she wasn't willing to discuss. "I think we'll simply make our promises in the Den with the crew. We certainly can't go buy those fancy white dresses you were talking about."</p>
    <p>"Hey! I smell food!" Around the corner strode Jack with the rest of Moya's denizens. D'argo and Stark were helping Chiana along, who looked a little better than the last time Daniel had seen her. Rygel followed behind them, and Teal'c, he noticed, kept a wary eye on Norianti from the opposite side of the corridor.</p>
    <p>"What's this I hear about dresses? You want one?" asked John as he and Rygel swooped in to check on the food. Daniel frowned at both of them, slightly offended that they didn't trust his cooking abilities, and waved them over to the table.</p>
    <p>"No, I don't like dresses," Aeryn replied as John sat down beside her.</p>
    <p>"You look damn sexy in them," he shot back. She just gave him a look that could melt iron. "I know, I know," John waved a hand, "can't kick, can't punch, and can't hide a knife worth grabbing. What if we made special pockets?"</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>"We could pretend we were Betazoid and go naked."</p>
    <p>"No."</p>
    <p>"I could just bang you over the head." Again, Aeryn simply glared, though Daniel was sure he saw the glimmer of a grin. "I know," John said with an exaggerated sigh. "You can kick my ass from here into next week before I even know what hit me."</p>
    <p>"You're lucky I'm marrying you at all."</p>
    <p>The way he looked at her then left no doubt that he was head over heels for her. "I know."</p>
    <p>"Oh please!" Rygel broke the moment impatiently. "Let's eat before I lose my appetite to all this disgusting mush."</p>
    <p>"Like you would ever lose your appetite," said D'argo sarcastically.</p>
    <p>"I'll have you know - "</p>
    <p>"Yeah, yeah," "Shut up," at least three people said before the diminutive alien could get going. From his vantagepoint as cook at the stove, Daniel took a moment to just watch everyone as conversation started up. Rygel was still arguing with John about his appetite while the human split his attention between him and Aeryn and Chiana who had asked about the wedding and the baby. Baby? Daniel pulled up short in surprise before chuckling to himself.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the table, Jack was trying to explain hockey to D'argo while Sam made unhelpful comments. Beside them, Teal'c, Stark, and Norianti were having a conversation about death that wasn't helped by Noranti's translations or the non-sequitors that seemed to pop out of nowhere.</p>
    <p>It was amazing how well they got along considering the very short time they had known each other. Well, maybe not so amazing in light of one rescue, two battles, and nearly exploding - all in less than two days. But Daniel felt it was more than that. He thought back over the similarities he had spouted off earlier to Sam and Aeryn. They were both diverse groups with colorful people who were often at odds with each other, but at the same time as close as family. It was a different dynamic than that of an all military team, and perhaps that was what they recognized in each other.</p>
    <p>This motley crew was different than what they normally ran into offworld, that was for certain. And when John spoke up to Pilot, Daniel smiled at the reminder that the ship and her navigator were included in this tightly knit group. He knew then that this was one of the missions that would stay with him and keep him going through the stargate when the wonder wore away to banality. As he dished up the steaks and joined the rest at the table, Daniel thought of the opener from the Star Trek he had watched with Teal'c: "to seek out new life and new civilizations." Well, Moya and her people certainly didn't make up a civilization, far from it, but life . . .more than that. They were truly alive.</p>

    <p>AN: To all of you out there reading my little story, you rock! I am completely blown away by the reviews you guys keep sending me. Your support and observations definitely keep the pressure on. Special thanks go to rachel for spotting a spelling problems. I'm self beta-ing and with twenty pages plus, I certainly don't catch everything. Thank you all so much for being patient with me. I know it takes updates a few weeks to get out, but I really am writing as fast as I can.</p>\n\
    <hr>Nine Lives of Scary Cats<p>Jack shut the engine off and looked at the house in trepidation. It was covered in snow with Christmas lights in the trees and a wreath on the front door like every other house on the block in the quiet neighborhood. The early morning light reflected brightly off of everything as if nothing were wrong, making the whole situation feel surreal. It was just after eight, December twenty-sixth, and Jack couldn't help but feel very tired.</p>\n\
    <p>Honestly, he didn't know what to expect. His phone call to Xander last night had been terse and to the point. His son hadn't wanted to discuss anything over the phone, just requested that he come and offered to pick him up from the airport, but that hadn't been necessary. Jack and his teammates had flown cargo out of Peterson late last night and been issued an SUV at the base about forty miles outside of Cleveland. And here they were. Jack felt a strong revulsion to going in because that would mean that this was really happening and Xander really had gotten pulled into his dangerous world.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack,\" Daniel prodded from the backseat. Jack nodded and sighed, getting out of the car. The path to the front door was clear and sprinkled with salt that crunched beneath their feet. Daniel found the doorbell easily enough beside him when they reached the top of the steps, and it was only a minute before Dawn answered the door.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack!\" she said, clearly surprised to see him there so early. \"And friends,\" equally startled by the three additional people.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Dawn,\" Jack greeted the young woman. She was still in her floral print pajamas with heavy socks covering her feet.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We thought you were coming later,\" she said, stepping back to let them in.</p>\n\
    <p>Everything looked just the same as Jack remembered it except for the decorations and the stack of wood that sat by the staircase waiting to repair the damage to the banister. The sight of it an unpleasant reminder that all was not well. Off to the left, Jack could hear the tv from the den.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Everyone else is still asleep except for Courtney and Giles. They should be up soon though. Jackets and snow boots off,' Dawn pointed to the coat rack next to the door and the rows of shoes underneath. Once they wouldn't spoil the carpet, she led them around to the den. A modest sized Christmas tree sat in the corner and wrapping paper still seemed to cling to everything. Decorations of every kind were on every available surface, from cute plastic elves to a Menorah to odd wooden and candles. The little girl Xander had brought to his house barely a week earlier sat curled up under an afghan on the couch watching cartoons, and nearby Rupert Giles sat in an armchair with a book. Both looked up when they entered the latter getting slowly to his feet to greet them.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel O'Neill,\" the Englishman offered his hand after a moment, which Jack shook briskly. He looked curiously at the others behind him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah, Rupert Giles, I'd like t you to meet some colleagues of mine. Major Carter, Dr. Jackson, and Murray.\" Giles shook each of their hands with a polite smile as if visitors at nine in the morning the day after Christmas were completely normal.</p>\n\
    <p>\"A pleasure to meet you,\" he said. \"I'm afraid the others aren't awake yet.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's what Dawn said,\" Jack nodded toward the teenager who was coolly looking over his team. Carter and Daniel both shifted uncomfortably under the scrutiny while Teal'c simply lifted an eyebrow in her direction. Dawn, Jack was surprised to see, met him stare for stare.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I can go wake them up,\" Dawn told them after a distracted second. \"Though you will so owe me for this,\" she said turning from Teal'c to Giles. The older man merely nodded, a pensive look on his face while she disappeared.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Would you like some tea or coffee?\" he offered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Coffee would be great,\" Daniel spoke up, and Giles nodded and went to the kitchen leaving them the four of them alone with Courtney and the cartoons. Jack turned to his teammates to see what they thought of things so far. After a quick exchange of silent 'guess we wait and see' looks, Daniel, predictably, wandered over to the bookshelf by the tree and Teal'c over to the collection of movies. A statue of a naked woman with tree branches extending from her outstretched arms and hair, her feet melding into roots \xE2\x80\x93 and plastic miniature ornaments on every branch that clearly had not come with the statue \xE2\x80\x93 had caught Carter's eye, and now Jack's. He remembered Xander saying something about how Willow was sort of pagan.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's an Earth symbol,\" Courtney surprised them both by saying. She was watching them look at the statue with clear eyes and an empty expression. \"Willow says it's to remind us that we're part of the Earth and the Earth is part of us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And the ornaments?\" Jack couldn't help but ask, flicking a small plastic snowman with his finger.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It represents our culture,\" said Courtney. \"Since our culture's part of who we are, it's part of the Earth too. I think it looks pretty.\" Jack personally thought it looked tacky, but who was he to argue? He was about to make some bland comment about it for conversation's sake but Courtney beat him too it. \"Thanks for letting me stay over that time,\" she said. \"I know you were kind of mad about it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wasn't mad,\" Jack interrupted. He came over and sat on the couch beside her. She watched him with that same beguiling stare of the young and suddenly Jack didn't know how to explain. \"Just . . . surprised.\" Surprised, confused \xE2\x80\x93 and Jack still didn't know what had been going on, was still going on. \"I'm sorry about your house,\" he said, remembering it had burned. The sudden welling of tears in Courtney's eyes only confirmed why she was here and not with her own family. Another thing Jack was going to grill Xander about when he got down here.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did you get anything good for Christmas?\" asked Carter in an effort to distract Courtney, who smiled weakly and nodded in return. Jack listened halfheartedly while she and Carter chatted Harry Potter books and clothing. The unsettled feeling was back and with it impatience. Jack just wanted to get to the answers right now. Enough of this waiting and wondering. He stood to pace off some of his sudden energy but luckily Giles returned with a coffeepot and four mugs before he drove everyone nuts.</p>\n\
    <p>Giles set about pouring but Jack didn't really notice because just then Xander walked in with Dawn and her sister Buffy. His son had taken time to pull on jeans and a sweatshirt though his hair was still tousled from sleep. Dawn too had changed; she and Buffy were both in the same kind of casual warm clothes meant for hanging around the house, but Jack only noticed them peripherally.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Busy holiday?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Jack didn't know what to say to the penetrating stare that wanted to know why he'd been absent on Christmas Day. \"So you had some visitors?\" he asked lightly to open up the subject.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Xander nodded, breaking eye contact and looking over Jack's shoulder at the others. \"And I see you brought friends.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" Giles interrupted the tense atmosphere. \"Xander, why don't you and Jack go talk in the sitting room. And Dawn you might want to clean up the dining room a little bit so we can eat in there later?\" He lifted his eyebrows and Dawn's eyes opened wide and darted to Jack before she hurried off. Great, more secrets, thought Jack, wondering just what it was they were hiding in the dining room. And he was tired of it all. Just tired of double talk and silence, and he was sick of doing this by their rules.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why don't we just talk here,\" he suggested instead, anger just held in check. \"You all know what's going on. We're all going to find out. Let's just get it in the open right here.\" He looked from Giles to Xander, challenging either one to disagree. He wasn't disappointed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"This is between you and me right now,\" said Xander. And the uncertainty Jack saw in Xander's face for one unguarded moment decided him. Remembered words from that awful night \xE2\x80\x93 people to protect, don't trust who you work for . . . The conflicting mysteries hadn't added up to anything he or his team could figure out on the flight over. But whatever it was, it was important to Xander, something that he didn't trust the government with \xE2\x80\x93 which actually scared Jack. And it looked like Xander was about to tell him anyway.</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right,\" Jack agreed. He exchanged a look with his team, but none of them protested, only nodded in understanding. So Jack followed Xander to the sitting room where they had first talked on that summer day half a year ago. He felt like he was meeting his son for the first time again, which he supposed he was in a way.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So,\" he said, once they were seated opposite each other, the door firmly closed behind them. \"You really have eight NID agents in your basement?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander nodded, unsmiling. \"Yeah. I'll take you down later.\" He looked down at his hands then back up. \"So, this isn't how I normally do this,\" he said. \"But with the NID wanting something from you, and me being a convenient target, and me being Mr. North America to people that the government would probably like to experiment on, all adds up to bad.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" Jack closed his eyes briefly, wondering just how he did it, \"one more time. In English. With coherent sentences.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I need to know that what I'm about to tell you won't get passed on to your CO or anyone else where you work,\" said Xander sitting up and leaning forward so his elbows rested on his knees. \"I'm telling you because you're my father and if we keep seeing each other you're going to find out anyway.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm going to have to tell my team,\" said Jack after a moment. \"Daniel, Carter, and Murray. I've told them enough already, but you can trust them.\" Xander didn't look too surprised by that; he probably had suspected it the moment he saw SG-1 in the den with Jack. \"And I have to tell my CO.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You remember General Hammond?\" Jack spoke over him, raising a hand to ward off protest. \"Yesterday we got an ultimatum from some people who want control over our project,\" he said carefully. Xander deserved to know after all, since they had tried to use him as a pawn. A part of Jack was perversely proud that his pawn had teeth.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The NID.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, they just used the NID,\" said Jack. \"They gave me a number to call, where you were supposedly. The phone was off and then I got your messages. Hammond was there for that and wants answers as much as I do.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Then I don't know if I can tell you,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You can trust Hammond,\" said Jack. \"He's a good man and one of the best commanders I've had. Ever. I can promise it won't go beyond the five of us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's reassuring,\" Xander's voice dripped with sarcasm. \"And how do I know once you find out that you won't go 'hey, I bet we could use these people to make better soldiers.'\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander!\" said Jack exasperated. \"I don't know what you're talking about \xE2\x80\x93 obviously, since you refuse to tell me anything \xE2\x80\x93 but General Hammond told you every embarrassing story about me that he could remember. Do you really think that he's the type of man that would hurt innocent people just so we could get better soldiers?\" Xander looked surprised by this outburst but remained silent and wary. Frustrated, Jack went on, trying to get him to see that the government and the military were not always the evil people he took them for. \"I know there are people like that but we've been fighting those kinds of people who want to force me into retirement for years. And we don't let them win, no matter what. And on top of that, I wouldn't let Hammond do anything that would endanger you or whoever you're protecting because you're my son and that's my job as your dad!\" Xander didn't move or say anything, just stared with that same unreadable expression and Jack couldn't tell whether that was good or not. \"Look,\" he said self-consciously, \"all I need to tell him is how you managed to beat off eight NID. Beyond that . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"They wanted you to retire?\" asked Xander, finally speaking.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" said Jack. \"They forced Hammond out once and we had to blackmail them to get him reinstated. Thought they'd use you to get me out of the way this time. Might have worked, too.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh. Kind of anticlimactic,\" Xander relaxed back into the couch, and Jack heaved an internal sigh of relief. \"Okay,\" he looked directly at Jack who met his one-eyed stare evenly. \"I don't know how much you can avoid telling your CO. I'll leave that up to you, and so help you if you double cross me.\" He paused, dead serious, and waited for Jack's equally solemn, \"You have my word.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right,\" Xander began. \"So this is the part where I tell you that demons and vampires and all sorts of ugly evil things are real. And then you say 'no, that's crazy,' and want to have me locked up but can't figure out a way to do it since I'm over twenty-one and my psyche test is clean. Then I say 'yes, they are,' and you yell and scream, then I prove it, and you go into shock over the whole deal until finding refuge in 'okay, it's real' but not really believing it until you almost get eaten.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack though about it for a minute then voiced the only response he could come up with. \"What?\" Because Xander didn't just say what he thought he had, had he? Demons? Vampires? All sorts of ugly evil things?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack,\" Xander sat forward again with no grin or glint in his eye that suggested he might be joking. \"The world is far creepier than you ever thought possible. Every myth and urban legend you've ever heard is probably true including and especially the monsters part. They're real. Vampires, werewolves, things you've never even dreamed of that are looking for a nice human snack in the middle of the night when you're out walking your dog.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't have a dog,\" said Jack absently, still trying to absorb what Xander was trying to say.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine. Cat. Whatever,\" Xander brushed it aside. \"The point is, it's real and it's out there, and we're the front, middle, and last line of defense.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Demons? Vampires? All sorts of ugly evil things? Jack was still stuck on that part. \"So when you asked me if I believed in vampires \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I meant actual vampires,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh.\" Actual vampires. \"Okay.\" And demons. \"I can accept that.\" And all sorts of ugly evil things. Because, hey, went to other planets and fought aliens on a daily basis. Sure, no problem. \"Except for the fact that it's completely insane!\" Jack snapped out of his initial shock getting to his feet suddenly. Because, hey, fought aliens on a daily basis. He would have known about alien-like things on his own planet, he thought angrily. The SGC got wind of everything weird that went on, thank you very much.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The reason Dawn picked you up from the airport on Thanksgiving was because the rest of us were at a deserted YMCA stopping a ritual massacre,\" Xander went on as if he hadn't said anything. \"I got cut that cut on my arm and Willow got those scratches during the fight. You didn't see all the bruises down my side from getting thrown into a wall. And the fish in the soup didn't have eyes because we needed to use them for the potion that would disrupt the ritual.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Potion?\" Vampires, demons, ugly evil things, and now potions? It was just . . . \"Xander, are you even listening to yourself?\" he asked. He couldn't believe this, though he remembered the soup well enough. \"You're talking about fairy tale stuff!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, I'm talking about my life.\"</p>\n\
    <p>That simple statement brought Jack up short mid rant because Xander was not smiling. And instead of looking frustrated or bothered about not being believed, he just looked . . . like this was a normal reaction that would eventually pass. For some reason that just made Jack angry, like he was the one coming up with wild stories and talking out of his ass when it was the other way around. Because what did vampires or demons or whatever have to do with having eight NID agents in Xander's basement?</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm getting to that,\" said Xander, annoyance creeping into his voice, and Jack realized he had practically yelled the question.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Let me guess, they're vampires,\" Jack bit out caustically. Part of some delusion that because they were bad men they must be quote-unquote evil.</p>\n\
    <p>\"If they were vampires, they'd be dead, you wouldn't be here, and we wouldn't be having this conversation,\" Xander informed him evenly. \"The NID guys are here because of whatever you do, not me, so don't go blaming them on us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine,\" said Jack tersely. \"So explain it to me. What do 'vampires' have to do with the NID?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So, we've established that there are creatures of pure evil in the world \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you claim.\" Jack couldn't believe he was listening to this. Couldn't believe Xander, his calm, rational, sometimes funny son who worked at Home Depot was talking to him about vampires. The surrealism of this whole conversation was unreal.</p>\n\
    <p>\"\xE2\x80\x93 who like nothing better than to eat humans and end the world,\" Xander ignored Jack and his seething comment.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Still here, though aren't we.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander nodded reasonably. \"Because in opposition to the bad guys are the slayers.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Slayers?\" Jack asked at this new word. That hardly sounded reassuring to know there were a bunch of people called 'slayers' who went around 'slaying' monsters. \"That's where you come in? You're one of these 'slayers'?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander actually smiled at that, a hovering self-deprecating smile accompanied by a shake of the head. \"No,\" he said. \"Slayers are girls. Properly known as vampire slayers since they're what they kill the most of.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Teenage girls.\" Jack didn't like where this was leading.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Chosen by whatever chooses slayers,\" Xander nodded. \"Sometime during puberty.\" Puberty. Courtney's age. Memories of thirty girls crowded into the house over the summer. Self defense camp, he'd called it then. Before Jack could respond, Xander went on. \"When they're called, slayers get superhuman strength, speed, reflexes. Basically you put them in a normal fight and they'll win. Against vampires and demons, you even the playing field.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Teenage girls,\" Jack said again, this time for clarity. \"Superheroes against the monsters? You do know how ridiculous this sounds, right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack, would you just hear me out?\" Xander was now exasperated with him. \"I know you don't believe me right now, all right? I get that. But you wanted to know what the big secret was and I'm telling you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Secret?\" Jack asked incredulously. \"This is the secret? This is why you left in the middle of the night without a goodbye? Because of 'vampires'?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" Xander glared at him defiantly. \"You wanted the truth \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What truth?\" snapped Jack angrily, his words loud in his own ears. Of all the . . . He spun and loomed angrily over Xander who glowered up at him from his seat on the couch. \"You're talking about god damned vampires, for crying out loud! You still don't trust me enough to tell me what's really going on!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"The only reason I'm telling you is because I trust you, Jack!\" Xander stood now, too, forcing Jack to take a step back. His single brown eye practically burned in its socket.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You call this trust?!\" Jack yelled back. \"You tell me you have eight NID agents in your basement \xE2\x80\x93 who I have yet to see proof of \xE2\x80\x93 then start talking about vampires and little girls who kill them. This is not a game, Xander, and I don't know what you're playing at, but I want answers and I want them now! How the hell did you capture eight highly trained NID agents?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"They came, they tripped the wards, the got their asses knocked unconscious by three slayers and the rest of us. I hit mine over the head with an axe,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>His words froze Jack's next retort on his lips, a dozen emotions rushing through him. Anger, hurt, but most of all disappointment in Xander for thinking he would take this cooked up explanation as the truth. And trust? They didn't have that. They didn't have anything, he saw now. Just more lies on top of happy small talk about nothing. It was all a joke, just another laugh for the universe at his expense.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I want to see the NID agents,\" said Jack softly in his command voice, the one that even Daniel listened to on occasion. The one that went with the closed off, cold glare he was now giving his son like he was some young airman who didn't know who he was messing with.</p>\n\
    <p>But Xander glared back just as stubbornly, not giving an inch. \"No,\" he said. \"Not until you hear me out and see my proof.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Proof that vampires exist?\" asked Jack sarcastically, admiring Xander's tenacity if nothing else.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Proof that slayers exist,\" Xander corrected him. \"We don't keep vampires around,\" he added in a 'duh' tone.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Of course not.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You want proof or not?\" Xander ignored the sarcasm.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine,\" Jack sighed, his curiosity piqued in spite of himself. \"This I gotta see.\" How was Xander going to prove the existence of slayers, get one the girls to kill a hamburger?</p>\n\
    <p>Xander went to the door and called for Buffy who came in a moment later with a four-by-four piece of wood. She smiled cheerily at Jack who simply watched her suspiciously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I take it you've filled him in on the basics?\" Buffy asked Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Happy in denile-land,\" was his response. Buffy nodded, glancing back at Jack and assessing the false smile he sent her way.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Forgive me if I expected an actual explanation for everything,\" he said sickly sweet.</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy just handed him the beam and said, \"try to break it in half,\" at which Jack lifted his eyebrows. She had to be kidding. The beam was solid wood about four feet long and splintered at one end. Like someone had broken it. He ran his hands over the wood but neither felt nor saw any cracks along its length. He gave it an experimental twist with his hands but nothing gave. Hell, Teal'c would have a hard time putting a dent in it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Don't tell me. You're going to break it,\" he said, handing it back to her. Buffy was a small woman who couldn't have weighed more than a hundred twenty pounds, and he felt that was pushing it. She accepted the four-by- four confidently however, gripped it at either end \xE2\x80\x93 and snapped it in half with a simple jerk as if it were no more than a banana.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack blinked and accepted the two new pieces of wood that Buffy handed back to him. Okay, that was impressive, he conceded. Impressive and . . . wow. She had just broken practically a log in half with her bare hands. And okay, he didn't see the trick because it looked like there was no trick. And just how the hell had she done that?! He looked up at his son and Buffy who both were waiting for a reaction but Jack didn't know what to say. Or think for that matter. If this had happened in the briefing room, he probably would have believed it with only a minimum of bad jokes and reassurance from Frasier that she wasn't snaked. But Buffy wasn't snaked; neither Carter nor Teal'c had sensed anything. And Buffy had just broken a four-by-four in half with her bare hands. What the hell was he supposed to say to that? And where did a girl her size get that kind of strength from anyway?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Show off,\" he finally said, earning him a relieved grin from Xander and a wry, so-sue-me smile from Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep, three ring circus, that's me,\" she said. \"Except without the rings and hoops of fire though I can do those too. Jump through them, I mean. And, only one me instead of three . . . but you probably figured that one out.\" Jack looked up at her from the splintered wood and she abruptly stopped talking. Did they have lessons in how to confuse people with words? Granted, Jack didn't understand a lot of what Daniel or Carter spouted off, but he at least was comforted by the fact that somewhere someone did.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack, meet the Slayer,\" said Xander, and something in the way he said it put capital letters around the word.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Of vampires,\" Jack asked looking again from the split wood to the blonde and back. \"And demons and other ugly evil things?\" This was not happening, he told himself. He was not about to accept this. But damn it, he was, against his will like catching a cold he swore he was never going to get.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Whose slime never gets out of your clothes,\" Buffy added, which only made Jack think of the biohazard hampers in the locker room on base.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So those NID agents \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Never stood a chance,\" she finished.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And those wards you mentioned?\" he looked at Xander questioningly</p>\n\
    <p>\"Magical alarm system. Set off on the lawn.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Three really powerful girls and a magical alarm system. And vampires and stuff Jack really could have done with knowing less about. He should have been yelling again or something, anything but this sudden calm. Oh, hell. Hammond was never going to believe this. He could see his report now: Went to Cleveland to investigate botched kidnapping of son. Agents ambushed by barely legal residents. Agents beaten into submission by girls. Egos badly bruised.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you want to see them?\" asked Xander not needing to specify who. Still stunned, Jack followed him to the basement stairs, where Buffy left them for the kitchen and the smells of breakfast, and followed Xander down. It was a nice set up and obviously where the . . . slayers, he tried out the new word, stayed for their summer training. The tv had been moved in front of the back two rooms where sure enough four men in black gear sat on the floor before it, backs to the false wall. All four stood when they approached, one poked his head around a door and summoned the others from inside. And Jack saw that while there was nothing holding them back none of them moved any closer.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Harris,\" one of them said coolly, and Xander nodded to them. But all eyes were on Jack, the stranger, but none of them seemed to recognize him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How are you keeping them restrained?\" he asked lowly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Upstairs,\" was his son's short reply. He didn't want them to know. A good precaution given what he'd told Jack. The rogue NID cells were among those who wouldn't hesitate about experimenting on Buffy or any of the other slayers given half a chance. So he followed Xander back upstairs and back into the sitting room and listened as his son explained that by mixing a little bit of this and a little bit of that and saying a few words you could effectively make a one way force field to keep things from getting out while still being able to send things like food and remote controls in. It didn't sound like there was much to it. In fact, it sounded pretty damn useful. But he kept that comment to himself.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So that's it,\" said Xander when he finished. Once more he was leaning forward, elbows on knees with his hands loosely clasped between them. A thousand questions stuttered through Jack's mind but he didn't know where to start \xE2\x80\x93 didn't know if he wanted to know the answers, like how Xander had gotten involved and what exactly it was that he did now. But most of all what held him back was still a bad case of skepticism, because even though he'd seen it, he wasn't ready to just believe it yet. He smiled privately: this from a man that had a tv character based on him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is that a good smile or a bad smile\" Xander broke in on his thought, a little of the wary puppy creeping into his expression.</p>\n\
    <p>\"An I-don't-know-what-to-think smile,\" Jack replied. He held up a hand to stop whatever Xander was going to say. \"I think I need to talk to my team,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander let go his breath and nodded then got to his feet. Jack followed him out to the den where Teal'c was watching cartoons with Courtney right in front of the tv and Daniel and Carter were chatting with Dawn, though it looked like Daniel was doing most of the talking. Giles and Buffy had disappeared, presumably to the noisy and aromatic kitchen. It took a moment for them to register their presence in the room and Jack took the time to really look at the two girls lounging around like normal girls on vacation. He wondered if they were the other two slayers of the house, if they went out and fought vampires and knew how to kill them. If they could cast spells. And watching Courtney watch the animated adventures of pink and green sketches with a distracted expression as unchanging as Teal'c's, he wondered why her house had burned down.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dawn,\" Xander's voice disturbed the scene, pulling the teenager's attention from Daniel's story to him. \"Can you drive me to work?\" he asked, making Jack turn to him in surprise. He'd forgotten all about that. Dawn nodded and got to her feet, brushing past Jack as she and Xander left the room. \"I'll be home around five,\" said Xander in parting. SG-1 turned to Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We need to talk.\"</p>\n\
    <hr>\"So explain to me again that thing you were talking about,\" was the first thing Xander asked once he and Dawn were safely out the door. The chill wind felt good against Xander's face as they headed for the car.<p>\"What thing?\" Dawn frowned in thought.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The file thing you were spouting before I was awake when you woke me up.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, that,\" Dawn nodded now. She slid into the driver's seat while Xander went around to the other side of the car. He waited patiently while Dawn focused on the ignition, heat, and backing out of the driveway, but once they were on the street and moving forward she continued. \"Daniel Jackson and Sam Carter's files were in the NID computers too, along with another person called Teal'c. There weren't any photos but I remembered the names because they were in the same folder as Jack's file.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did you read them?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, not yet,\" Dawn replied. They turned onto the main road out of their sleepy neighborhood. \"Though I don't know how much it will tell us. Jack's was pretty vague. All this stuff about projects he's thwarted. If they played darts I bet his picture would be on the dart board.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander was comforted by that news that Jack was not a part of the lets- attack-on-Christmas party. \"Did they say what projects?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"They were only listed by designation. Stupid smart spies,\" she grumbled this last. Xander gave her a quick glance at her frustration, marveling at how she'd grown up following in both Giles's and Willow's footsteps. They're better footsteps, he amended.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How did telling him go?\" she asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"By the book,\" said Xander his mind jumping tracks from Dawn to Jack. As there were four stages of grief, there were four stages of learning about the dark and nasty underbelly of the world. Jack was still in stage three of conditional acceptance but not complete belief. \"He was a little calmer about Buffy than I thought he'd be, but he'll deal okay when it sinks in, I think.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What he'd say about the NID?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We didn't get that far. He wanted to tell the others first, so I figure we'll have a big happy talk tonight.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Should I get ice cream?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dawn, do the words 'strapped for cash' mean anything to you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You have a job,\" she retorted.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Which covers normal groceries for eight people and now eight honored guests,\" Xander shot back.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We're only feeding them pancakes.\"</p>\n\
    <p>He ignored her. \"Which leaves little things like water, electricity, heat, and all the extra stuff for Christmas including Courtney's new stuff and the emergency plane tickets \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay, okay, sheesh,\" Dawn interrupted Xander's long litany of just exactly where all the money went. \"We're not that bad off are we?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" Xander admitted. \"But unless Giles gets things straightened out soon in England it's gonna get pretty tight.\" Winning access to Council accounts was turning out to be a long, slow process that yielded money in fits and bursts. So far they'd only gotten the small potatoes, but come summer training they would need gigantic faire sized potatoes. \"It won't be so bad once everyone goes off in January,\" he added referring to the end of the four-month visit from Buffy, Willow, Kennedy, and, though he'd been in and out, Giles. They were needed in other parts of the world and at the Council meeting after Thanksgiving they'd each chosen a continent to start in.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander wasn't happy to see them go. It was like they were finally splitting apart after practically a lifetime together, and for him and Willow it was. Sure they'd have Christmas and other holidays, but Xander knew it wouldn't be the same. They'd have their stories of their own slayers and slayer schools while Xander had his with Dawn and Andrew and Vi and Diana. And then Dawn would leave next year and then the older slayers would go off and new ones would come guard the hellmouth until they destroyed this one too. Or it destroyed them. Slayers would die and be chosen and he would be there helping, training, guiding, and it would never end, this fight against all that tried to hurt humanity. Cheery thoughts. Barely twenty-three and Xander already felt like an old man.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what were you guys talking about in there?\" he asked to distract himself.</p>\n\
    <p>\"History stuff,\" Dawn answered. \"He asked about school and we started talking about college stuff. I told him I was interested in a good language program and he just started talking. He said I should look for places with good exchange programs too because living in another country is the best way to learn. So that means I should go visit Buffy a lot. And Willow and Faith and whoever gets China.\" Xander smiled at this obvious maneuvering, having no doubt that Dawn would travel widely over the next couple of years. \"Anyway,\" she went on, grinning too, \"then we started talking about places he's been. You know he was born in Egypt? He's an archeologist now and did the teaching thing before he went to work for the military. His specialty's Egypt, obviously, but I get the feeling that he's pretty up on every other ancient culture too, but that's just a hunch.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander was impressed that she had gotten that much information out of one relatively short conversation. \"Any other deep dark secrets come to light?\" he asked teasingly.</p>\n\
    <p>Dawn shrugged. \"He's cute.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, I so did not hear you just say that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What? He is. Even you should be able to see that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Please don't tell me you have a crush on him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Me? Come on, Xander. He may be cute but he's still old.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And since when has that stopped anyone in our house?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Dawn just gave him a withering look that Xander couldn't help but grin at. \"When did Angel, Spike, or Anya act their age?\" she asked back and Xander had to concede the point.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just as long as you remember that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So it's okay if I date immature vampires?\" Dawn asked slyly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No!\" Xander glared at her. It wasn't funny. No, not funny at all. \"Dawn . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm kidding,\" she said. \"Jeez, relax. Not dating here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Keep it that way.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm just saying . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know what you're 'just saying.' Dating evil, sex bad. Trust me. I'm never going to get involved with someone I can't have sex with.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dawn!\" He really didn't want to hear this. Dawn and . . . god, he couldn't even think the word in the same sentence.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, I'm eighteen,\" she retorted disdainfully. \"And you're one to talk, Mr. Sex-Olympics.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander let out a strangled noise. No, definitely not going to think about Dawn and . . . at all. Ever. And thank god for work, he thought desperately as Dawn finally turned into the strip mall where Home Depot sat in all its orange glory. He practically leapt from the car away from the conversation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Five o'clock?\" asked Dawn and Xander nodded, summoning a shaky smile for her. Dawn grinned toothily back.</p>\n\
    <hr>His team's reactions were about what Jack had expected. Carter began with an outright, \"Impossible!\" while Daniel looked pensive and confused still mulling it over. Teal'c frowned.<p>\"Sir,\" said Carter in her serious and reasonable tone of voice. \"That's simply not possible.\" And then she started off on something about synapses and energy that he didn't really follow but that sounded pretty impressive nonetheless. Daniel looked impressed and that was enough for him. Only . . .</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're forgetting about the magic part, Carter,\" he said. And why was he defending this totally insane idea? It wasn't like he completely believed it either. If not for Buffy's display of strength and the captured commandos, he would be dismissing it entirely.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We've certainly seen enough that we haven't been able to explain before either,\" said Daniel quietly. \"I'll have to research the myths. I'm not saying I'm convinced, but we should at least look into it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I am curious why we have never seen any indication of vampires before,\" said Teal'c. \"We receive information on any suspected Goa'uld activity. Would not mass murder of civilians be a similar warning sign?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know,\" said Jack scrubbing his face and running tired hands through his hair. \"All I know is that Xander's explanation for the NID was magic and slayers. And you didn't see Buffy break that four-by-four,\" he pointed to the two pieces which were still by the sitting room couch. The others followed his finger and stared at it for a second.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, let's accept for the moment that it's true,\" said Daniel, rising from his seat to pace. \"The existence of magic and strong . . . girls gave them warning and a chance to take out the NID. How did they get past the guns?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Disarmed them before they could use them,\" Buffy's voice from the door had every head spinning her way. \"Sorry to interrupt, but you guys want breakfast?\" Seeing their chance at answers, Jack nodded and they moved the party to the kitchen where Andrew was dancing around the stove. Bacon and pancakes were already done and now eggs were getting scrambled. Courtney was already there munching on toast while Giles sipped tea in the corner, eyeing them as they came in. But what Jack noticed was the new unpainted boards filling in a section of wall.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's where mine landed,\" said Courtney suddenly. She was watching Jack study the wall. \"Kicked him in the stomach.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You kicked a full grown man into a wall?\" repeated Carter incredulously. A brief glance at the others found them to be studying SG-1. Like Xander earlier, none of them were smiling. \"I'm sorry, that's just \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know it's quite incredible,\" interjected Giles. \"But I assure you it's quite true. The supernatural is real, however much you may want to deny it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Your specialty is folklore, isn't it Mr. Giles?\" asked Daniel, blinking owlishly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The occult and demonology actually,\" said Giles. \"Though folklore does play into that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Then you know that there are usually alternate explanations for most superstitions, many of which are due to coincidence and fear.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Great,\" said Buffy with a smile that definitely had teeth behind it. \"My life is an alternate explanation. Like gangs on PCP or boiler room explosions or earthquakes and sinkholes or gas leaks or laryngitis.\" At each word her voice rose and she stalked closer to Daniel with eyes so hard and cold that it was as if another person glared out at them. One who had seen much and lost much and was about to pounce on anyone who got in her way. Buffy radiated power, controlled but with a terrible promise. Giles made no move to stop her. \"I've heard them all. So don't you come in here to our house and our world and presume to tell me that I fight figments of my imagination.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel managed to keep his retreat to one step back. \"I'm sorry,\" he said quietly. \"I meant no disrespect.\" He flashed her his sweet-innocent- mistake eyes that had mollified many woman in his time and that once more seemed to do the trick. Buffy nodded once and grudgingly stepped back, crisis averted. But Jack's eyes followed her even as Giles smoothly stepped in and started talking about the origins of vampires and the world. He watched how Andrew carefully watched her, the release of tension from the young man's shoulders when he tentatively offered her some bacon and she accepted with a tired smile. She didn't appear to be paying attention to what was going on behind her, but when she rejoined the group she was standing between Teal'c and Courtney her own eyes sliding over him and Carter and Daniel until they met Jack's, hard and challenging. And in that stare, Jack saw a leader asking him silently if there was going to be a problem here. He said no, by nodding and looking away first. No problem here. Because he had also seen in those few seconds of understanding, that SG-1 would lose and lose hard.</p>\n\
    <p>The next few hours passed in bliss for Daniel and Carter who ended up in the dining room arguing with Giles about what was and wasn't possible. Jack and Teal'c had stayed with them for the first bit about basic supernatural stuff like how to kill vampires but once the other three got going on the laws governing magical use, Jack couldn't say yes faster when Andrew asked if anyone wanted to play Jedi Knights on his new X-Box. The others would give him the Reader's Digest version later anyway.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew,\" said Teal'c while the kid was setting up. \"Have you encountered many vampires?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Vampires?\" Andrew adopted what would have passed for a knowing look on anyone else but him. Casually he tossed them controllers. Jack's fell short. \"I've encountered many, my friend. Too many to count. I've braved the darkness and the creatures that lurk in the shadows and come out on top every time.\" He nodded gravely then hurried and sat down when the two men looked him over in disbelief. It wasn't just the faux tone of voice, but also the scrawny stature and complete air of incompetence the poor kid had. Andrew, Jack concluded, was one of the strangest people he'd met. And that was saying a lot.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Really?\" Jack finally said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Of course,\" Andrew tried again for the look of wisdom but then realized that it wasn't working. \"Mostly because I was with slayers who get in trouble if I get hurt. But I have killed vampires! Over ten!\" he said in a normal, if a little proud voice.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So they do exist,\" said Teal'c.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah. You wanna see my bite mark?\" He craned his head suddenly and pointed to a scar on his neck: two puncture holes linked by over and under arching lines. Just like someone had bitten him. Real. Evidence of vampires marked into Andrew's skin for life.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why are you not now a vampire?\" asked Teal'c while Jack was still absorbing this new revelation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Cause I didn't suck his blood,\" Andrew explained, his voice dropping so they had to lean in to hear his words. \"It's a very dark ancient blood ritual where the vampire offers his victim eternity, and as the last drops of his blood seep away from him, on the verge of death, his sire opens a vein and lets him drink. Then at sunset the following night, when light disappears from the world, the new vampire rises from his own grave, powerful and hungry.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Until he gets his ass staked by a slayer,\" Dawn's matter of fact voice made Andrew jump with a muffled 'eep' at which the girl rolled her eyes as she joined them on the couch. \"Whacha playing?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jedi Knights,\" said Andrew getting up and plugging in the fourth controller, which he then gave her.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you one of these slayers?\" Teal'c asked the question the Jack had been wondering all day.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Me, no,\" said Dawn. \"I'm just the tag-a-long little sister.\" Andrew snorted and she kicked him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So who's the third one here?\" asked Jack. \"Willow?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Kennedy,\" said Andrew, eyes glued to the screen as he picked his character. When he and Dawn started fighting over who got what, Jack realized that they weren't going to get anything more interesting out of the two, so he too threw himself into the game.</p>\n\
    <p>Around one, a very tousled Willow and Kennedy finally came downstairs in bathrobes and gave Jack and Teal's a surprised hello, before darting into the kitchen and back upstairs. Dawn yelled after them to be back down for dinner at six or starve, muttering something about nymphos under her breath afterwards that Jack really wished he hadn't heard. The afternoon passed.</p>\n\
    <p>The match broke up at quarter to five when Dawn had to leave to get Xander and Andrew needed to get dinner started. Teal'c and Jack followed still discussing tactics and levels and gave him a hand. By the time Xander and Dawn returned, bringing with them a carton of ice cream, Andrew had taken pancakes downstairs to the NID and ordered the three intellectuals to set the table. They looked a little confused at first but eventually managed just fine. By six, everything was ready and on the table, and by six ten, Willow and Kennedy showed up giggling like crazy. Jack tried not to think about it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So,\" said Buffy once the initial feeding frenzy had calmed down and conversation loomed on the horizon. \"What are you going to do about the guys in the basement?\" she asked. And Jack realized that business had finally begun.</p>\n\
    <hr>Xander looked up from his spaghetti to Jack with everyone else.<p>\"We can take them off your hands. No questions asked.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No investigation or anything?\" asked Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"As far as everyone else is concerned, we are the investigation. And we have enough pull that no one else will look into the matter,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What about the people who ordered it?\" asked Buffy. \"They're gonna want to know, right? And they'll have people go inside or whatever and ask them what happened?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack paused for a second before nodding. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"The NID were talking about is a rogue section. And we don't know where all their cells are.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sleeper cells?\" asked Xander, pulling the word out of the back of his head. Jack looked at him, surprised that he knew the term, but nodded.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Like that sleeper agent thing?\" asked Dawn. \"Don't know they're there until you pull the trigger?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Except in this case, the trigger is orders form the top,\" said Xander. \"Do you know who that is?\" The looks their four guests shot each other said that they did know but were reluctant to say. \"Jack, what will he do if he finds out about slayers?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"The rogue NID would be very interested,\" said Daniel quietly when Jack didn't answer right away. \"If they find out, they'll keep coming after you.\" He glanced at Courtney who stared at him wide-eyed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So there's no guarantee that they won't talk,\" said Buffy. And Xander knew what was coming next. So did Willow. He watched as his two best friends shared a long look that held a whole conversation and suddenly Xander was glad he had let Dawn talk him into ice cream. \"So when can you get them?\" asked Buffy quietly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're still going to let us take them?\" asked Jack. \"Despite the risk?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"There's not going to be any risk,\" Willow spoke up from her end of the table looking a little ashy to Xander. \"I'm gonna . . .\" she waved a hand vaguely.</p>\n\
    <p>But Jack seemed to get it. And he didn't look too happy about it either. Nor did any of his friends. \"You're talking about wiping their memories?!\" Daniel asked apalled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I see little other choice,\" Buffy snapped his attention from Willow to herself. \"It's either that or kill them, and we don't kill humans as a general rule.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And messing with their memories is excusable?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"If it means keeping teenagers out of NID labs, then yes.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel closed his mouth at that though his eyes were still not appeased. Xander could understand his protest, they all could having been there before, but at the same time, it was more important to keep their secret identities as secret as possible from the government.</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right,\" said Jack also coming to the same conclusion. \"We can have them out of here the day after tomorrow.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So are you going to reimburse us for groceries then?\" asked Andrew. \"Cause they kinda ate a lot.\"</p>\n\
    <p>And Xander, seeing his opportunity for more money piped in, \"And compensation for loss of sleep and hardship would be nice too.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And incentive to not go to the police or press,\" Dawn added. Sam cracked a smile at that but Jack didn't seem too amused. \"What?\" asked Dawn him. \"I've got college tuition to pay next year.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll ask the General about the groceries,\" said Jack. \"But I'm not making any promises.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So about this general guy,\" said Buffy and Xander could actually feel Jack and the others wince at her irreverent tone. \"He's not going to gives us any problems, right? Xander says you stood up for him and that he's an okay guy . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"General Hammond is a most honorable man,\" said Murray in that weird formal way of his. \"He will not betray your trust in him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" said Willow suddenly, a worried frown on her face that put Xander immediately on guard. \"Hey, hey,\" she said, this time staring but not staring at Murray, like she was trying to see the air around him. And when she blinked back from wherever, she looked a little confused and not the good kind of confused where it's something normal and . . . and now she was really staring at Murray. \"Are you human?\" she asked. \"Because you're sort of are but you're also sort of not and you're not connected and I think you're what's been itching me all day even though I wasn't really paying attention, but you're not are you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Murray sat as still as ever. And more importantly, at Willow's first question Jack, Sam, and Daniel had all suddenly sat up and stared at her, then each other in what were definitely not she's-crazy looks but shit- she's-onto-us looks. Jack wasn't even registering the babble that usually had him scratching his head. Figuratively speaking. But Willow was right. For a second, Xander felt like shouting, 'I knew it!' but he refrained and settled for an internal trumpet fanfare because Jack did not look happy. Daniel and Sam didn't look happy either but they were both looking at Jack whose unhappiness doubled theirs combined. And Murray simply raised an eyebrow as if to say, 'moi?'</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you an alien?!\" Andrew broke the tense silence first in an awed voice. \"Because that is so cool! Ooh, you're doing the Spock eyebrow thing!\" He lifted his hand in the Vulcan greeting. \"Live long and prosper.\"</p>\n\
    <p>No, Jack was not happy at all. \"He's not an alien,\" he told Andrew impatiently.</p>\n\
    <p>\"But he is,\" said Willow, certain now. \"He's not from Earth because he's not connected to her. Except for the little strands like a baby's but those don't really count since you're not a baby.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow, Murray is not an alien,\" Jack repeated. \"If he were, do you think the government would let him out of its sight?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's not an alien.\" But no one was buying it. If Willow said he wasn't from Earth, he wasn't from Earth. And the import of that statement just hit Xander all of a sudden. Not from Earth. From another planet. Xander had to go with Andrew on this one \xE2\x80\x93 that was so cool! In a really, really freaky kind of way.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So the deep space telemetry is really talking to little green men \xE2\x80\x93 or not green as the case is?\" he asked a little giddy himself at the idea as he glanced at Murray's decidedly not green palor.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, and you're like the cultural person, right?\" Dawn asked Daniel excitedly who looked decidedly uncomfortable at her sudden attention. \"That's why all the archeological stuff was there!\"</p>\n\
    <p>Sam's head immediately snapped to the teenager who realized her mistake as soon as the words slipped out of her mouth. \"What archeological stuff where?\" the major asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, nowhere?\" tried Dawn as the tension at the table skyrocketed. Everyone stopped eating looking from Sam to Dawn to Jack to Buffy, the four of whom had their own circle of wary glances going.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dawn,\" said Jack in a gentle yet dangerous tone of voice that Xander remembered from earlier. \"Where did you see that archeological information?\" he asked. Dawn stared at him mesmerized and a little scared, her confidence shaken by his sudden commanding intensity.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack!\" Buffy snapped before Dawn could answer. \"Where we got our information is irrelevant. As far as I'm concerned, Murray could be a cow and I wouldn't care as long as he kept his teeth off of humans. Stop threatening my sister!\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack swiveled his glare on Buffy who met it head on. \"This is classified information. If we have a breach in security, I consider that very relevant,\" he said. \"Now where did you get it?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Willow tentatively raised her hand and waved. \"Breach in security,\" she said. \"That's me. I don't think anyone else could have done it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You hacked the SGC computers?\" asked Sam, a note of disbelief in her voice.</p>\n\
    <p>Willow and Dawn exchanged a brief look that said 'guilty' to anyone with eyes. \"If that's what you call Area 52, then yeah,\" she said. \"But it totally wasn't the system's fault,\" she hurriedly added. \"You have really good security and we couldn't have done it without cheating. And the not keeping top secret stuff on internet linked computer was brilliant.\" She smiled. Jack rubbed his hands through his hair and Daniel looked like he wanted to grin.</p>\n\
    <p>Sam asked, \"Cheated?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Magic.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack looked up. \"You used magic to hack into the most secure computers in the country?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Second most, and yeah. The old fashioned way wasn't doing too good.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What second-most?\" Sam sounded slightly offended by Willow's correction.</p>\n\
    <p>The redhead ducked her head modestly. \"Ours are better. Because of the magic. Your code is pretty droolworthy though. You don't mind if I borrow some of it do you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I designed the system,\" said Sam. Willow immediately sat up, awe on every line of her face.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You did? That's like . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Carter, could you two drool over code later?\" Jack interrupted while Willow was still searching for words.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, sir.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you got into our computers,\" he continued, directing the question to Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You were a suspect for being behind the NID, so yeah. But we thought you did weapons stuff,\" she answered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why's that?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Cause all the stuff at that other place was weapons stuff.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Area 51,\" Xander clarified before Jack had an ulcer. Though he still looked like he was going to have one.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So intelligent life on other planets exists?\" asked Giles getting back to the basic revelation of the evening. Xander could tell he was rather surprised by the idea. And when Jack sighed and nodded, the cat already running circles around them, Giles's only comment was \"Dear lord.\" He took his glasses off to clean them. Xander watched the familiar ritual not sure whether he was surprised or not by the confirmation. He was leaning toward not. But then . . . he looked at Murray and a shiver ran up his spine.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is your real name Teal'c?\" asked Dawn then. \"With an apostrophe?\" At the sudden combined eyepower of the four she added, \"Not your computers, the NID's.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is there anyone you didn't hack?\" asked Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Chill out,\" Kennedy retorted, speaking for the first time. \"So your secret's out. Deal with it. I mean it not as if you don't know about our secret lives. Quid pro quo. Anyway, we have enough problems without aliens. Why do we care what you do in Area 51 or 2 or whatever you call it?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack was about to reply when Andrew interrupted. \"Can I have your autograph?\" he asked Murray.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew!\" at least three people exclaimed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What? You know you want one too,\" he replied. \"It will commemorate the day the saucers landed, the day when Murrays arrived where no Murray had gone before!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Murray's his name, dumbass,\" Kennedy told him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I think it's great too,\" said Willow cheerfully. \"How do you like Christmas so far?\" she asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I have lived on this planet for seven years,\" said Murray. \"And have had as many Christmases.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh,\" Willow deflated at this news, but then brightened again. \"But never Hanukah, right? Or solstice? Though both are past now, I guess, but we still have our decorations up and \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You've been here seven years?\" Xander interrupted. Seven years and no news flash?</p>\n\
    <p>\"It has been classified,\" said Murray or Teal'c.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Very classified,\" added Jack. All went silent at this reminder that knowledge was not always a good thing. In fact, if Xander remembered correctly, it was a prosecutable thing.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So now what?\" asked Xander. \"Now that we know stuff we shouldn't and you know stuff that you shouldn't.\" He met Jack's gaze across the table, his face inscrutable.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know,\" he finally said. \"I don't know.\"</p>\n\
    <hr>AN: Sorry about the cliffhanger last chapter. Sorry about the one here. I know this chapter's a little on the slow side, but it's only the day after Christmas . . ."

    <p>Chalk fiddled with the dials and frowned.</p>
    
    <p>"What's wrong, Chalk?" 
      </p>
    
    <p>"This one doesn't want 
      to come in. I keep getting snow!" Another tiny adjustment, and a picture 
      and sound appeared. "There it is!"
    
    </p>
    <hr width="50%">
    
    <p>
    
    
      "Bodie, you <i>can't</i> be serious."</p>
    
    <p>"Look, I checked it 
      over with the lads down in surveillance, and it's no make <i>they've</i> ever 
      seen, so I brought it down to this old mate of mine, right? And that's what 
      he said."</p>
    
    <p> "But, Bodie, the whole 
      thing's insane! You can't tell me you still believe in Father Christmas!"</p>
    
    <p>Bodie glared at him from 
      his position on the floor and brandished the (squished) shiny red-and-green 
      bug. "Well, what do you call <i>this</i>, then? Or the others?" Doyle 
      opened his mouth to answer, closed it again, huffed, shifted awkwardly from 
      one foot to the other, and searched for an explanation, which completely failed 
      to come to him. Bodie smirked triumphantly and resumed crawling about the floor, 
      examining the undersides of the furniture, in search of a device to match those 
      he'd destroyed in the other rooms.</p>
    
    <p>Doyle tried another tactic, 
      posing dramatically in the doorway in an effort to distract his partner. If 
      you couldn't beat them, try to get them to give up. Which, unfortunately, only 
      worked if they were looking at you. And while Doyle himself had a rather interesting 
      rear view, Bodie had his head under the bed, and couldn't see him at all. Doyle 
      gave up with a sigh.</p>
    
    <p>"Look, Bodie..." 
      Doyle moved out of the way as Bodie shifted to the dresser. "What's the 
      point? I mean, if it <i>is</i> really Father Christmas, what's it matter if 
      he sees you?"</p>
    
    <p>Bodie glared at him briefly, 
      and resumed his search. "All I know is, I'm not having some bloody great 
      elf watching everything I do! Christ, mate, isn't Cowley bad enough?"</p>
    
    <p>Doyle had to admit, he had 
      a point. Except... "If it is really Father Christmas, don't you think he'll 
      find some other place to spy on you? I mean, you can't..." Bodie shifted 
      to the wardrobe. "You can't just go around looking for bugs everywhere 
      you go!"</p>
    
    <p>"Yeah, well it'll be 
      enough for me if I just... ouch!... get them out of <i>here</i>! Nobody's bugging 
      me in my own flat!"</p>
    
    <p>"<i>Our</i> own flat, 
      you mean." </p>
    
    <p>"<i>Our</i> own flat. 
      Which is the whole point!"</p>
    
    <p>"Huh?" Somehow, 
      he'd missed something there.</p>
    
    <p>Bodie paused on his way 
      out of the wardrobe, and gave Doyle a deceptively sweet look. "There <i>are</i> 
      some things the old man doesn't need to know, aren't there?" The look turned 
      downright lecherous. "Besides, I'm planning to be naughty with you later. 
      Wouldn't want to muck up my chances of a pressie, now would I?"</p>
    
    <p>"Your chances of that, 
      mate, are long past. Let's start last Boxing Day, shall we?"</p>
    
    <p>Bodie grinned and headed 
      for the window, running his hands around the frame. "Was nice, wasn't it?" 
      He paused. "Hang about, if it was nice, it can't be naughty, can it? Sure 
      to be okay with him. <i>Still</i> don't like the nosy bugger looking in, though." 
      </p>
    
    <p>"Fair enough. You really 
      don't care for him, do you? When's the last time you got pressies from him, 
      then?" </p>
    
    <p>"Dunno. Haven't been 
      good in a very long time." He stopped, both hands on the top of the window 
      frame. "Got it!" Triumphantly, he brought down the last little brightly-coloured 
      device and threw it to the ground, moving closer to Doyle as he stepped on it. 
      "Still, must be doing something right. Got you, didn't I?"</p>

    Section 21: New Plan<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Aeryn woke up late two days later to a cold spot on the bed beside her. John hadn't gotten back last night. Aeryn sighed, not really bothered by his absence but missing him all the same. He and Sam had been closeted two tiers away trying to figure out a way to get the humans back to their reality. In other words, they had something to do while the rest of them recovered from the excitement of the past two weekens.</p>
    <p>Aeryn had spent a lot of the time on her own putting things back in order in the maintenance bay. With the quiet had come a time to think about everything and nothing. About being tired of getting captured by random people, about keeping her baby safe on Moya, about Chiana and John and D'argo and Rygel, how getting married would or wouldn't change things, and perhaps scariest, about becoming a mother.</p>
    <p>Growing up in the peacekeeper ranks left Aeryn with no idea about what to do with a child. On the other hand, she knew that her baby would be loved, not just by her, but by everyone on Moya. She had faith that together they would be fine.</p>
    <p>Chiana was especially excited about the baby. Whenever Aeryn visited her, she kept asking about how long pregnancy would be, and what it felt like. It overwhelmed Aeryn a little bit because it was too early to really know a lot of the answers. D'argo knew more about the whole process than she did.  He had suggested asking the humans, but Sam was busy with John, and Aeryn didn't feel comfortable talking to the men about pregnancy.</p>
    <p>Jack had helped her clean up the day before in the maintenance bay. They hadn't talked much, just worked in a companionable silence that was occasionally broken by questions about where things went or what they did. Aeryn found him easy to talk to, and in many ways like John, ever ready with a reference to something familiar from Earth.</p>
    <p>She hadn't seen much of the other two. Daniel had gone in search of people to question about anything and everything. Teal'c on the other hand had spent his time avoiding being alone with Norianti - a situation that seemed to amuse all of the humans and elicit sympathy from the crew. Aeryn sensed the tight control Teal'c held over himself that only relaxed when he was with his teammates. Now the old woman's constant advances bombarded him, and while he was handling them well, Norianti was a force that was fraying even his most stoic reserve. As a result, Teal'c had taken to visiting either Pilot and Moya, where she wouldn't bother him, or D'argo who had no qualms about getting rid of her one way or another.</p>
    <p>Now it was ship's morning on the third day after the attack and Aeryn had run out of immediate tasks to do. As of yesterday, the maintenance bay was in order. Other chores that helped Moya function were moot until the ship healed or returned to space. So with few options, Aeryn rose, dressed, and went in search of her missing mate.</p>
    <p>She found him where she had left him the night before, only this time he was sprawled on the floor amongst panels of paper, sound asleep. Nearby slept Sam next to the remains of last night's dinner, her head cushioned on her arms. Carefully picking her way through the mess, Aeryn couldn't help but smile at the peaceful tableau.</p>
    <p>"John," said Aeryn softly. Gently she shook his shoulder to wake him. "John."</p>
    <p>"Mmmrn," he groaned, turning away from her in an effort to pillow deeper into the floor. Only when his fogged brain realized it really wasn't worth the discomfort did he crack his eyelids open. "Morning?" he asked hesitantly.</p>
    <p>"Uh- huh," Aeryn nodded. "Come on," she squatted down to help him. "You need to sleep in a bed."</p>
    <p>"Wait, wait," he said as they got him to his feet. Letting go of Aeryn, John bent to look for something on one of the papers. The crashing and crinkling woke Sam with a start.</p>
    <p>"What time is it?" she asked, rubbing her eyes.</p>
    <p>"Morning watch," Aeryn answered. Sam groaned, then grimaced as she looked down at the clothes she had slept in.</p>
    <p>"Morning?" she asked again just to be sure. Aeryn smiled at her and nodded.</p>
    <p>"Hah! Found it!" John cried behind her. He clutched at one of a million pieces of paper scattered about the room. Aeryn turned to him for an explanation. "We think we can get them back to their reality."</p>
    <p>"Really?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah. I think," John frowned at the paper. "It's pretty simple actually within the framework of our combined wormhole theory - "</p>
    <p>"John," she interrupted before he could get lost in his thoughts again. "Breakfast first."</p>
    <p>John looked up and nodded. "Yeah. And maybe a nap."</p>
    <p>"I've got to report to the Colonel and get cleaned up," said Sam.</p>
    <p>"You look like you could use some sleep too," said John.</p>
    <p>Sam offered them a half smile as they parted company at the door. "Then I'm sure the Colonel will order me to bed too."</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"So let me see if I've got this straight," Daniel said, his brow creasing in concentration. "We're going to activate the stargate to get back into the wormhole system that you think connects all realities." Sam nodded. "We'll hold hands so that John can guide us through and essentially match us to the stargate system in our reality. And we'll come out where?"</p>
    <p>"Any planet in our reality will suffice," Sam explained. "I'll be able to determine if we're in our reality or one that is really close. But we think that since we came through from a stargate in our reality to this one, we'll go back to our reality."</p>
    <p>"How's that? Or do I not want to know?"</p>
    <p>"Given the differences in how wormholes function out here, we think that the stargates keep realities separate. Somewhere along the path to P5X-979 there was a breach into this reality. John should be able to find that breach and return us through it into our wormhole system."</p>
    <p>"Ah, of course," said Jack blithely.</p>
    <p>"So how does John get back?" asked Aeryn, ignoring the Colonel.</p>
    <p>"They call that planet they were trying to get to before and I go back through the breach to here," said John. It wasn't the greatest plan, he knew, but theoretically it should work.</p>
    <p>"I don't like this plan," said D'argo.</p>
    <p>"Neither do I," Aeryn seconded. "I'm going with you."</p>
    <p>"No, you're not," John immediately shot back. "It's too risky."</p>
    <p>"Which is exactly why you shouldn't go alone."</p>
    <p>"What about the baby?" He didn't want to contemplate the million things that could go wrong.</p>
    <p>"What about the baby? I want my child to have a father."</p>
    <p>"Aeryn, John's right. You can't risk your child."</p>
    <p>"But - "</p>
    <p>"I'll go with him."</p>
    <p>"D'argo, I don't need to cart an extra person around!"</p>
    <p>"After your last disaster, I'm not letting you go alone!"</p>
    <p>"Hey!" Jack tried to interrupt the growing argument, but the three tallest members of Moya's crew ignored him.</p>
    <p>"Going through the wormhole is bad enough -"</p>
    <p>"And you could be in hostile territory when you come out!"</p>
    <p>"Hey! Shut up!" shouted Jack at the top of his lungs. Immediately all eyes were upon him. "Can't you people make a decision without arguing?" The human commander looked back and forth between them in disbelief.</p>
    <p>"Isn't D'argo supposed to be the captain?" asked Daniel.</p>
    <p>"For decisions pertaining to Moya and our movements as a crew. Which this is not," said John.</p>
    <p>"I beg to differ John. I am not losing you!" snapped Aeryn, her eyes flashing angrily.</p>
    <p>"And I'm not losing you!"</p>
    <p>"Hey! Hey!" Jack shouted again. More hostile glares shot his way. "Aeryn and D'argo, you stay here. John will take us through and come back. He knows what he's doing. He'll be fine."</p>
    <p>"Knows what he's doing?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, no. I'm still going with him."</p>
    <p>Jack gave up as the argument once again picked up around them. His fellow teammates gave him sympathetic smiles for his vain attempts at getting things into motion. Norianti and Stark left soon after. Apparently, this wasn't going to end anytime soon. Rygel joined the four of them at one end of the table. "No you understand how I feel," he said. "No one ever listens to me either."</p>

  content: "<p>Bridges 10: Ten Years Taken Off of Life</p>\n\
    <p>AN: Two things. First, I'm sorry taking so long with this part. I had little writer's impediment (of execution and not ideas) that had me rewriting most of this a dozen times. On top of that, it's that time of the quarter again when homework abounds and everything is due. On the bright side I have through chapter 16 outlined on 'paper' finally.</p>\n\
    <p>Secondly, I've gotten a few notes about consistency of details such as Jack's estimations of how much Buffy weighs (Ch 2 and 9) and Courtney's age (Ch 7 and 9) and Xander's initial response to Jack being in the military (he says army in Ch 2). I just wanted to explain that because the story is being told from two points of view that often theses little things are deliberate since this is what Xander and Jack's reactions are. Unless it has been explicitly told to either of them, they don't know and are free to make assumptions and estimations as they see fit, and they're not always going to remember the exact numbers they came up with the last time they did so a week or months earlier. That said, sometimes they are screwups on my part because this is a really long story and it's difficult to keep track of everything.</p>\n\
    <p>Last: Thanks go to my new beta reader Finn for finding and fixing all those nasty typos and stuff. Cheers!</p>\n\
    <hr>Ten Years Taken Off of Life<hr>A brisk breeze greeted Xander when he stepped outside onto the back porch, escaping the after-dinner cleanup in the kitchen. Jack stood on the steps in borrowed shoes, having slipped away as soon as he could. He was looking up at the stars, muted by the neighborhood lights, and a waxing moon when Xander joined him, the older man barely acknowledging his presence with a slight flicker of his eyes.<p>Xander didn't know what to say so he said nothing and simply looked over the back yard that seemed to glow from the reflected light on the snow. It was his first winter in Cleveland and Xander had already had enough snow to last him a lifetime. The delight of those first flakes had quickly given way to weary annoyance as more just fell from the sky. Though making snow angels had been fun back in November. Dawn, Vi, and Diana had gone all out with a snow vampire too and then practiced demolishing it.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack hadn't moved from stargazing when Xander snuck a look at him. Following his eyes to the constellations, he wondered what the older man saw when he looked up there. Teal'c's planet? Were there other aliens that had made contact with Earth? Were they a threat, he couldn't help but wonder given that it was a top military secret. Xander had never given much thought to it. E.T. was about as far as he had gotten in thinking about life from other planets. Though there had been that Queller demon the year of Glory. Probably all sorts of things living on the moon. Did that mean then, that aliens were really demons? Murray or Teal'c, or whatever his name was, was certainly human enough looking. His beanie probably hid an ingrown horn or something.</p>\n\
    <p>He wanted to ask about a million things, but Jack didn't look like he was up for questions he probably couldn't answer anyway. It was as if he had completely forgotten Xander was there even though he had been standing there for at least a minute in the freezing cold that didn't seem to be bothering Jack. They were back to the not talking awkwardness of those first meetings last summer. Not that they had really pushed the big things before, or at all, but now that they had both fessed up to being Batman, it was as if Jack didn't even know where to start, and neither did Xander for that matter. Here they were, standing on a dark winter's night, supposing to be friends. \"So aliens,\" Xander said breaking the stillness. He still wasn't sure how he felt about that, somewhere up there on the cool but weirded out scale.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep,\" said Jack without moving, his eyes remaining on the stars.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander decided to take the verbal response as a good sign. \"How'd that happen?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack sighed and finally looked away from the sky at him. \"It's classified,\" he said softly, his words underscored by regret both in his voice and eyes and how they quickly darted away.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I guess I'm gonna get that a lot, aren't I?\" said Xander just as softly, also looking away over the yard. Jack didn't answer. \"So much for sharing.\" So much for getting past the gaping plot holes in their lives.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" Jack sounded tired. \"You already know too much.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know anything,\" Xander countered. \"I only know you have an alien in a mountain in Colorado. Except here, now because some guys want you to retire or something.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's a power play and definitely more than you should know,\" said Jack with annoyance. \"I don't know what Willow did with the computer stuff or the . . . the . . . thing she did with Teal'c, but whatever it was I wish she hadn't. I don't know how I'm going to explain this to the General,\" he sighed again, running a hand through his hair. \"The computer breach alone is going to send him through the roof.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow's not in any trouble, is she?\" Xander asked apprehensively. Jack gave him a what-do-you-think look that obviously said 'yes' in big bold letters. \"It was completely justified, you know,\" he replied, immediately defending his friend.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know. If I was in your place I'd have ordered the same thing,\" Jack nodded, then asked after a pause, \"The magic stuff's real, isn't it? Not some sort of technology? Even seeing the thing in the basement . . .\" he trailed off, but Xander understood. There was nothing like watching someone do their mojo to make you a believer.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, it's real.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is she really going to erase their memories?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"She's done it before,\" Xander replied.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Could you do it?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Me? No,\" said Xander, his thoughts flickering back to both times Tara had broken up with Willow because of memory magic. He remembered Anya wondering later if this would have fallen in her jurisdiction had she still been a 'justice' demon. \"I don't hone my inner warlock.\" Off Jack's questioning look he added, \"Even with a spell to follow it takes skill and power to do something drastic like that. I can only do the little stuff any idiot who can read can do.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack smiled a little at that but it didn't reach his eyes. Instead he regarded Xander as if he were searching for something but couldn't find it, and it was beginning to make him uncomfortable. \"What?\" Xander finally asked, hoping against hope that he didn't have alfredo sauce anywhere embarrassing.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing,\" said Jack glancing away, the awkwardness like a shroud between them. But there was definitely a something there.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" Xander repeated as his curiosity won out over caution.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's nothing. Really,\" said Jack looking up and away again, crossing then uncrossing his arms and jamming his hands in his pockets. \"I was just thinking about . . . about how much I don't know about you at all.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, well same here,\" Xander agreed. A lifetime's worth of stuff he thought, even as the word 'classified' echoed in his mind. \"But I guess you won't tell me much about what you do.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"There's all this paperwork and a pesky court martial if you spill the beans,\" Jack said regretfully, and Xander knew he was too good of an officer to do that. \"So vampires,\" Jack echoed his earlier comment about aliens. \"Andrew showed us his bite mark.\" Xander smiled at that. \"How did you find out about them?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I met Buffy,\" said Xander pretty much summing up the day everything changed with a slightly nostalgic smile. \"Tenth grade. I overheard her and Giles talking about them in the library first day of school, then Buffy saved Willow from a vamp a few days later and, voila, the beginning of a beautiful friendship full of untold danger with a dash of terror thrown in for kicks.\" The rest was history, Xander added to himself even as Jack regarded him with a carefully neutral expression. High school felt so long ago now, like a dream that bordered on a nightmare but one you still recognized as just a dream that you could wake yourself up from if it got too bad.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How much danger?\" Jack asked.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked at him for a moment wondering how much to tell him. He'd never told his own parents, his mom and the man he'd thought was his father, never told them anything. Even at his wedding all of Anya's friends had been introduced as circus people still in costume. Tony had been too drunk to notice.</p>\n\
    <p>But Jack wasn't Tony. Jack had noticed and he had worried and he hadn't been put off by excuses. His words from a week ago \xE2\x80\x93 'you are my business' \xE2\x80\x93 suddenly came back to him, and Xander decided that he wanted this to work. He wanted what Buffy had found with her mom and not what Willow held onto with her own parents from afar.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's dangerous. We fight against creatures that go out every night to find someone to eat. People die,\" he said. \"Do you remember about Jesse?\" he paused, continuing when Jack nodded at the familiar name. \"He was the first vampire I staked.\" Jack started at this but Xander went on. \"Me, Giles, Willow, we've all lost a girlfriend along the way, in Buffy's case two boyfriends. Two years ago I lost my eye.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"A fight?\"</p>\n\
    <p>He nodded abruptly. \"I got in the way of a really powerful guy who was more interested in playing. Thought it'd be funny,\" he added with a bitter twist to his lips. The memory of how it felt, the sickening squish of his left eye into his head still gave him nightmares, and even now made him shudder.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry,\" said Jack but Xander carefully shrugged it away. It wasn't going to bring his eye back, or Anya or any of the other slayers or Tara or Jenny or kids he'd grown up with or . . . he stopped because he could think of too many more people that were dead or forever hurt by the supernatural. \"I guess . . .\" said Jack, \"at this point it's pointless to ask you to stop.\" He crossed his arms across his chest again as if he were trying to distance himself from the Xander's life.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Pretty much,\" Xander agreed though he appreciated him saying it. But there was too much work to be done, too many reasons to stay. The fight had become so much of his life that he didn't think he would ever be able to just walk away.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why do you train them?\" asked Jack suddenly. \"The girls. If it's so dangerous they shouldn't be anywhere near this.\"</p>\n\
    <p>'Them' being the slayers, Xander couldn't fault him for demanding an answer, but at the same time there was no choice in the matter. \"That's what Courtney's parents said,\" he said quietly. \"They wouldn't let Courtney come to training last summer. Didn't take us seriously. If they had, maybe they'd be alive now.\" He returned Jack's heavy gaze with one of his own. \"It's not fair and it's not easy but slayers just can't ignore the Slayer inside. It gets them killed.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack sighed and ran his hand over his face as he absorbed this, clearly not happy with the situation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" the back door banged open and Andrew leaned around it while keeping his feet safely inside. \"Buffy wants you. Courtney's aunt and uncle are here,\" he said before quickly closing the door on the cold.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I gotta go,\" Xander turned back to Jack who simply nodded without looking at him. After a tense moment when neither one of them said anything, Xander left him on the porch and went inside. When he glanced out the window as he kicked off his shoes, Jack was again staring at the stars.</p>\n\
    <hr>Jack's eyes flittered from Orion to Cassiopeia seeing planets filled with trees and people he didn't understand, and he felt suddenly that he was on another such planet now as anger gave way to helplessness. It reminded him of the children on that one world upon whom the fate of their people rested to the point where they hadn't a chance to just be kids. Here it felt worse: the slayers were losing their innocence to violence. They were essentially soldiers born to fight a never-ending war. And despite what Xander had told him about Courtney, Jack almost had a mind to go up to Giles or Buffy and demand that they just stop training them and let professionals take care of the vampires.<p>And Xander . . . tenth grade, Jack thought. He'd been what? Fifteen? Sixteen years-old? Christ. It made him wonder again if this was all real because sixteen was just way too young to be killing what was left of your best friend. It was a wonder Xander was as normal as he was. Hell, he was still a kid to Jack, younger than most of the recruits they saw at the SGC. But at the same time so much older.</p>\n\
    <p>There had to be another way. This just couldn't be the only way to hold off all the . . . ugly evil things. Maybe he could talk to Davis about it since this would fall into the category of national security. At least he hoped so. If the government didn't know and hadn't done anything about it at this point, convincing the people who mattered might be a little difficult but if he could get Xander's help with the briefing, or even Buffy's, he was sure they could at least get people thinking about it. And put a bullseye on the girls . . . so maybe not Buffy's help. If they spun it right though, the Pentagon would never have to know about the girls or Xander or anybody, just the monsters.</p>\n\
    <p>With a parting look at the stars, Jack went back into the house quickly passing through the now clean kitchen and the dining room into the den. On the floor in front of the tv, Teal'c and Andrew were playing Jedi Knights while Daniel, Carter, and Dawn chatted on the couch. Or rather on closer inspection, Daniel and Carter were discussing mythology that could be reinterpreted while Dawn read a book and cast glances at the foyer.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Jack,\" Daniel greeted him looking up from the conversation when he walked in. His eyebrows lifted slightly in a small frown as if to ask Jack if he was all right. Nodding in response to both the greeting and the question, Jack glanced once more over the sparely populated room.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Where is everyone?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, Giles, Buffy, and Courtney are with her relatives in the front room,\" Carter supplied. \"Don't know where Willow and Kennedy are.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"On patrol,\" Dawn spoke up.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Patrol?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"In the city,\" she said. \"I think tonight's the west side. Today's Sunday, right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So they're out looking for . . . \" Daniel didn't know quite how to finish but Dawn understood anyway.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The usual fledges and signs of impending doom. Not much happens around Christmas though.\" She cast another look at the foyer before shrugging. \"They'll probably make a date out of it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack stared at her and wondered if she even heard what she was saying. What Xander had just told him was a very dangerous life where people died Dawn was shrugging off as nothing to worry about. \"When are they checking in?\" he asked perhaps a little more harshly than he intended.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You mean call?\" asked Dawn. \"They'll only do that if they need help. Otherwise they'll be back by morning at the latest.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Morning was an awful long time for them to be out there on their own, especially in a city at night where other dangers lurked besides the ones they were looking for. They could be mugged or trapped in a bad neighborhood or lost, and Dawn wasn't even sure where they were? To Jack's military mind, that was too many risks to take without enough back up.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What do you mean by 'signs of impending doom?'\" asked Daniel, getting back to her earlier comment.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Weird stuff that doesn't fall into the normal category of weird,\" Dawn frowned, having trouble defining it herself. \"Like, really strong demons \xE2\x80\x93 or talkative, threatening ones. Or missing artifacts from graves. Stuff like that . . .\" she shrugged. \"It's the kind of stuff that when you see it, you know it's gonna be bad, I guess. Though sometimes we miss it till it's almost too late.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Her last comment didn't sound very reassuring and neither was the thoughtful look on her face that was obviously thinking of specific examples. \"What sort of impending doom are we talking about here?\" asked Jack sharply.</p>\n\
    <p>Dawn glanced at Andrew on the floor who snuck a look over his shoulder full of apprehension and a hundred meanings. \"Massacres,\" said Dawn carefully. \"Rituals for any number of things. Sometimes the end of the world.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"End of the world?\" Jack asked in chorus with Daniel and Carter. Even Teal'c paused in his game with Andrew and looked up at this news.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It hasn't really happened in while,\" Dawn rushed on to reassure them, but Jack if anything felt even less reassured. \"There's only been, like, one major try here, everything else's been local scale stuff.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're saying there have been attempts to end the world?\" asked Daniel who was the first to recover. \"What are we talking about here? A magical destruction of Earth's existence or some apocalyptic scenario of wide spread natural destruction? There are many myths that \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hell on Earth,\" Dawn interrupted, her bluntness prompting him and everyone to silence. \"Mostly they just want that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack's mind flashed to Netu, the Goa'uld hell world that had been beyond anything he had ever imagined that Hell could be. If Dawn's definition was anything like what they'd been through . . . but it couldn't be, right? But if it was . . . Jack's outrage only increased at what these kids were dealing with. Damnit, they knew. SG-1 had been there, done that and bought out the save-the-world t-shirts. It was difficult enough when you had years of training to fall back on. \"And Willow and Kennedy are out there on their own?\" he asked. Looking for things that wanted Hell?</p>\n\
    <p>\"They're not going to die from walking in the street,\" said Dawn as if it were obvious but nonetheless on the defensive. \"You should pity who they meet.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Besides nothing smart is stupid enough to attack them if Willow's there,\" added Andrew in that brand of logic that was prevalent around this house which Jack for the life of him couldn't follow. He took a small measure of relief from the fact that both Carter and Daniel looked at each other in mild confusion before turning to the young man and asking,</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why would they be afraid of Willow?\" asked Daniel. It was a very good question, and one that Jack wanted an answer to as well. Andrew blushed under the sudden scrutiny, shifting uncomfortably from side to side as everyone stared at him for the split second before Dawn drew SG-1's attention back to her.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow's a witch,\" she said which was no answer at all since Jack and his teammates had already surmised as much from dinner. And from what Xander had said, she had enough skill and power to do more than low level spells, whatever that meant exactly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just how powerful is she?\" asked Jack suspiciously. Because if even the bad guys were afraid of her \xE2\x80\x93 and from Dawn's uncomfortable glance away, that was more telling than anything she could have said. Willow added up to more than just average. Andrew was suddenly very absorbed in his video game, doing moves even though Teal'c was no longer actively playing. \"Dawn?\" Jack turned back to the young woman on the couch.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" she said defensively. \"She's good, big deal.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack didn't answer. Big deal, indeed. It didn't really change anything except for the fact that Willow's power was considered something not to be discussed, but maybe they were simply wary of talking to virtual strangers about it, especially with the problems they had with the military in general. Don't let the enemy know just how powerful your weapons really are. Carter and Daniel for once taking their cue from him didn't press the matter, instead simply exchanging looks with Jack, Teal'c, and each other. At every turn, things were more than they seemed, convincing Jack further that these kids needed help. And that matter of national security? Hell on Earth definitely qualified.</p>\n\
    <p>Sudden shouting from the direction of the foyer broke off any further thought of how exactly Jack was going to get them help. \"You expect . . . believe . . . crap?!\" an unfamiliar man yelled, his words obscured by the doors and distance. Every head in the den snapped up but the reply was too soft to hear. Then, \"No!! We . . . Courtney away . . . lunatics . . . police . . . near my niece again!!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"They . . . dead . . . didn't listen . . .!!\" he heard Buffy shout back this time. \". . . want that?!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Stay away . . .!!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey!!\" That was Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Stop it!! Stop it!! Stop it!! Stop it!!\" Courtney's high voice broke over the argument ringing clearly through the house. \"They're dead!\" she screamed, her voice breaking at the sudden abuse. \"Vampires . . . right in front of me! They . . . screaming and they died! They died!!\" Then the sound of a door crashing open and running feet and the front door slamming open and closed. Dawn jumped up and ran after her while Jack and the rest of them got up, bewildered and wondering if they should follow or not. Andrew was the first to move, going to the window and pulling the curtain back just enough to see out into the front yard. Jack and his teammates soon joined him. In the background they could hear the murmuring voices of those in the sitting room.</p>\n\
    <p>Outside under the dull illumination of a street light, Courtney had run to one of the three trees in the front yard and started hitting it, knocking snow from the branches above. Dawn stood several feet behind her, not trying to stop her but waiting until she had tired herself out and collapsed to the ground. Then Dawn was there, cautiously at first then suddenly pulling the younger girl into a close hug as her anguished sobs echoed softly through the night.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, god,\" Daniel whispered as they pulled away from the window, the haunted look in his eye no doubt remembering the loss of his own parents as a child.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I thought . . .\" Carter never finished her sentence but from the stunned look on her face she felt as Jack did \xE2\x80\x93 that his stomach had just clenched into a knot. What had been haltingly accepted till now, even with the disturbing facts he'd since learned, was now devastatingly summed up in one little girl crying in the snow.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We've got to help them,\" Jack murmured. \"This isn't right.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What are you suggesting, O'Neill?\" asked Teal'c. \"At the moment we are unequipped to deal with the vampires and other demons.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm not saying right this instant,\" said Jack. \"When we get back to base we make a few phone calls, see if we can get some ball rolling so these kids don't have to deal with all this . . . crap.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're gonna tell?!\" Andrew's sudden entrance into the conversation reigned Jack's thoughts in, reminding him of Xander's demand that he not tell anyone beyond his team and Hammond. \"You can't do that!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew, we're not going to tell anyone about the slayers,\" Jack turned to him impatiently. \"That's the whole point: to keep them out of this. Her parents are dead because she got dragged into all this vampire stuff!\" He didn't know who he was angrier at right now, the vampires, Xander and Giles and Buffy for dragging Courtney into their world, or Andrew for not seeing that it had to stop.</p>\n\
    <p>\"But . . . but . . . that's impossible!\" Andrew protested. \"That's like asking Superman to stay in the phonebooth or Aragorn to stop being noble and kingly or \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That is not the same,\" Teal'c interrupted before anyone else came out of his mouth.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did you not see Spiderman?\" Andrew shouted, his voice squeaking slightly even as his eyes took on a slightly impatient manic glint that was perhaps the most surprising thing off all about the young man's outburst, aside from the fact that he was standing up to them at all. \"Courtney was Chosen,\" said Andrew, the capitals practically audible. \"It's destiny!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Destiny?!\" Jack shouted back. \"Getting her life destroyed was destiny?!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew,\" Daniel interjected in his reasonable voice that had calmed many an excited native. \"Don't you think destiny is exaggerating things a little? What about free will?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Gotcha, the thought flickered through Jack's mind as Andrew floundered for words, his face melting through an array of frustration. \"There's free will . . . but there's also destiny . . . like an umbrella . . . destiny, I mean. Only instead of keeping the rain out it just wants you to stay dry underneath. It doesn't care what you do under there as long as you stay dry . . . dry is free will . . . You can't escape,\" he said. \"'With great power comes great responsibility.'\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you're saying that because they can fight, they should?\" said Daniel looking over the tops of his glasses. He glanced quickly at Jack, and then said, \"Is that right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, you don't understand!\" Andrew said in a more normal voice though he was clearly still frustrated with them. Daniel's soothing tone had worked its magic and had even made Jack's own temper simmer down. \"It's not about the fighting, it's about the power!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Power?\" asked Jack, unsure what he meant.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You know, power. Everyone has it, but slayers more,\" said Andrew, again trying to explain but not having the words. \"She could kill a regular person if she wanted, or by accident. She could join the Dark Side of the Force just 'cause. If she hides she'll be found. She's always going to be involved because she is power. Destiny. The rest is keeping dry.\" He huffed. \"It makes more sense when Buffy explains it,\" he half whined.</p>\n\
    <p>But Jack thought he sort of understood where they were coming from, Spiderman not withstanding. Kids with superpowers were like kids with guns and Jack knew only too well what innocent tragedies came from that combination. If Xander and Giles and everyone else here didn't find them, train them, and give them an acceptable target then the death toll might be just that much higher. In their war, these were the soldiers they needed and they weren't going to turn them away. But it still didn't make it right, and given Andrew's resistance, of all people, he knew they would have their work cut out for them convincing the others.</p>\n\
    <p>He let out an explosive sigh, barely listening as Daniel continued arguing with Andrew. Here he'd come to Cleveland, fearing the worst from having inadvertently dragged Xander into his world, when in fact it was he who had been irrecoverably drawn into Xander's.</p>\n\
    <hr>\"I hate parents!\" Buffy groaned as she flopped back on the shoddy sitting room couch. Xander merely rolled his head to look at her from where he sat already splayed out. The relatives had just left, and it was only nine- thirty. It felt like half the night had already passed away.<p>\"Aunt and uncle,\" he corrected her, but Buffy only muttered a half hearted \"Guardians, whatever\" in response, which made Xander grin. Poor Buffy had no patience for normal people. He pitied the families she would have to talk to in Europe \xE2\x80\x93 in a foreign language. Thankfully they'd done a lot of the initial legwork last year so it wouldn't be quite the same disaster, but there were still all those newbies out there that had been called since then and all the ones to come. Xander was just glad he got to stay in America.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, at least they finally listened,\" said Giles from where he sat a little straighter in the armchair. \"That's something. I suspect they'll be all right in the end.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I hope so for Courtney's sake,\" said Xander though he agreed with the assessment. Kim and Paul Laysan had reacted by the book and had only lashed out in fear and denial. However, they loved their niece enough to take Courtney's blowup to heart. This family would make it. Others hadn't; some probably shouldn't have been told. A couple of the slayers had told him they had ended up denying it again to their parents who couldn't cope. Getting them back for the summer was going to be a challenge that Xander was not looking forward to.</p>\n\
    <p>As for the Laysans, Giles as the resident 'parent' was going to meet with them tomorrow, somewhere more neutral to talk about the details. Courtney would probably stay in Cleveland until all the legalities and school stuff were taken care of so they could maximize her training time. The real work wouldn't begin until the summer of course, but she needed more than just instinct for the interim.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander sighed. He hated this part of the watcher gig, dealing with the support systems and families that were changed forever. Sure the system was better now for the slayers but it was still pretty high up on the sucking scale.</p>\n\
    <p>Thinking of families and the Laysans in particular made Xander think of his previous revelation of the day. All things considered, Jack had taken it fairly well, but that was where Xander's experience with parents ran out. His own he had avoided as much as possible after eighth grade, like squeaky boards when you were trying to sneak in after curfew. Not that they had really cared enough to give him a curfew. Had Jack been his dad growing up, he was sure there would have been not only a curfew but an angry and worried-out-of-his-mind parent waiting up for him. Xander could handle Jack mad now only because of nerves steeled from years of standing up to Buffy and Giles, but his high school self would have stood no chance.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey Buffy,\" he said, again rolling his head to look at her. \"How did your mom take finding out, after you came back, I mean?\" he added referring to the summer Buffy had run away to LA.</p>\n\
    <p>She thought for a moment before answering. \"Things were different,\" she said slowly. \"At first I think we were both just getting used to each other again. She didn't push too much but she did ask what was going on.\" Buffy smiled faintly, \"A couple times she stayed up late and made cookies that were warm and gooey when I got home.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It was hard on her,\" said Giles softly. \"She held up remarkably well.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"She was amazing,\" Buffy agreed sadly. \"And it took me so long to see it. It was almost too late.\" She let out a sigh that held the edges of tears though her eyes were still dry.</p>\n\
    <p>\"But such are teenagers,\" Giles replied gently. \"No one ever knows as much as they do about anything.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Were we really as awful as I remember?\" she asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you really want to know?\" There was a teasing twinkle in Giles's eye as he said this, lightening the mood.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Buffy, think of Dawn and multiply by three,\" Xander suggested. He, Buffy, and Willow had probably broken every school rule there was for their regular teachers, and poor Giles had had to deal with them the rest of the time along with their significant others. \"And add a factor of ten for Cordelia,\" he added at the thought of his ex-girlfriend.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uhhgg. I am never having kids,\" Buffy declared.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, because that plan works out, oh so well,\" said Giles dryly surprising a bark of laughter out of Xander and a wide eyed look from Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Great,\" she said resettling. \"I can just see myself in ten years, old and fat, clucking over my glasses at my slayers about doing their homework.\" The image of her little and old made Xander laugh again that prompted an arch look from the 'little old lady.'</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wouldn't worry Buffy,\" he said consolingly. \"You'll never be fat or wear glasses.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll still be old,\" she grumbled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And this is a bad thing?\" asked Giles.</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy turned to him a smiled, serious now. \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I guess . . . I'm still getting used to the idea that I've got at life beyond twenty-five.\" Giles smiled back, as did Xander, the three of them sharing mutual love and hope for a better life for all of them. Leaving Sunnydale had been like breaking free of a curse, and traveling America and Europe looking for slayers had been the best medicine for all the hurt and pain they'd suffered. The trip had shown them that despite all the bad stuff \xE2\x80\x93 vampires, corrupt cops, human crime, global climate change \xE2\x80\x93 there was still so much to live for in the world, so much to fight for. There were puppies and basketball games and carnivals and cafes and Yosemite Park and people. Millions and billions of people who loved life too.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander knew it wasn't all black and white, he'd need only look at their own lives to see that, and he was cynical enough to ask twice what the catch was. Good people messed up, bad people changed for the better, and everyone was just struggling through life as best they could. It was having that chance to struggle that was important. Hope. Somehow it was easier to see outside of Sunnydale.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So Xander, how's the dad thing going?\" Buffy broke the silence that had fallen over them like a warm blanket. \"He didn't look too happy at dinner.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander thought back over their stilted conversation on the porch that hadn't done anything it seemed except reinforce the gap between them. \"He's not happy about any of it. His work's classified and no one is supposed to know about it.\" Jack hadn't appeared too angry though, just tired and worried. \"I think he was more upset about us fighting vampires for a living.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"This from a guy who's friends with an alien?\" asked Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I suspect his problem arises more from the existence of the supernatural,\" said Giles. \"Dr. Jackson and Major Carter earlier were trying to rationalize everything with science. Honestly, I couldn't understand half of what they were saying, but they were more concerned with the reasons behind the belief than the actual beliefs.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Thinking back on it, Xander wasn't so sure. \"Not Jack,\" he disagreed. \"He had a problem with us fighting. 'Kids'. Basically told me he wanted me to stop because it was too dangerous.\"</p>\n\
    <p>A ghost of a smile flittered over Buffy's face at that news. \"I like him,\" she said. \"Not that you should stop,\" she quickly added, suddenly worried Xander might take it the wrong way, \"but it's cool that he asked.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So I can keep him?\" Xander joked, but internally giddy that Jack had won Buffy's approval.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, I think you would be foolish to let him go,\" said Giles, making Xander this time look at the other man in surprise. Giles was actually for Jack now? After all the hemming and hawing about the American military and casual questions about his visits and general disapproving vibes? Xander was so startled, he just stared at the one adult that had been constant in his life and who now smiled knowingly back at him, clearly amused by his frank disbelief that he approved.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xand, you're gonna catch flies if you leave your jaw there,\" said Buffy with a giggle. Abruptly, he shut his mouth and looked from one to the other.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's been good for you,\" said Giles still smiling like he knew everything. \"And I must say that I'm impressed he has not disappeared on you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't think I could get him to if I wanted it,\" Xander replied, finally over most of his shock and decidedly happy about Giles's sudden support.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just as long as the military thing doesn't backfire on us,\" said Buffy. \"If it does I reserve the right to blow up their mountain.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know I'm going to regret asking, but why blow it up?\" asked Giles wincing in anticipation.</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy shrugged impishly. \"I'm better at blowing up stuff. Three for two record, you know.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Besides,\" Xander couldn't help but add. \"Finding the mountain would be a hell of a lot easier than going after the people involved.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Plus, we could give them time to evacuate,\" said Buffy magnanimously, as if utter destruction were not her goal. Giles merely regarded them calmly, unfazed by their plan.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just as long as I am not in the country when you do so,\" was all he said. He stood up and grimaced from moving stiff muscles. \"Either of you like tea?\" he asked as his back popped.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Coffee.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hot chocolate,\" they requested. Giles shook his head at them but nodded anyway and left for the kitchen. Xander and Buffy just stayed on the comfy couch, too lazy to move.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You really like Jack?\" Xander asked a minute later.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Buffy sighed, turning her head towards him and smiling. \"I do. He's around, you know? You guys visit. He calls. Sometimes I wish my dad would bother himself about it, but then I remember how much I don't like him. But I like Jack. He's a lot like you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Witty and ridiculously good looking?\" Xander joked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He could pass for cute,\" said Buffy with the devil in her eye. Xander threw his head back against the couch.</p>\n\
    <p>\"First Dawn, now you!\" he groaned.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dawn said he was cute?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Not Jack, Daniel. Which is marginally better I guess. At least he's not supposed to be my father.\" He looked critically at Buffy and tried thinking about her and Jack. It was a bad idea. \"I need therapy,\" he said. \"I think I just scarred myself for life.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why?\" asked Buffy giving him a quizzical look at his odd statement.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander's mouth opened to share before he could stop it. \"You as my stepmom. I will never forgive you if that happens.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy looked at him a little stricken by that, and then burst out laughing. After a second, Xander joined in. The idea was ridiculous and so completely beyond messed up, but stranger things had happened. It felt good to laugh, like all the uncertainty and stress just drained away from his chest, down his arms, and out his fingertips, leaving only a relaxed tiredness behind. By the time Giles came in a few minutes later, their laughter had melted into spurts of giggles. The Head Watcher simply handed them two steaming mugs and quirked an eyebrow.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Trust me, you don't want to know,\" Buffy told him as she accepted her hot chocolate.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do either of you have objections to putting up Colonel O'Neill and his friends for the night?\" Giles took her advice to heart.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shrugged. \"No, why?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, he just told me they were going to have to leave soon to get back to the base they're staying at. I thought why not stay here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sure, but I want Willow or someone to put an alarm on their door.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Buffy,\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, we're not chaining them up, but they could still be dangerous,\" the Slayer overrode his protest. \"It's just in case. They won't even know it's there.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Unable to argue with that logic, and knowing he wouldn't win anyway if he did, Xander agreed to it. \"Okay,\" he sighed. \"I'll go ask them.\" With that, he pulled himself to his feet and went in search of Jack.</p>\n\
    <hr>\"Hey Jack,\" Xander's voice interrupted the discussion around the dining room table. Jack and his team were solidifying what they knew and trying to come up with a report for Hammond and possibly Davis about the situation here. Top on his list of recommendations was a program that eliminated the need for underage slayers.<p>\"Xander, what's up?\" he asked as his son joined them at the table with a cup of coffee. Jack wondered if there was any left in the kitchen.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Giles said you have to leave soon. Do you wanna just stay here for the night?\" he asked. \"We've got plenty of space.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That'd be great,\" Jack smiled, not very surprised by the offer but glad for it nonetheless. They needed to be back here in the morning anyway to see about the rogue NID agents and it would save them a long drive each way.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Cool. So whatcha doing here?\" Xander turned his attention to the looseleaf paper Jack was writing on. \"'Intelligence, armament . . .' You planning a war or something?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, yeah,\" said Jack carefully. Considering the way Andrew had blown up over this, he wasn't too sure he was ready for Xander's reaction to his little brainchild. He cast looks to Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c, silently asking them if he should broach the subject.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We were actually thinking of what we could do to help,\" said Daniel, ever the diplomat. \"From what you've told us, it sounds like a pretty big job protecting the world from vampires from out of Cleveland.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So when you say help, you mean have the military come in with intelligence and weapons and just do the job for us?\" Xander looked from Daniel to Jack questioningly. So far, no explosions, that was good.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That would be the long term goal,\" said Carter. \"With such a big project we would need a transition period but the ultimate goal is that the need for slayers would be gone.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Gone.\" Xander let out a half laugh of disbelief, pulling Jack's piece of paper over and looking at it one more time. \"You have no idea what you're talking about, do you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>A little taken aback by this response, Jack lifted his eyebrows and suggested, \"Vampires? Ugly evil things? Look, I know we're new to this stuff, but there's got to be a better way to fight them than with little girls.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander leveled his eye on him. \"And what about the next hell god or when the First makes his next move? Will your soldiers be able to handle that?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"True gods do not exist,\" said Teal'c, but Xander wasn't smiling when he turned to the Jaffa.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah? Tell that to someone who wasn't there.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack glanced down the table at Daniel and Carter who looked just as bewildered as he felt. But Xander went on.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's not just vampires,\" he said sitting back in his chair so he could see them all more easily. \"And it's not just demons you can kill by shooting. There are a lot of things out there, that trying to shoot them full of bullets will just piss them off. Intelligence isn't just finding out where they are either.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We realize it's not that simple,\" said Jack a little annoyed at being talked down to. \"This is just a start.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're talking about setting up a system we already have in place,\" Xander replied.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh?\" said Jack. This was news. Where was this marvelous system then? \"You have people gathering info on all hostile movements? Backup standing by for Willow and Kennedy? Measures in place in case someone tries to end the world?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Great. Jack sighed impatiently. That was hardly an answer and all this was getting nowhere. \"Xander, training hardly counts. We're talking about an organized defense against all the supernatural crap. No more kids fighting and dying.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Taking them out of the action won't protect them,\" Xander shook his head. \"You need the supernatural to fight the supernatural, and that's the slayers. They're drawn to it. Half your soldiers will be dead in their first skirmish. I'm not kidding, Jack,\" he added when the older man opened his mouth to protest. He was dead serious. \"I know you don't like it,\" he said a little more softly. \"Most of the time I don't like it either, but more people will die if we don't do it our way.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What's the system you have?\" Carter asked into the ensuing silence. Xander broke off his staring contest with Jack and smiled sourly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Welcome to the North American Headquarters of the International Watchers Council,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"International Watcher's Council?\" Jack repeated, not sure he was hearing this. He looked around at the china cabinet and the framed Ansel Adams posters on the walls. \"Here?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"This is just the central operations room,\" said Xander dryly, \"also known three times a day as the dining room.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're saying that you run an international organization against vampires out of the dining room?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shrugged. \"It's the table. Giles actually runs the international part as Head of the Watchers. I just take care of the slayers in North America, though Mexico and all those little countries down there are getting transferred to the South American office once Willow gets set up.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Mr. North America,\" Jack recalled Xander's confusing statement from that morning. Xander was responsible for maintaining the safety of an entire continent? That was insane!</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why have you been chosen for these positions?\" asked Teal'c. \"Would it not be more fitting for an elder generation to carry out these duties?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Because the 'elder generation' also known as the Stuffy Assholes in England Who Thought They Knew What Was Going On But Really Didn't went kablewie two years ago,\" Xander said, a little irritated. \"Giles and about fifteen people he's found since then are all that's left of the old Council. That left us with a whole lot of new slayers all over the place so we decided to reform the council so that it would actually help the Slayer instead of try to enslave her.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Wait a minute,\" said Jack, holding up a hand to slow him down. There had been a bit too much information for him to process in that last explanation. \"There was another organization before you, who did the same thing?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No.\" Xander corrected him. \"There was an older Council that claimed to do the same thing. The Slayer was just their tool in the fight. They didn't really do anything except cause trouble for us. It was about power,\" he practically spat the same word Andrew had used earlier. \"We still do what we've always done just on a bigger scale now that there are more slayers.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"More slayers?\" asked Daniel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"There used to be one, Buffy. And I am so not explaining right now. Point is, we're set up to handle it. You'd just be getting in our way.\"</p>\n\
    <p>More complications, Jack figured. He could feel a headache coming on already. It sounded like some serious history, for what was clicking together in Jack's head was the timeframe. Two years ago Xander had lost his eye, Sunnydale had sunk into the ground, and his girlfriend had died. That sounded like too much of a coincidence for comfort. He almost asked what had happened but decided to wait until he and Xander were alone. Instead, he simply watched his son as Daniel tried to convince him that quitting would give him a chance at a better life, but Xander wasn't having any of it. Jack saw the same determination in his eye that had been there out on the porch, when he'd asked about it. Xander was in too deep. 'I'm talking about my life,' he'd said just that morning. Jack had thought earlier that maybe he would see reason and let the soldiers take over, but once again, Xander's deep seated mistrust of the military wouldn't give ground, no matter what Daniel said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Look, the last time you guys tried to take over we had to bail you out,\" Xander brought Jack crashing back to the present. \"So just forget it already. The government tries to take over again we'll stop you. And trust me when I say you don't want to get Buffy or Willow mad.\" But it was his first statement that got Jack's attention.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What do you mean 'the last time we took over'?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander sighed, obviously wishing he hadn't said anything. \"It was called the Initiative. Top secret, obviously. Ended with a lot of dead soldiers. The ones that made it only did because we stepped in. They didn't know what they were dealing with; you don't know what you're dealing with. And I don't care about your good intentions, there's always going to be some mad scientist who wants to play god and damn the consequences. So I'm telling you now, we will not let that happen again. If it does I'd stay away from that mountain of yours.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack sat up at the words that sounded ominously like a threat. \"Why?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander glanced at him then at the others. \"Buffy said something about blowing it up,\" he said casually. And something in the way he said it made Jack certain he wasn't joking around. \"Come on,\" Xander abruptly stood up, effectively putting an end to the conversation. \"I'll show you where you're staying.\" He left the room by way of the kitchen, and as Jack and his team got up to follow him, he knew that they'd be spending the night talking instead of sleeping.</p>\n\
    <hr>AN: Honestly, I don't know how I feel about this chapter. For those that feel as ambiguous about it as I do, I think the next few chapters will make up for it, and they will definitely be out sooner."

    18.1 Cursors: the 'cursor' property
    
    'cursor'
        Value:  	[ [ ,]* [ auto | crosshair | default | pointer | move | e-resize | ne-resize | nw-resize | n-resize | se-resize | sw-resize | s-resize | w-resize | text | wait | help | progress ] ] | inherit
        Initial:  	auto
        Applies to:  	all elements
        Inherited:  	yes
        Percentages:  	N/A
        Media:  	visual, interactive
        Computed value:  	as specified, except with any relative URLs converted to absolute
    
    This property specifies the type of cursor to be displayed for the pointing device. Values have the following meanings:
    
    auto
        The UA determines the cursor to display based on the current context.
    crosshair
        A simple crosshair (e.g., short line segments resembling a "+" sign). 
    default
        The platform-dependent default cursor. Often rendered as an arrow. 
    pointer
        The cursor is a pointer that indicates a link. 
    move
        Indicates something is to be moved. 
    e-resize, ne-resize, nw-resize, n-resize, se-resize, sw-resize, s-resize, w-resize
        Indicate that some edge is to be moved. For example, the 'se-resize' cursor is used when the movement starts from the south-east corner of the box. 
    text
        Indicates text that may be selected. Often rendered as an I-beam. 
    wait
        Indicates that the program is busy and the user should wait. Often rendered as a watch or hourglass. 
    progress
        A progress indicator. The program is performing some processing, but is different from 'wait' in that the user may still interact with the program. Often rendered as a spinning beach ball, or an arrow with a watch or hourglass. 
    help
        Help is available for the object under the cursor. Often rendered as a question mark or a balloon. 
    
        The user agent retrieves the cursor from the resource designated by the URI. If the user agent cannot handle the first cursor of a list of cursors, it should attempt to handle the second, etc. If the user agent cannot handle any user-defined cursor, it must use the generic cursor at the end of the list. Intrinsic sizes for cursors are calculated as for background images, except that a UA-defined rectangle is used in place of the rectangle that establishes the coordinate system for the 'background-image' property. This UA-defined rectangle should be based on the size of a typical cursor on the UA's operating system. If the resulting cursor size does not fit within this rectangle, the UA may proportionally scale the resulting cursor down until it fits within the rectangle.
    
    Example(s):
    
    
    :link,:visited { cursor: url(example.svg#linkcursor), url(hyper.cur), pointer }
    
    This example sets the cursor on all hyperlinks (whether visited or not) to an external SVG cursor. User agents that do not support SVG cursors would simply skip to the next value and attempt to use the "hyper.cur" cursor. If that cursor format was also not supported, the UA would skip to the next value and simply render the 'pointer' cursor.
    18.2 System Colors
    
    Note. The System Colors are deprecated in the CSS3 Color Module [CSS3COLOR].
    
    In addition to being able to assign pre-defined color values to text, backgrounds, etc., CSS2 introduced a set of named color values that allows authors to specify colors in a manner that integrates them into the operating system's graphic environment.
    
    For systems that do not have a corresponding value, the specified value should be mapped to the nearest system value, or to a default color.
    
    The following lists additional values for color-related CSS properties and their general meaning. Any color property (e.g., 'color' or 'background-color') can take one of the following names. Although these are case-insensitive, it is recommended that the mixed capitalization shown below be used, to make the names more legible.
    
    ActiveBorder
        Active window border.
    ActiveCaption
        Active window caption.
    AppWorkspace
        Background color of multiple document interface.
    Background
        Desktop background.
    ButtonFace
        Face color for three-dimensional display elements.
    ButtonHighlight
        Highlight color for three-dimensional display elements (for edges facing away from the light source).
    ButtonShadow
        Shadow color for three-dimensional display elements.
    ButtonText
        Text on push buttons.
    CaptionText
        Text in caption, size box, and scrollbar arrow box.
    GrayText
        Grayed (disabled) text. This color is set to #000 if the current display driver does not support a solid gray color.
    Highlight
        Item(s) selected in a control.
    HighlightText
        Text of item(s) selected in a control.
    InactiveBorder
        Inactive window border.
    InactiveCaption
        Inactive window caption.
    InactiveCaptionText
        Color of text in an inactive caption.
    InfoBackground
        Background color for tooltip controls.
    InfoText
        Text color for tooltip controls.
    Menu
        Menu background.
    MenuText
        Text in menus.
    Scrollbar
        Scroll bar gray area.
    ThreeDDarkShadow
        Dark shadow for three-dimensional display elements.
    ThreeDFace
        Face color for three-dimensional display elements.
    ThreeDHighlight
        Highlight color for three-dimensional display elements.
    ThreeDLightShadow
        Light color for three-dimensional display elements (for edges facing the light source).
    ThreeDShadow
        Dark shadow for three-dimensional display elements.
    Window
        Window background.
    WindowFrame
        Window frame.
    WindowText
        Text in windows.
    
    Example(s):
    
    For example, to set the foreground and background colors of a paragraph to the same foreground and background colors of the user's window, write the following:
    
    
    p { color: WindowText; background-color: Window }
    
    18.3 User preferences for fonts
    
    As for colors, authors may specify fonts in a way that makes use of a user's system resources. Please consult the 'font' property for details.
    18.4 Dynamic outlines: the 'outline' property
    
    At times, style sheet authors may want to create outlines around visual objects such as buttons, active form fields, image maps, etc., to make them stand out. CSS 2.1 outlines differ from borders in the following ways:
    
       1. Outlines do not take up space.
       2. Outlines may be non-rectangular.
    
    The outline properties control the style of these dynamic outlines.
    
    'outline'
        Value:  	[ &lt;'outline-color'> || &lt;'outline-style'> || &lt;'outline-width'> ] | inherit
        Initial:  	see individual properties
        Applies to:  	all elements
        Inherited:  	no
        Percentages:  	N/A
        Media:  	visual, interactive
        Computed value:  	see individual properties
    
    'outline-width'
        Value:  	 | inherit
        Initial:  	medium
        Applies to:  	all elements
        Inherited:  	no
        Percentages:  	N/A
        Media:  	visual, interactive
        Computed value:  	absolute length; '0' if the outline style is 'none'
    
    'outline-style'
        Value:  	 | inherit
        Initial:  	none
        Applies to:  	all elements
        Inherited:  	no
        Percentages:  	N/A
        Media:  	visual, interactive
        Computed value:  	as specified
    
    'outline-color'
        Value:  	 | invert | inherit
        Initial:  	invert
        Applies to:  	all elements
        Inherited:  	no
        Percentages:  	N/A
        Media:  	visual, interactive
        Computed value:  	as specified
    
    The outline created with the outline properties is drawn "over" a box, i.e., the outline is always on top, and does not influence the position or size of the box, or of any other boxes. Therefore, displaying or suppressing outlines does not cause reflow or overflow.
    
    The outline may be drawn starting just outside the border edge.
    
    Outlines may be non-rectangular. For example, if the element is broken across several lines, the outline is the minimum outline that encloses all the element's boxes. In contrast to borders, the outline is not open at the line box's end or start, but is always fully connected if possible.
    
    The 'outline-width' property accepts the same values as 'border-width'.
    
    The 'outline-style' property accepts the same values as 'border-style', except that 'hidden' is not a legal outline style.
    
    The 'outline-color' accepts all colors, as well as the keyword 'invert'. 'Invert' is expected to perform a color inversion on the pixels on the screen. This is a common trick to ensure the focus border is visible, regardless of color background.
    
    Conformant UAs may ignore the 'invert' value on platforms that do not support color inversion of the pixels on the screen. If the UA does not support the 'invert' value then the initial value of the 'outline-color' property is the value of the 'color' property, similar to the initial value of the 'border-top-color' property.
    
    The 'outline' property is a shorthand property, and sets all three of 'outline-style', 'outline-width', and 'outline-color'.
    
    Note. The outline is the same on all sides. In contrast to borders, there is no 'outline-top' or 'outline-left' property.
    
    This specification does not define how multiple overlapping outlines are drawn, or how outlines are drawn for boxes that are partially obscured behind other elements.
    
    Note. Since the outline does not affect formatting (i.e., no space is left for it in the box model), it may well overlap other elements on the page.
    
    Example(s):
    
    Here's an example of drawing a thick outline around a BUTTON element:
    
    
    button { outline : thick solid}
    
    Scripts may be used to dynamically change the width of the outline, without provoking a reflow.
    18.4.1 Outlines and the focus
    
    Graphical user interfaces may use outlines around elements to tell the user which element on the page has the focus. These outlines are in addition to any borders, and switching outlines on and off should not cause the document to reflow. The focus is the subject of user interaction in a document (e.g., for entering text, selecting a button, etc.). User agents supporting the interactive media group must keep track of where the focus lies and must also represent the focus. This may be done by using dynamic outlines in conjunction with the :focus pseudo-class.
    
    Example(s):
    
    For example, to draw a thick black line around an element when it has the focus, and a thick red line when it is active, the following rules can be used:
    
    
    :focus  { outline: thick solid black }
    :active { outline: thick solid red }
    
    18.5 Magnification
    
    The CSS working group considers that the magnification of a document or portions of a document should not be specified through style sheets. User agents may support such magnification in different ways (e.g., larger images, louder sounds, etc.)
    
    When magnifying a page, UAs should preserve the relationships between positioned elements. For example, a comic strip may be composed of images with overlaid text elements. When magnifying this page, a user agent should keep the text within the comic strip balloon.

    Section 22: Rabbit Holes<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>The tension on Lo'la steadily increased the closer they got to the planet. Jack sat on the floor in the back with his team and Aeryn while D'argo and John piloted, monitoring as many as the Qujagan frequencies as possible for any sign of the warlord's soldiers. So far, Lo'la's invisibility had kept them under the radar. The earlier argument among the aliens had dissolved into an agreement to go to the planet and decide there. If they were detected and attacked, they would need all the help they could get.</p>
    <p>Out the window the gray blue planet drew closer and closer until it filled up the view. "The stargate is in the main city?" asked D'argo when they entered a low orbit.</p>
    <p>"In a huge junkyard in the bad part of town," Jack told him. He looked at the dazzling planet with trepidation. So far everything was fine. He just hoped it stayed that way.</p>
    <p>They orbited the planet once to get in position for atmospheric entry, then descended. "So far so good," John muttered.</p>
    <p>"There," said D'argo pointing to a buildingless patch in the city that grew larger as they descended towards it. Everyone crowded to the front looking for the black ring on the ground.</p>
    <p>"Any sign of the Qujagans?" asked Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"Nope, we're still in the clear."</p>
    <p>"You guys see anything?"</p>
    <p>"Wait. There," Daniel pointed. And there it was, lying on the ground just where they had left it.</p>
    <p>"Alright campers, let's get down there."</p>
    <p>Ten minutes later, the seven of them stood around the stargate, four with relief at returning to what was familiar, the others with a mixture of curiosity and loathing. "Neat," was the only comment John tonelessly offered for the three of them. Irked a little by their lack of reaction, Jack prodded everyone into action.</p>
    <p>"Carter, let's hook her up."</p>
    <p>With the help of John and Aeryn, Moya's resident mechanics, Carter connected the stargate to Lo'la's engines so they could power the gate. Jack, Daniel, Teal'c and D'argo helped out with the heavy lifting, but otherwise stayed out of their way. The colonel made the mistake of getting too close to where they were wrapping stripped cable wire around the leads to the stargate and ended up getting zapped by something or other. Carter immediately jumped up to make sure the precious cable was still intact, only belatedly asking him if he was okay.</p>
    <p>"Well, I think that's it," Carter announced a few minutes later. "Let's try it out."</p>
    <p>D'argo fired up the engines. The stargate began to hum and vibrate against the ground. Jack took the grin on Carter's face as a good sign. "Teal'c, Daniel, dial us home."</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>It wasn't until the fifth triangle lit up on the stargate that John noticed the buzzing. Except it wasn't a buzzing so much as the sound of flight. Something big, like . . .oh frell. "I think we have a problem."</p>
    <p>"What?" five people asked in unison. John ignored the eyes on him and looked up at the sky. The others followed his gaze to the cloudless sky above them, as they too listened.</p>
    <p>"Aw, crap," Jack summed up. It was definitely a ship or plane that was coming closer to them.</p>
    <p>"Can they detect that Lo'la's engines running, even if we're not in flight?" asked Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"I have no idea," D'argo replied.</p>
    <p>"Well let's not wait around guessing," Jack snapped everyone's attention back to the ground. "Come on, we've got two chevrons left and we're out of here." Quickly, the three male members of SG-1 put their backs into spinning the inner wheel of the gate.</p>
    <p>"As soon as it's locked, stand back," Sam ordered the rest of them. A moment later John saw why as a huge jet of swirling wormhole shot out of the stargate into the air before settling into a shimmering blue pool like water. John was impressed in spite of himself. A stable wormhole on a planet, now that was pretty cool.</p>
    <p>Above them the sound of engines intensified, and three rounded fighters came into view. They and their shattering weapons would be in range in moments.</p>
    <p>"Let's go, people!" Jack shouted from the edge of the wormhole, waving a hand for them to hurry up.</p>
    <p>"Guess we're all jumping down the rabbit hole," John commented as the rest of them gathered around grabbing hands to form a seven person chain. John was in the middle between Daniel and Sam. He took a brief microt to slow down his breathing and his thoughts before taking the final step.</p>
    <p>"Now!"</p>
    <p>Jumping through the stargate was nothing like John's previous wormhole travelling. For starters, he felt tingly and cold from the atomization of his body that Sam had described to him. John chose not to think about it too much. Instead he focused on what it sounded like. This wormhole was a lot smaller than he was used to and places echoed a little bit differently.  As they sped along he stretched out his senses, searching for the right hum that resonated in time with the atomized people beside him.</p>
    <p>Not quite sure how he did it, John pulled them along the wormhole. He could feel them getting closer and closer and then suddenly they were there. Without hesitating, he dragged them through. The edges of this exit were not quite like the others, but it sounded like Daniel sounded and smelt like Sam smelt.</p>
    <p>Once free of the odd exit John felt a jolt as everything shifted, realigning his perception in this new wormhole. His 'time sense' suddenly stopped barraging his brain. But even without the complication of when to come out, John still felt too many exits. With no other choice, he simply guessed and hoped for the best.</p>
    <p>Dazed and disoriented, John felt a rush as his body was put back together and spat onto the ground. Sandy dirt met his face and he resisted the urge to spew his guts up. All around he could hear shuffling feet and the clang of metal, but John was too focused on getting to his knees to care.</p>
    <p>"Aw, crap!" Jack swore for the second time that day.</p>
    <p>Shaking off the last of his nausea, John looked up. What he saw wasn't encouraging. SG-1 were all on their feet and unaffected by whatever had hit him coming out of the wormhole. And right in front of them were twenty big guys dressed in metal plate armor with black tattoos stamped across their foreheads. None of them were smiling. In fact, each one was pointing a weapon like Teal'c's at the group of travelers.</p>
    <p>"Bad guys?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Bad guys," Jack confirmed as he lifted his hands in surrender.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>There! On the other side of the wormhole!</p>

    <p>OK, I'm a liar. This part is definitely out later than both you and I expected, but Real Life decided to live up to its reputation of being not fair and very busy. I think that's the nicest and briefest way I can describe the last few weeks.</p>\n\
    <p>I don't think a chapter has sparked such interesting discussion before. I'd like to thank everyone for sharing their thoughts on 10. Since I've already replied to many of your reviews, I don't really have anything to add except thanks. For those reading on  I suggest going to .com where you can read my replies to reviews. I don't take any reviews badly and I never flame anyone, so please don't hesitate to leave your email address so I can reply to issues raised. (cough \xE2\x80\x93 'some person' \xE2\x80\x93 cough).</p>\n\
    <p>Anyway, onward.</p>\n\
    <hr>Eleventh Hour Tango<hr>Force of habit woke Jack around six thirty the following morning. It took him a moment to register why the sun was shining from the wrong direction before the sight of the bunk above him reminded him where he was. Xander had put them up in Diana and Vi's room that had two sets of bunkbeds and its own bathroom. Unlike the guest room that he had stayed in over Thanksgiving, this room was well decorated with the lives of two teenage girls. Movie and band posters were on the walls, photos of friends were stuck into the mirror, and pastel colored curtains hung from the top bunks giving the room a homey feel. To look at it, he would never have guessed that the two girls fought vampires on a nightly basis.<p>He and SG-1 had stayed up the better part of the night talking about everything they had learned thus far, especially Xander's denial of help the night before. And all the other little bombshells he had dropped along the way, namely the Watcher's Council and the Initiative project. Daniel had quickly jumped to their defense, saying they couldn't really blame Xander for resisting what he essentially saw as a hostile takeover, even if it would benefit them in the end. Jack hadn't really argued; they'd run into too many situations offworld where this had happened for him not to see the broader cultural implications. But it still didn't change the fact that having kids on the front line was wrong, and since they were dealing with the kids themselves, it was going to be very difficult to get them to see this. Jack wasn't about to give up though.</p>\n\
    <p>Other than convincing Xander that they needed help, Jack needed to call the General today to report and Carter wanted to call her contact at the NID \xE2\x80\x93 the legit branch \xE2\x80\x93 to see if he knew anything. Yesterday's revelations had completely sidetracked Jack from the actual matter at hand, namely Kinsey, the rogue NID, and how they were going to handle this mess, especially now that it had just gotten messier. He was positively dreading his call to Hammond.</p>\n\
    <p>Unable to sleep anymore, Jack got up and went to the bathroom. He really hoped today was better than yesterday. Maybe with everyone rested and not pulling secrets out of their hats, they could get something accomplished. Daniel and Teal'c were stirring when he returned, woken no doubt by his movements, while Carter was still curled up under the covers. Jack told them to go back to sleep in a whisper since he doubted anyone else would be up at such an early hour. Quickly, he dressed as quietly as he could and left the room, padding softly down the stairs. The house was peaceful for once though as he drew closer to the kitchen, Jack heard soft voices.</p>\n\
    <p>The kitchen was empty but a quick peak into the dining room showed Dawn and Courtney in their pajamas pouring over a laptop on the table. Neither one of them noticed him so absorbed were they in their work. Dawn seemed to be showing Courtney how to do something so Jack drew back from sight wondering why they were up this early but not wanting to intrude. Instead he kept an ear open as he searched the cabinets for coffee fixings.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow showed me this one,\" Dawn was saying. \"It's easier if you go to advanced search then try to do it there. That's down here.\" A few mouse clicks. \"Then you type in the keywords,\" now the sound of typing, \"author,\" more typing, \"and sorted by date, latest first.\" Another few clicks then, \"Voila! All the papers and abstracts written by Dr. Jackson.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack's head shot up at this last. His attention riveted on the other room, he stared at the door as if he could see through it. Looking into Daniel now were they? Oh, this couldn't be good. It took all of his self control not to go in there and find out what they had found. And how the hell did they find every paper he'd ever written on the internet?</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's a lot of papers,\" Courtney commented quietly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"They're probably not all the same person,\" said Dawn. \"We can eliminate all these down here cause they're too old for him. Now we'll go through the rest and see what looks right.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Won't they all be right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nope. The computer just grabs everything that matches, even if it doesn't fit exactly what we're looking for. See? Jackson, C. We don't care about what he wrote. Here, you want to go through and get all the Ds?\" He heard some shuffling as the two girls must have traded places, then footsteps and he quickly turned away from the door and tried to look like he hadn't been listening.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack,\" said Dawn stopping short at the open door that separated the two rooms. \"You're up early,\" she said recovering. She headed over to the fridge with her head held stubbornly up, deliberately not looking at him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Couldn't sleep,\" he replied as she pulled out the orange juice and turned to the cabinet for glasses.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Us either,\" said Dawn. She poured two glasses of OJ then looked up and said helpfully, \"filters are in the one to the right.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thanks.\" He turned to the cabinet she indicated. He heard her go back into the dining room while he fixed himself coffee.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think I got them all,\" he heard Courtney report then Dawn showed her how to do the next step of downloading the files they wanted. Next thing he knew, a printer was going in the background. Deciding he better interrupt before they read the papers from who-knows-who's-computers, Jack quickly scooped ground coffee into the filter, filled the top with water and set it to drip. A moment later he was in the dining room with two faces looking up at his abrupt entrance.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey kids! Whatcha doing?\" Jack asked cheerfully as if he didn't know what they were up to. Courtney looked anxiously at Dawn but the older girl just shrugged, not seeming to care that he knew, her head again lifting slightly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Research,\" she said vaguely looking back at the computer screen.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Wouldn't happen to be on, oh say, Daniel would it?\" asked Jack in the same sarcastically cheerful tone.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's a matter of public record,\" said Dawn primly cutting her eyes at him, daring him to challenge her actions. \"Perfectly legal.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh huh.\" Jack didn't believe her. \"So where did you get the papers? They were just lying on the internet?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Actually yes,\" she said smugly. \"Database of academic journals and everything they've ever published.\" She looked at him triumphantly, her eyes saying 'beat that.'</p>\n\
    <p>\"What makes you think you'll find anything in there?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What makes you think we won't?\" she countered. \"We have to start somewhere, unless you want to fill us in . . .\" she trailed off hopefully.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Does the word 'classified' mean anything to you?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Interesting?\" Dawn suggested impishly. Jack had to stop an eye roll at that, wishing she would just drop it. Poking around Daniel's past papers wouldn't yield much direct information but it would lead to other questions that Jack would much rather not have raised. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be much he could do about Dawn's curiosity at the moment short of breaking her computer, and all that would accomplish would be postponing the inevitable and making her hate him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Some things are better left alone,\" he said quietly, hoping to impress upon her the gravity of the situation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And some things shouldn't be ignored,\" said Dawn. Her large eyes caught Jack's in a gaze that was both enchanting and too old for the face that held it. It wouldn't matter what Jack said; she was going to look into it anyway. Nothing could stop that now. With a resigned and frustrated sigh, Jack went back into the kitchen and stared at the coffee maker trying to straighten everything out in his head, but his thoughts were a tangled mess. It wouldn't hurt anyone if they knew and kept it to themselves, but if they told others or let something slip or if the wrong people wanted to keep them quiet . . . There was more than one way to ruin a life, most a lot more unpleasant than a frontal attack \xE2\x80\x93 blacklisting, anonymous tips to local cops, a random hit-and-run accident crossing the street. Jack sighed. He'd seen them all, and damn it he didn't want that to happen to anyone here, but what could he do? What a mess indeed.</p>\n\
    <p>He was still thinking about it, and his options if the worst occurred when the coffee finally finished and even twenty minutes later when it was finally late enough for him to call the General. As much as he didn't want to make the call he was glad to be distracted. He fished out his cell phone that was secured for just these purposes and stepped outside to dial the Mountain.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hammond,\" the General answered the phone briskly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good Morning, General,\" said Jack with a cheerfulness he didn't feel. Oh, this was not going to be fun.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel O'Neill, how's the situation in Cleveland?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, still here,\" said Jack. \"Xander really does have the NID locked up in his basement. I'm gonna call the base and get someone to pick them up.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did he explain how he managed to get them there?\" the General asked calmly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're not going to like it,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel.\" He could hear Hammond frowning at him over the line.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, so,\" here went nothing, \"do you believe in magic?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel.\" The General's frown increased.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know it sounds ludicrous. Believe me, I know,\" he ran his free hand through his hair. Once more he couldn't believe he was defending the idea. \"But just hear me out. Xander and his friends claim to use magic, and unless they're hiding some Asguard technology somewhere . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel, you're saying that your son and a few friends aided by magic captured a team of the Black Ops trained soldiers?\" Disbelief colored every syllable.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, sir. I don't have all the details yet of what exactly happened,\" Jack said, \"but I did see the commandos sitting in the basement being held prisoner by a force field that is not being produced by any technology that I could see anywhere in the house.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What about some other technology that we are not aware of,\" said Hammond, latching onto a rationalization for Jack's insane babble. \"Are they another alien race we haven't encountered yet?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Could be, but I doubt it,\" said Jack. The thought had crossed his mind last night but the kids didn't act anything but human and had been all too surprised at the revelation that Teal'c was an alien. Xander was human; there was no doubt of that. And Jack couldn't forget the sight of Andrew's bite mark that looked like it came out of a Dracula movie. No, if they were aliens, they had at least been born on Earth and had a vested interest in protecting the planet. Ironically, it was this explanation that Jack should have believed but didn't. \"You want the really bad news?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Bad news?\" Hammond practically growled. Yeah, he wasn't happy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Two of Xander's friends hacked the SGC, NID, and Groom Lake computers.\" Silence on the other end. Jack figured he might as well tell him the rest before the storm broke. \"And one of them figured out by <i>looking</i> at Teal'c that he wasn't from Earth.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel,\" the General's voice was heavy. \"If they aren't another alien race, I hope you have a very good explanation for this.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Magic?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel O'Neill.\" Clearly the General still didn't believe him if the increase in volume was any indication.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sir, that was Xander's explanation, and as crazy as it is I believe him,\" Jack immediately jumped in. \"There's more.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"More?!\" Hammond was about to blow a gasket and Jack was suddenly very grateful he was halfway across the country at the moment.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, sir,\" said Jack. \"Now I know this is going to sound just as insane but try to keep an open mind. I didn't want to believe it either but too much of it fits together.\" Jack took a deep breath to steel himself. \"There's another war going on against vampires and demons,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>Hammond was silent. Jack gritted his teeth and squinted his eyes in preparation for the explosion, but in the end what came was far scarier. \"Colonel, I sincerely hope you are pulling my leg,\" the General said in a deadly quiet voice.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sir, I wish to God I was,\" he said. \"But I watched a girl break a four-by- four with her bare hands and I don't think she's an alien.\" He then proceeded to tell Hammond everything they knew about slayers and the creatures they fought including why he didn't think they were extraterrestrial, his desire to get the kids off the front line and Xander's resistance to the idea. Jack kept the conversation short and to the point. \"I'm hoping that Daniel will talk them round once he's set loose on them,\" he finished. \"Xander's right about one thing though. We can't let anyone know about the superhero kids.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We'll worry about that when we get to it,\" said Hammond. He had listened gravely, asking a few questions here and there, but ultimately accepting Jack's analysis of the situation on trust alone. \"Right now we have to worry about the NID that you have there. Mr. Freyland asked about your retirement papers yesterday. He doesn't know that the kidnapping failed.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So there's a chance we can stick this to Kinsey before he can get his hands clean,\" said Jack, visions of publicly humiliating the Vice-President- elect eliciting a grim smile.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We will have to be careful, Colonel,\" cautioned Hammond. \"Chances are we'll only be able to keep him away from your son. I expect a report once you've taken the agents into custody.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Understood, sir,\" Jack replied.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel.\" The General hung up, and Jack flipped his cell closed, looking out over the snowy back yard. He had a lot to think about.</p>\n\
    <hr>Boxes of cereal littered the countertop when Xander finally dragged himself downstairs around nine. A little disappointed that it was Special K, Cheerios, or Life for breakfast instead of sausage and waffles, he grabbed the latter and a bowl. Through the kitchen window, he saw Jack talking intently with his friends on the porch. He was tempted to go out and see what they were talking about, but it looked like the kind of conversation that would stop abruptly as soon as the door opened. Instead Xander took his cereal into the dining room, which, no surprise, held Giles, Dawn, and Courtney, the laptop, and a hell of a lot of paper. All three looked up and smiled with a brief 'good morning' when he came in but quickly returned to their work.<p>Since this was normal research behavior, Xander simply sat and ate his cereal, snagging one of the papers to see what was up. 'Third Dynasty Upper Kingdom Extends South to Khmunu,' he read the title of the article from, his eyes flickered to the top of the page, the <i>Journal of Egyptology</i>. Then the author caught his eye: Daniel Jackson. Feeling a little guilty on the man's behalf he asked, \"Does he know we're looking up his stuff?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack does,\" said Dawn glancing up, her pen retreating from the paper in front of her. \"Since they're not telling us anything . . .\" she shrugged letting the rest go unsaid. But somehow, as curious as he was, Xander felt like they were violating a trust, especially since the man they were snooping was standing on the back porch.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You know, I don't think the Third Dynasty has much to do with aliens,\" he said nodding at all the papers scattered about.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It tells us that a really good archeologist suddenly quit his job and started working for the Air Force sometime in the last eight years,\" said Dawn.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How do you know that?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"His last abstract was published in 1997 then nothing after that,\" said Courtney with a quick glance at Dawn for approval.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Abstract?\" asked Xander, unfamiliar with the term.</p>\n\
    <p>\"For scientific papers it's the summary of the paper,\" Courtney reached over and pointed at the paragraph set just under the title on the paper he held. \"For talks at conferences, there's just an abstract,\" she pulled a single sheet of paper from a stack by Dawn who winked at Xander while the younger girl bustled around like a professional. Xander smiled to himself at Courtney's newfound expertise on abstracts, schooling his features when she turned back and handed it to him. It was entitled 'Dating of Hanuptra Temple Pushes Back Age of the Great Pyramids.' He tried reading the paragraph but immediately ran into words that he didn't think Giles knew.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what's it mean?\" he asked waving the paper.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It means that the Pyramids are older than everyone thought, according to Dr. Jackson,\" said Giles succinctly, finally putting down the paper he'd been reading. Obviously he had known what a few of those words meant. \"I'm afraid that doesn't tell us much. Even in Watcher circles there isn't much known about Egypt or the Middle East before the Crusades. What we have, or I should say had, was sketchy at best in terms of history, especially following the purging by the Muslims. Mostly what survived over the years were the rituals and spell lore. Modern archeology has unearthed more than we ever had on our own given the written language barrier until the Rosetta Stone was found. I'm afraid I don't know much more about it as the Council primarily ignored Egypt since demons tend to regard the area as taboo.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Any reason why?\" asked Dawn at this new bit of information.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, no explanation has ever been found,\" said Giles. \"Some have speculated that it's because of the desert. There's also a theory that the gods protect the land, however I don't believe that. The Egyptian pantheon are rather strong as gods go but they can only work peripherally in our dimension through the rituals that have been established.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That still doesn't have much to do with aliens,\" said Xander turning back to his cereal. It was a little soggier after being ignored.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We have to start somewhere,\" Dawn shrugged. \"Hopefully it'll give me ideas for when I start running the internet searches.\" Xander didn't have an answer to that. That's how research went, you started with what you could and went from there. Finishing his cereal, Xander left them to it and went back into the kitchen. This time he chose Cheerios, mourning slightly that they were regular and not Honey Nut, but oh well, couldn't have everything. He was rummaging around in the cupboard for honey when the door opened behind him and Daniel and Teal'c came inside.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Morning Xander,\" Daniel smiled at him coming over and helping himself to a refill of coffee. Teal'c nodded but didn't say anything.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Morning. Sleep well?\" he asked over his shoulder.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Very well, thanks,\" said Daniel. \"I was wondering if we could talk later,\" he said hesitantly. \"After you get back from work or \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"About what?\" Xander finally found the honey hiding behind two jars of crunchy peanut butter. Taking the cap off of the little golden bear he squirted a generous amount over his cereal. When he looked up both Daniel and Teal'c were watching him and his cereal curiously. \"They're plain,\" he explained.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right,\" Daniel started, frowning a bit at being caught staring. \"Well, I had some questions about what you do here with the . . . vampire fighting,\" he got back to his earlier train of thought. \"Jack was probably a little premature yesterday, but I still think we can help.\" He blinked and set down his cup of coffee. \"Xander,\" he said carefully. \"I know the military isn't always what it's cracked up to be, believe me I know.\" He gave him a humorless smile. \"And I realize it doesn't help that you've had some bad experiences. But the military has a lot of good people, Jack's one of them, Sam's another. And we can help if you let us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what, you asking for a chance to convince us to quit?\" Xander asked for clarity, not quite sure what Daniel was asking for.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, not at all,\" Daniel hastened to explain. \"For the moment we just want to learn a little more about what you do here. I promise we won't try anything without your permission.\" The archeologist looked at him earnestly, sincerity in every word.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander picked up his bowl of Cheerios and shoveled a spoonful into his mouth. They better not try anything without their permission. Things would get ugly for them both if they did. As for telling them what the Council did, hadn't they already done that? Fight vampires, save the world, make everywhere a safer place. What more was there to know? Besides, full disclosure felt a little too much like baring their collective neck to the wolves.</p>\n\
    <p>On the other hand . . . Xander looked back at Daniel who still regarded him hopefully, and at Teal'c who had been worried about his and Jack's relationship. Outside, Jack and Sam were still speaking. He'd given his word it wouldn't go farther than five people; he was worried about kids fighting and getting hurt. Above all, Xander trusted him still, and his friends. The question remained, was he being foolish by doing so?</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll have to ask the Council Board members,\" he finally answered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Of course,\" agreed Daniel nodding though he didn't look to pleased by the answer.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How long will it take for a response from them?\" asked Teal'c.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shrugged and looked at the clock. \"Six of us are here. Once Willow wakes up we'll have to call England and Africa to get the other three on the line.\" The others being Faith, Robin, and Vi who rounded out the Scooby Board which was composed of Giles and the chief slayer and watcher from each headquarters, as figurative as a few of them were.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Africa?\" asked Daniel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"International remember?\" said Xander. \"Think the American military will help with that?\" he asked sarcastically. Of course, Riley's 'anti- terrorist' team worked out of South America but that was one squad in the middle of the jungle. How would they cover the world?</p>\n\
    <p>\"You probably guessed we're already intergalactic,\" said Daniel with a wry grin and a nod at Teal'c. The reply startled a grin out of Xander even as he felt the weird dislocated feeling he got from thinking about aliens. Unable to think of anything to add, he headed for the dining room with his cereal. When Daniel and Teal'c followed he turned to them.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I should warn you that they're reading all the papers you ever wrote,\" he told Daniel who only smiled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack said as much,\" he said. \"To be honest it's a little flattering.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm just warning you,\" said Xander, pushing open the door. All three gluttons for punishment looked up from their reading, glanced at each other then Daniel a little nervously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I hear you're reading up on me,\" Daniel said by way of breaking the ice as he and Teal'c sat down with Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Would be easier if you could write,\" said Dawn playfully, with a hint of a challenge.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Excuse me?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"She said you should learn how to write,\" said Courtney heavily, rolling her eyes as only a thirteen year-old could. The open dictionary was by her elbow.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, well,\" Daniel smiled self deprecatingly, \"I don't think my writing cleaned up till I started writing reports on a regular basis.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh what a wonderful idea \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Giles, no,\" Xander cut him off before he could finish the thought. \"We have so many other better things to do with our time.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, we do need to document. Think of all the lovely reference books we <i>don't</i> have,\" he held up a hand to forestall the next protest. \"And before you say it, I would never presume to ask you or anyone here to write anything. Posterity would never understand it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey!\" Xander lifted a threatening spoon.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What's 'posterity'?\" asked Courtney.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I rest my case. Do you want the job?\" Giles turned to Daniel, a playful glint in his eye. Xander could tell the senior watcher was just loving the presence of other old people.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know what it means,\" Dawn gave Giles an unamused look, slightly offended.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, and when will you have time to write reports between university and translations?\" Giles asked. \"Not to mention everything else that will invariably come up.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're right. You should hire a secretary,\" Dawn agreed readily.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You do translations?\" asked Daniel curiously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Someone has to,\" said Dawn modestly. She grinned slightly and tried not to look like she was seeing if he was impressed. No crush his ass, thought Xander, but luckily for Daniel he didn't seem to be aware of it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What do you translate?\" he asked curiously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Other languages?\" said Dawn eliciting a snort of laughter from Courtney.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I believe Daniel Jackson is asking about what languages you translate,\" said Teal'c perfectly serious, which only caused Courtney to giggle harder. The alien raised an eyebrow in her direction in apparent confusion, which made Xander sputter on his Cheerios.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you all right, Xander Harris?\" Teal'c turned to him and Xander managed to nod and swallow, a semi decent face presented to the alien before he took another bite. At that moment Teal'c added, \"If you are not careful milk will come out of your nose. It is most uncomfortable.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander lost it. Worst of all, milk did come out of his nose as he tried to keep from spewing cheerios all over the table. And did it hurt like hell! Giles and Dawn were immediately on their feet to rescue all documents in his vague vicinity while Courtney giggled uncontrollably in her chair.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Teal'c, leave him alone,\" said Daniel chuckling as well while Xander tried to learn how to breathe again. The alien quirked an eyebrow at his friend, and Xander was sure he saw the corners of his mouth twitch. Suitably recovered he darted into the kitchen for a paper towel to clean up the mess he'd made.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what languages do you translate?\" Dawn was asking Daniel when he returned.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I can't really talk about it,\" said Daniel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah, yes, the infamous military secrets,\" said Giles. \"Do they include the age of the Pyramids?\"</p>\n\
    <p>The lack of an immediate answer made Xander look up from his mess. \"No,\" said Daniel a moment too late. But the damage was done. And he knew it.</p>\n\
    <p>Giles sat back contemplatively. \"I see,\" he said softly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" asked Courtney, looking from one adult to the next. Daniel looked decidedly uncomfortable while Teal'c face had returned to its stoic mask, his gaze fixed on the China cabinet above Dawn's head.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Aliens built the Pyramids,\" said Giles. \"Am I right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"The Great Pyramids?\" Dawn squeaked. \"The ones at Giza?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Am I right, Dr. Jackson?\" Giles repeated. Daniel and Teal'c looked at each other but remained silent. \"Since you're not saying anything, I can only assume that I am correct.\" He removed his glasses, the hand that held them covering his mouth in thought. \"This is . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Look,\" said Daniel but Giles waved him to silence.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, yes, you didn't tell us anything,\" he said absently, his eyes finding Teal'c. \"And though I'm sure the threats are very interesting, we can skip them if you don't mind. Now what can you tell me about the Pyramids?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm afraid there is nothing we can say without the permission of General Hammond,\" said Teal'c.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We could give them the . . . you know,\" Courtney stuttered to a halt as both Daniel and Teal'c turned stony gazes on her. \"Or not.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Give us what?\" asked Daniel, now looking from Xander to Giles for an answer.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No one's giving anyone anything,\" Xander jumped in before more was spilled. They did not need the military knowing more than they needed to, especially if they did need to use the Very stuff later. Courtney was about to protest but Xander's glare and Dawn's gentle hand on her arm stilled the young slayer. It was into this tense silence that Jack and Sam walked into a minute later.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey! . . .\" Jack's cheerful greeting fell flat yet still managed to break the spell that had fallen over them. \"What's up?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We figured out that aliens built the Great Pyramids,\" said Dawn with equal false cheer. Xander winced at the obvious dare in her voice and waited for Jack to confirm with Daniel and Teal'c before he sighed in frustration, all traces of a good mood gone. He probably already needed an aspirin or six.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Daniel,\" Jack said tiredly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"They didn't tells us anything, though their silences were most telling,\" Giles stepped in. \"And there is nothing you can do about it now in any case.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack met his challenging stare a moment before sighing, his eyes closing briefly. \"Will you stop? Please?\" asked Jack. \"Just stop fishing for information.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Like you?\" asked Xander innocently. Because if they were going to keep snooping around he wanted to have a little more blackmail material than 'Look, aliens!'</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No. You have been hounding us about what we do ever since you found out with no guarantee beyond your word that you won't start stalking us,\" Xander looked Jack straight in the eye. \"You say it's need to know and classified. Fine. So's our info. And you already know all you need to.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why don't we both agree not to push any further right now and concentrate on the situation at hand,\" Daniel cut in trying to calm everyone down. \"Truce, all right?\" He looked from Jack to Xander who continued to stare at each other.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander couldn't tell what Jack was thinking. His face was closed off from all emotion, and watching him Xander couldn't help but wonder when everything had gotten so screwed up between them. The fragile trust that had been growing was gone, replaced by sheer uncertainty about motives and methods. Now, he realized, instead of the slow steps into each other's lives they were standing on opposite sides of the chasm after the wood had crumbled away beneath their feet.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Truce,\" said Xander hating the word that echoed from a battlefield. He looked away at the table, the papers, Giles who gravely held Daniel's eyes.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I called the base. They're sending a team to pick up the NID,\" Jack changed the subject back to their mutual problem. \"They should be here in a couple of hours.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dawn,\" said Giles softly. \"Would you go get Buffy, Willow, and Kennedy, please? We'll need to do the memory spell soon.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Without a word, the young woman rose and went upstairs. Jack and Sam joined the rest of them at the table, the Major snagging a paper as she sat. Not a word was spoken, the silence gaining pressure as the seconds went by. After what seemed like an eternity of avoiding each other, Dawn finally returned, standing nervously at the doorway, but the others weren't with her.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, could you come?\" she requested, her voice slightly strained, but she didn't need to say anymore. Willow. In a heartbeat, he was on his feet and up the stairs. Buffy and Kennedy were with her in her room, her girlfriend standing in front of her, holding her hands, while Willow looked about to bolt.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You are not going to fall,\" said Kennedy with conviction. \"You hear me? I'll be right there with you. Buffy'll be right there. If you even slip we'll be there to catch you. You can do this.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I can do this,\" Willow repeated. Despite her words, her voice was soft and high from hidden fear. \"Sure, I haven't done anything like this since Tara and it's not nice magic and I haven't used power like this for a long time and they're people and \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow,\" Buffy interrupted gently with a comforting hand on her shoulder. \"You're not going to mess up. You're strong. White Witch, remember? It's all about how you use the power. It's for the slayers' protection.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Wills,\" Xander joined in, coming in and pulling his best friend into a hug. \"You will be fine. We're right behind you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Promise?\" Tension vibrated in every fiber of her being.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Promise.\" He gave her one last squeeze before letting her go. Willow smiled a little shakily at them, hands reaching out for both Kennedy and Buffy. She took a deep, steadying breath.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay,\" she said. \"Okay.\" Another breath. \"I'm just gonna stay her a minute and get ready.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Take as long as you need,\" said Buffy with a parting squeeze. Both she and Xander looked to Kennedy who nodded back. She would stay with Willow while she meditated and got her supplies ready.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She'll be fine,\" said Buffy once the door had closed behind them, but her tone indicated that she was reassuring herself as much as Xander. He understood how she felt, a mix of fear and nervousness for their friend. Willow's uncertainty was disturbing. She hadn't been this bothered by serious magic since last August when she'd had to do a rather nasty banishing that had relied heavily on some of the darker forces. This spell should have been a piece of cake compared to that, but Xander knew that the difficult casting was complicated by the raw emotions that Willow associated with this particular type of spell. Add to that that she would be performing the spell on eight humans, and they had a very nervous witch on their hands. Xander just hoped they got through it in one piece.</p>\n\
    <hr>Jack watched Willow disappear into the basement in silence from the dining room where he and SG-1 had been banished to wait. It was a stunned silence in the wake of the argument between Daniel and Carter and Buffy and Xander over whether or not they could watch the magic spell that was about to take place. And in the wake of one floating bowl of cereal. Xander had been the one to suggest a pencil in exasperation when Carter kept pressing the point about needing proof that magic really existed. So when Willow and Kennedy had finally appeared, he'd asked his friend to do it. She had. And it was sinking in once more for Jack that magic was real.<p>And so casual. Xander had simply called out when Willow and Kennedy had finally come downstairs an hour after he and Buffy had reappeared. Giles had already left for his meeting with Courtney's relatives while Dawn and the young slayer had disappeared with Andrew into the back yard for a snowball fight. So it was just SG-1 in the dining room with Buffy. Xander had asked about floating something; Willow had raised her hand at the forgotten bowl that sat on the table. Even Carter had been speechless after that. They hadn't seen anything like it since Cassie's manipulated genetics had suddenly given her control over magnetic fields thanks to Nurtti's experiments.</p>\n\
    <p>Not alien, he had to repeat to himself. Magic. Force of willpower that Carter couldn't explain with quantum mechanics or magnets other equally obscure physics. Not alien because there was too much evidence against that.</p>\n\
    <p>When the door closed, Jack turned back to the table. His teammates were over their initial shock much as he was now. \"So she's going to wipe their memories,\" Carter turned to Buffy and Xander who had remained with them. Obviously not as comfortable with the idea as she seemed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" said Buffy shortly, still irritated from the argument. She and Xander had been antsy ever since they had come back downstairs though neither had said why. Now that Willow and Kennedy were in the basement, their nerves had only escalated. Jack watched Xander keep glancing at the door.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is something wrong?\" he asked a little irritated himself by his son's obvious worry.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No.\" Xander shot him a startled look then exchanged a quick one with Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She has done this before, right?\" asked Jack, recalling their conversation on the porch. He really hoped she wasn't doing anything experimental down there because in his experience that rarely ended well.</p>\n\
    <p>This time the young man quickly glanced away, not meeting Jack's eyes. \"Yeah,\" he said quietly. Another look at Buffy then a return to the door.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What happened?\" asked Daniel softly picking up on the undercurrents that were shifting around them.</p>\n\
    <p>\"God! Can't you people just lay off?\" Buffy snapped, abruptly getting to her feet and going into the kitchen. A moment later they heard the back door open and slam shut. A waft of cold air hit them in the dining room. All eyes turned to Xander who shifted uncomfortably at the sudden scrutiny of perplexed and worried adults.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What happened, Xander?\" asked Jack seriously. \"Did someone hurt her mind with this spell?\" His eyes briefly met Carter's. Hell, they had all been mentally raped at one point or another. If that was the case then Jack understood her reluctance to have an audience as she confronted the thing that had hurt her.</p>\n\
    <p>But Xander seemed reluctant to answer. Finally, he said, \"No, she wasn't the one hurt. But you don't mess around with magic, especially this kind of magic.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What kind is that?\" Carter pressed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The dark kind,\" said Xander, a slightly haunted look in his eye as he stared at the tabletop, obviously seeing something other than paper.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you think Willow's might get hurt by doing this spell?\" asked Daniel which only made Xander look up and snort humorlessly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The <i>spell </i>won't hurt her,\" he said. \"But I wouldn't be surprised if she can't sleep tonight.\" He gave a twisted smile that held anything but humor. \"Bad memories.\" He lapsed back into silence and refused to look at them, the conversation effectively over.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack and his teammates knew better than to push. In his mind, 'dark magic' echoed ominously. When Xander had first mentioned magic, the word had summoned images of disappearing tigers and fairies with a healthy dose of skepticism and searching for alien technology. In fact once he'd calmed down, he had even wondered if it could be used to their advantage in the fight against the Goa'uld. But given Xander's obvious discomfort with the memory spell, Jack wasn't so sure now. Worst, he couldn't even ask since Xander wasn't in a sharing mood. In fact, aside from the whole revelation Xander hadn't been in a sharing mood since they'd arrived. Given the circumstances, it was understandable Jack knew, but it also underscored the lost progress they had made.</p>\n\
    <p>Ah, who was he kidding? He and his son had barely scratched the surface of each other's lives before, and even that had crumbled everything back to the stiff silences like the one that held them right now. And deep down, Jack felt . . . betrayed was hardly justified, but disappointed didn't seem to cover it. Unsettled, Jack tried to put it from his mind, but watching his son fidget nervously and unable to do anything to ease his concerns, it was impossible. It was almost a relief when the doorbell rang.</p>\n\
    <hr>Xander jumped in surprise at the unexpected noise then frowned, wondering who could be at their door at noon two days after Christmas. Nevertheless he went to answer it.<p>Two men in suits and overcoats stood on the front steps. While not identical in dress or looks, they wore matching expressions that could have been etched from granite. \"Mr. Harris?\" the man on the right spoke first.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" said Xander cautiously. He didn't like them knowing his name \xE2\x80\x93 that was not a good sign. Quickly he scanned the street and saw their inconspicuous car parked on the street in front of the house.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm Detective Gladi and this is Detective Olus,\" the man went on. Two badges flashed quickly before Xander's eyes as his heart suddenly went into overtime at their words. Just what were detectives doing here? Now? Today? When they had eight people being held prisoner in their basement? If Xander had been a suspicious person he would have thought the two things were connected. And Xander was a suspicious person.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What do you want?\" he asked rudely keeping his body squarely in the door so they didn't get the idea that they could just walk into his house.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing to worry about,\" Olus, the one on the left smiled, the action relaxing his face and making him much less threatening, which only served to heighten Xander's suspicion. \"There was a robbery at the Home Depot you work at yesterday and we just want to ask you a few questions.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We understand that you were working yesterday. We need you to come with us to the station to look at a lineup,\" Gladi trailed off expectantly, his body turned to allow Xander to pass.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Excuse me?\" asked Xander, startled by this sudden request.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We need you to come to the station to look at the lineup,\" said Olus easily. \"We have a suspect and since you were working yesterday, we need to confirm that he was indeed there. You boss said he saw you him in your section. Please, it'll just take half an hour.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Look, now's really not a good time,\" said Xander with a frown. It had been pretty quiet at work yesterday, doubly so in the lumberyard. There had been maybe two customers that had come into his drafty section so he had spent most of the day doing inventory. And hey! Where were all the questions about yesterday? Cop shows always had the detectives explain the situation to people first. \"What was stolen?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sir, if you'd just come with us,\" said Gladi, a look of irritation sweeping across his face.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, you tell me \xE2\x80\x93 \" Xander never got a chance to finish as all of a sudden Olus sprang. The detective went for his hands first while Gladi went for his head with a cloth that was no doubt soaked in something nice and sleepy.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander jerked back and tried to get free with a shout of \"Buffy! Help!\" even as he noticed two more men materialize from around the side of the house, both with guns drawn. At his call, footsteps thundered from the dining room as Jack and his friends ran into the foyer only to stutter to a halt at the guns trained on them from the backup.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander yanked his head away from Gladi and tried to tear himself away from Olus but the latter held him fast as they dragged him down the steps. Instinct from years of fighting vampires and demons kicked in. As soon as his feet hit the next step down, Xander kicked out with all his might sending himself backwards with his full weight toppling over Olus and Gladi. Overcast sky was all Xander saw as his body jarred loose from his captor, his head cracking painfully on another head. Shots rang out, cries, shouts, then the unmistakable sounds of fighting from the yard and all of a sudden Jack and Teal'c were on him subduing Gladi and Olus while Daniel and Sam got Xander safely out of the way onto the snow covered grass. All Xander felt was the stinging sharp pain in his head as the world around him blended together before snapping back into place.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ow!\" Xander gently checked the integrity of his skull then stopped in surprise as he surveyed the scene. At his feet Jack and Teal'c were both kneeling on their respective captives who each had an arm twisted cruelly up their back. Olus wasn't moving, his eyes glazed probably from a concussion, having takenthe brunt of Xander's fall. Gladi on the other hand squirmed, though Teal'c's bulk effectively put a stop to any shifty moves that might free him.</p>\n\
    <p>Further out on the lawn the two goons who'd had the guns lay unconscious in the snow, dark colored guns and rocks on the ground around them. Buffy stood over one, toeing him with her green snowboot none the worse for wear. To the side, Andrew, Dawn, and Courtney stood similarly decked out in snowgear looking a little bewildered. Andrew hefted a snowball in one hand.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you all right?\" Jack twisted to look at him. Recognizing that he was still in mild shock, Xander nodded and expelled a deep breath.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Peachy,\" he said. \"What I always wanted for Christmas. See the world from the inside of a black van. Now you've gone and ruined it.\" Jack snorted at him but nonetheless a relived smile made it across his lips.</p>\n\
    <p>\"More rogue NID?\" asked Dawn as she, Andrew, and Courtney came over to them.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wouldn't bet against it,\" said Jack sourly as both Sam and Daniel nodded. Xander noticed another rock gripped tightly in Courtney's hand. She had the look of a stunned rabbit still but was quickly calming down. Buffy came up a few steps behind looking ready to kill someone.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jeez, what is it with these people?\" huffed Buffy, this time nudging Olus's arm when she stopped beside his prone body. \"They're like roaches or something. You kill one and there's like a million to take its place.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, Buffy? There's only four of them,\" Dawn pointed out.</p>\n\
    <p>\"They get points for broad daylight,\" the Slayer grumbled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right.\" Jack stood dragging Olus with him. \"Let's get these guys inside. Daniel, Carter, grab those two. I assume you want them in the basement?\" he asked Buffy who sighed and nodded. She wasn't happy about this, not at all.</p>\n\
    <p>While Jack and Teal'c took care of Gladi and Olus, Buffy offered Xander a hand up. \"You all right?\" she repeated Jack's earlier question.</p>\n\
    <p>He shrugged. The pain in the back of his head was settling into a dull throb, nothing exciting. \"If I were getting paid for this, I'd demand a raise,\" he told her. \"Think we can blackmail them for some cash?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy grinned. \"I wish. Come on.\" She tugged gently on his arm and led him into the house. \"Let's go see what we can beat out of this batch.\"</p>\n\
    <hr>There, finally. Sorry for the delay in getting this done. Again, I don't know how much I like this chapter but it was necessary for balance. And now that RL things have finally settled down (for real this time!) I really will try to be better about updates. After rereading this several times I realized two things. One, I have been eating way too many cheerios and two, I have been doing way too much research."

    'What a funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'
    
    'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does your watch tell you what year it is?'
    
    Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time altogether.'
    
    'Which is just the case with mine,' said the Hatter. 
    
    Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The hatter's remark seemed to her to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.

    Section 23: Prisoners Again<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>On the inside, Jack was seething. Of all the dumb, rotten luck, Crichton had to miss the SGC and pick a planet that was guarded by twenty Jaffa. This was exactly what they didn't need right now. "So guys, what's going on?" Jack poured on the sarcasm to the metal head closest to him. "Having fun subjugating the lesser peoples?" He got his feet knocked out from under him for his trouble. Following his lead, the other Jaffa cut the rest of his team down to their knees as well.</p>
    <p>"Silence, Taur'i scum!" Jack's Jaffa barked at him.</p>
    <p>"Just asking how you were doing," Jack replied defensively, quickly looking away before his mouth got him knocked unconscious.</p>
    <p>"Sir," Carter reprimanded him quietly, obviously thinking the same thing.</p>
    <p>A snarl from the left and the subsequent whine of five staff weapons being activated stopped Jack from biting out another snarky reply.</p>
    <p>"D'argo don't! That's a loaded gun in your face!" said John. The enraged Luxan snarled again but refrained from anything else. But he sure did look pissed.</p>
    <p>"Silence!" the Jaffa yelled again, and this time he got it. He glared at them coldly. "My mistress will be most pleased to see what we have caught today."</p>
    <p>"But we're harmless. Really," Jack protested even as other Jaffa began stripping them of their weapons.</p>
    <p>"And who might your mistress be?" asked Daniel. The symbol of their lady that was emblazoned onto the foreheads of the Jaffa was of two arrows crossed over a circle. Jack had never seen it before in their travels. Probably some small fish - or rather snake - trying to make a play.</p>
    <p>"Silence, scum!" the Jaffa repeated. "Bring them!" he ordered the others who none too gently carried them out by yanking Jack, his team, and the other three, to their feet. From there it was a forced march away from the gate and into the ubiquitous trees.</p>
    <p>"Let me guess, we're headed for the dungeon," Aeryn muttered from her place in line behind Jack. The Colonel just nodded.</p>
    <p>"Welcome to our life."</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Honestly, John wasn't all that surprised by their turn of bad fortune. It was them after all. Stuff like this always seemed to happen to them. What was worrying him was how bad it could get. Because it always got worse before it got better. Plus, they didn't know the first thing about the politics in this corner of Wonderland. And now they were meeting the Queen of Hearts.</p>
    <p>"Come now, John," Harvey peeked around a cartoon hedge in the side of his head. "We'll be able to catch the hedgehogs. Or it's off with our head!" he shouted, jumping out in a hideous black and red cartoon dress. Squelching the thoughts around him, John ignored Harvey and instead concentrated on not tripping over any roots.</p>
    <p>After about an hour of woods, the trees gave way to scrubland dominated by a huge black pyramid. "Holy crap!" were the only words that sprang to mind. He didn't even notice the town built around its base until they were almost upon it. In contrast to the grandeur of the pyramid, the town was shabby. Rickety houses made of wood, mud, and waddle leaned against each other like the slums of a commerce planet or third world country. But what struck him the most was the people. As they trooped by behind their captors, the people, human in appearance, stopped what they were doing and groveled on the ground. Not one head was raised.</p>
    <p>John glanced at their captors but none of them were paying attention. Jack and Teal'c ahead of him however most certainly were, and were very unhappy about it. Both of them had the hard, closed off look of people holding back intense anger. Unable to ask, John could only wonder what was going on.</p>
    <p>As they drew closer to the pyramid, the houses grew thinner, stopping about a hundred meters away from the gate. The road continued to the gate where more soldiers stood guard and scurrying townspeople carted goods in and out. All movement stopped as they passed. Muttered whispers of 'sholva' and 'tauri' dripped with contempt from the soldiers' lips as every eye except those of the bowing townspeople turned upon them.</p>
    <p>After conversing with the head soldier, their own guard led them inside through golden, columnated halls to a dusty cell that hadn't seen a mop in at least a decade.</p>
    <p>"Nice," John glanced around as the heavy cell doors slid closed behind them. D'argo just glared at him as SG-1 settled in on the floor. "What?"</p>
    <p>"I knew this was a bad idea."</p>
    <p>"Oh, don't start with the I-told-you-so's," John returned. "We knew it was a risk and that's why I didn't want you to come."</p>
    <p>"Looks like you need me now."</p>
    <p>"To what? Hold my hand? This is my second cell this week."</p>
    <p>"Needed me then too. Why didn't you take us to their planet?"</p>
    <p>"There weren't exactly road signs, D'argo."</p>
    <p>"I knew you would frell this up," the Luxan threw up his hands in disgust.</p>
    <p>"Will you two shut the frell up?!" Aeryn shouted at them.</p>
    <p>"He started it!" John and D'argo chorused, each one pointing at the other.</p>
    <p>From his seat on the floor, Jack rolled his eyes. "What are you, twelve?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"I hate being a prisoner," D'argo groused, glancing apologetically towards John. The human nodded understanding. "So where are we? And who did we piss off?"</p>
    <p>"Well, we don't know where we are in terms of space, but as long as we can get to the stargate, we can get back to Earth," said Daniel. "As for who we pissed off, that would be the Goa'uld that rules this world, though I still don't know which one. We," he waved a hand a his teammates, "are, uh . . .rather well known."</p>
    <p>"For what?" John asked flatly, cause he didn't think it was for their fried chicken.</p>
    <p>"Oh, you know, killing as many as we can," Jack blithely replied with a smile.</p>
    <p>"What does the Goa'uld look like?" asked Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"A human," Sam answered. "The Goa'uld are parasites about this big," she held her hands a foot apart. "They burrow into the neck of their human host and take over the person's mind and body, using it as their own. You can tell it's them by their voice and glowing eyes."</p>
    <p>"Take over their mind?" John felt cold. "Are they still alive?"</p>
    <p>"The host remains aware, yes," Sam answered tightly.</p>
    <p>"It's why we were jumpy about those microbe things," said Jack quietly. John couldn't blame them.</p>
    <p>"So why are the humans here?" asked D'argo. "You have spaceflight?"</p>
    <p>"We don't, the Goa'uld do," said Daniel. "Actually, the humans were probably brought through the stargate from Earth thousands of years ago as slaves. From the looks of it, they are still slaves here."</p>
    <p>"And there's only one Goa'uld thing?" said Aeryn surprised. "Couldn't they rebel?"</p>
    <p>"They believe that the Goa'uld is their god," said Teal'c. "As do the Jaffa who serve her."</p>
    <p>"How did you get out?" asked John, glancing at the snake tattoo on the man's forehead.</p>
    <p>"I long had my doubts as the true nature of Apophis, the Goa'uld whom I served. When I encountered Colonel O'Neill and Daniel Jackson I finally saw people who could end our slavery to the Goa'uld. I helped them escaped and joined the SGC in the war against the false gods."</p>
    <p>"So these things - "</p>
    <p>"Snakeheads," Jack provided.</p>
    <p>" - want to kill us?" asked Aeryn.</p>
    <p>"Pretty much. They'll be all snooty about it," said Jack. "Since this bitch looks like a low level Goa'uld, she might try to trade us for something."</p>
    <p>"Hopefully," said Daniel. Off everyone's look he added, "I don't like dying."</p>
    <p>"Nobody's dying, Daniel," said Jack with a look that defied destiny. "We've had enough of that."</p>
    <p>"You've died before?" asked Aeryn sharply. John almost missed the look she shot his way.</p>
    <p>All of SG-1 except for Teal'c looked uncomfortable. Finally, Daniel answered ruefully. "Yeah, all of us at one time or another."</p>
    <p>"Killed by these parasites?" asked D'argo.</p>
    <p>Daniel nodded. D'argo looked at John, then Aeryn, all of them sharing the same thought. "Frell."</p>

    'What a funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'
    
    'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does your watch tell you what year it is?'
    
    Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time altogether.'
    
    'Which is just the case with mine,' said the Hatter. 
    
    Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The hatter's remark seemed to her to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.

    <p>Okay, first, I got a big surprise in my inbox the other day \xE2\x80\x93 Bridges has been nominated at the Sunnydale Memorial Fanfiction Awards: Pretty cool \xE2\x80\x93 especially when I saw my little (okay, somewhat big) story nominated in three (count 'em! 3!) categories. I'd like to thank whoever it was that nominated Bridges, I am quite flattered that you think so highly of my story. If you would like to vote, I think it begins on July 22 but you should probably read the info there.</p>\n\
    <hr>Twelve Little Monkeys Hoppin' on the Bed<hr>They ended up not throwing their four new prisoners down in the basement. Jack saw Buffy take one look at the closed door and think better of it. Instead she ordered the unconscious, groggy, and struggling agents into the sitting room, sending Dawn and by extension Courtney, for rope.<p>\"Garbage ties would be better,\" Jack told her before the two girls left the room. \"They won't be able to get out of those.\" Buffy stared at him a moment before blinking.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right. Human,\" she said and then nodded to her sister approving the change as followed them out. Jack shook his head and let the comment pass. There was no time right now for processing the last two minutes. These men had to be taken care of first. And kindly questioned as to what the hell they thought they were doing trying to kidnap his son. Jack glanced back at Xander who was flapping Carter away while she tried to check him out.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's fine. No stars, no birdies, and only minimal residual anvil,\" his son was telling her. Carter had that exasperated but determined set to her jaw that said she was having none of it, a look Jack knew and hated well.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, let me check you out, or I'm calling a doctor.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm fine. I don't need a doctor,\" said Xander stubbornly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine, then we'll take you to the hospital,\" said Carter briskly. \"Daniel, could you help me get him to the car?\" Xander jumped back, wobbled a bit then refound his balance.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, just let her look at you!\" Jack snapped, finally fed up with them. \"If you're really fine there's no harm done.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm not going to the hospital,\" Xander grumbled defiantly but allowing Carter to check his visual tracking nonetheless.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack rolled his eyes at Teal'c who raised an amused eyebrow. A moment later, Dawn and Courtney came back in with several lengths of rough rope.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We don't have any garbage ties,\" she said apologetically as she held them out to him. \"They're all drawstring.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"There were twist ties, if you still want them,\" Courtney offered. \"But they're kinda short.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack resisted a cutting a remark at the thought of hooking together bits of paper covered wire to restrain trained agents. The kid was only trying to help after all. \"Rope's fine,\" he said, accepting a piece and efficiently binding his prisoner's hands and feet. He went to help Teal'c with his live one while Daniel took care of the unconscious men.</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy was back by the time they finished, carrying with her a glass of water. Her face was unnaturally chipper as she smiled at Teal'c prisoner who was the only one in any condition to talk. \"Are you okay?\" she asked while Jack and Teal'c pulled him into a chair. \"Don't be so mean!\" she looked indignantly at them, her eyes wider than normal. Jack had to restrain another snort at her obvious attempt at playing 'good cop'. From the way he was looking at her, the agent wasn't buying it either. \"You want some water?\" she asked him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No thanks,\" the agent said with sweet sarcasm.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I really think you should reconsider,\" said Buffy in the same innocent- little-girl tone.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh yeah?\" challenged the agent. Jack had enough of this.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't think we've been properly introduced,\" he said. He stepped over in front of Buffy so he was squarely facing the agent. \"Colonel Jack O'Neill, United States Air Force. The young man you just tried to abduct is my son. You,\" he pointed directly at the man's face, \"are going to one of the finest prisons in the country whether you cooperate with us or not. You tell us who you work for and who you get your orders from and we'll see about cutting a deal. So start talking.\"</p>\n\
    <p>He had the agent's complete, if insolent attention, and Jack briefly wondered if that's what he looked like to the Goa'uld. It was damn annoying, so he figured it must be close. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Buffy staring at him, her innocent act gone and replaced by irritation that he had just taken over like that. But really, she wasn't helping.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What do you think you're doing?\" she demanded of Jack, one hand dangerously settled on her hip.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Interrogating the prisoner,\" Jack shot back. \"Being nice to him is not gonna help.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine. Hold this.\" She handed him the glass of water then abruptly grabbed the agent by the front of his shirt until his face was inches away from hers. Jack made no move to stop her for the moment, wondering just what she was up to. \"I know two things,\" she said darkly. \"One, you attacked my best friend. Two, you are going to drink that water.\" As she said this, one hand let go of his shirt and twisted his jaw open. Panic flooded the agent's eyes at this startling display of strength. Surprised himself, Jack had no time to protest as her other hand took the glass from his and poured it down his throat. Some dribbled down his chin but Buffy gave him no choice but to swallow the rest with her hand clamped across his mouth and nose. When it was over she stepped back.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Now,\" she said in a normal tone of voice, quite pleased with herself. \"Tell me who you work for, who gave you your orders, who they work for, and what you were supposed to do here?\"</p>\n\
    <p>And to Jack's surprise, and the agent's for that matter, he started talking. His orders were simple and came from a man named Kielly who from the looks Buffy and Dawn exchanged was familiar to them. Their primary objective was to apprehend Xander and take him to a secure facility in the countryside. The agent kindly provided them with the location. Their secondary objective was to investigate the disappearance of the first team. He didn't know much more than that. They were just the field agents after all, following their orders like any good bad guy.</p>\n\
    <p>Once his guts were spilled, Buffy smiled, patted him on the cheek and punched him across the jaw, knocking him unconscious.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" said Daniel. \"Was that really necessary?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't like people who kidnap my friends,\" Buffy glared at him. She turned to Jack. \"So did that mean anything to you?\" she asked all business.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uhh, not really. You?\" he asked back, wondering if she'd share what she knew. Surprisingly, she did.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Kielly was the one who sent the first group,\" Buffy said glancing at her sister.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We couldn't find out who he got his orders from,\" Dawn finished. \"The rest is like what the others said.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack looked over at Daniel who stared back then after a moment shrugged and nodded as if to say, 'yes I'd tell them, but it's up to you'. Given the vast amount of information Xander's friends had uncovered already, it probably wouldn't hurt. Besides, Jack didn't think there was anything they could do about it without drawing more unwanted attention to themselves.</p>\n\
    <p>He turned back at Buffy. \"The man who's behind Kielly is Dick Kinsey,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>A second or two passed while it sunk in, only surprisingly it was Dawn who exclaimed, \"as in the next-Vice-President Kinsey?!\" while Buffy remained confused.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We have another Vice President?\" she said. \"That means we have another President too, right? Why doesn't anyone tell me these things? And how do you know?\" she turned annoyed to her sister who sighed heavily in exasperation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hello? Eighteen now. Got to vote for the first time.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did you know about this?\" Buffy turned this time to Xander who had rejoined them with Carter around the unconscious men.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You were here for her birthday,\" he said with a confused look at Jack who couldn't believe what he was hearing. How could Buffy not know it was an election year? It was impossible to ignore with all the news and ads and bumper stickers everywhere, even for him and he wasn't even on the planet most of the time.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, the election. That's the second one I've missed,\" she whined. \"That's so not fair! I've got rights to exercise here, but noooo, too late! They're gonna get out of shape and flabby and then where will I be? Stupid country,\" she grumbled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You were saying?\" Xander pointedly turned away from Buffy's sour mutterings to Jack. \"Our next Vice-President's wants to kidnap me to get to you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You've <i>met</i> him?\" asked Courtney, awestruck by the idea of meeting such a famous person.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's really not a nice guy,\" Jack told her. \"Quite a . . .butthole actually,\" he quickly caught himself.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's okay, you can say 'asshole',\" said Courtney with a patient nod. \"I'm not a kid, I've heard it before.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good to know,\" he nodded seriously, though that's exactly what she was too him. And she really shouldn't be swearing at her age. Across from him, he saw Daniel politely cover a grin with his hand. \"Anyway,\" he got back to the point. \"To cut a long story short, he doesn't like me, or us, or the fact that he can't control our project, so \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He wants to use Xander to get to you,\" Buffy finished. She still looked a little put out from before. \"You didn't vote for him, did you?\" she asked Dawn suddenly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's none of your business, but no,\" the young woman replied. \"Didn't help though since Ohio did.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You tried and that's what matters,\" said Xander consolingly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Look, forget the election,\" said Jack. \"We're stuck with him and there's really not much you can do about that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But,\" Jack cut off Buffy before she went off. \"He doesn't know the attacks have failed yet.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" This was a surprise for the kids.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We know it's Kinsey because he sent an aide to demand my retirement papers. Yesterday the aide was still asking about them. Kinsey doesn't know,\" Jack explained.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We're working with a contact in the NID about establishing a connection between Kinsey and these attacks,\" said Carter. \"If we can do that, then we have blackmail material.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Since our last blackmail is no longer any good,\" Jack muttered. And damn Kinsey for getting away with it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Will it work?\" asked Buffy. \"I mean with sleeper cells he can just keep on attacking us until he accidentally finds out something he shouldn't. I don't want to deal with the military again.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Carter looked at Jack and he read the uncertainty there. Buffy was right, as long as the rogue NID existed and Kinsey was in a position to gain from SG-1's removal, he would keep trying, and eventually he would get through. Before he could put a reassuring spin on it though, the sound of police sirens intruded into their conversation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Shit!\" Buffy spun to face the window. \"Basement now!\" she snapped gesturing frantically at the bodies on the floor. Jack made for the one in the chair only to be grabbed by the arm by Xander and pulled to the front door.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ready to play dad?\" he asked humorlessly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll be there in sec,\" said Buffy, but Xander shook his head.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I got it,\" he said. \"Just get them out of here.\" They ended up having more time than expected. Jack watched with Xander as the two police officers went to the neighbor two doors down first who must have made the call. By the time they came walking up the front steps, the NID agents and Teal'c were hiding in the basement while Daniel, Carter, Buffy, Andrew, and the kids hung back in the TV room.</p>\n\
    <p>This time the officers were legit, and Jack got the chance to play the supporting role of the family patriarch to Xander's superb storytelling. No, don't know where the shots came from. Sounded almost like New Years firecrackers going off early. They were just as startled as the neighbors had been. They quickly got the kids inside just in case. The scuffle marks in the snow? Snowball fight, sir. The car is my dad's here. The other cars belong to my aunt and uncle, do you want me to get them?</p>\n\
    <p>It didn't hurt that Courtney poked her head around the corner, the image of a curious little kid wondering why the police were at her house. Satisfied, the officers left after a few minutes. Xander slumped against the door in relief, apparently he'd been more nervous than he'd let on.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're good,\" Jack commented mildly, both impressed and disturbed by how easy it had been to get rid of them. Xander was a good liar and he didn't know how to feel about that. \"Where'd you learn that?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"From the Sunnydale police,\" Xander grinned at the irony. He straightened and started for the den. \"You wouldn't believe what they called all the supernatural stuff that went on in town.\" Jack had an idea, a certain two motherships coming to mind. Unfortunately he didn't get a chance to ask as they joined the others.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So Kinsey,\" Buffy began only to be interrupted by a cry from the kitchen hallway.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" Willow's voice snapped.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh oh,\" said Xander. \"I think she just found out about the new guys.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Sure enough, two seconds later, Willow stormed into the living room looking madder than Jack had ever seen her. Her jaw was set and her eyes narrowed as they scanned the room. \"They sent more?\" she asked, her voice a shade lower than normal.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Calm down, Willow, we already interrogated them,\" said Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Calm down? They came back. Again. I'll calm down when I'm good and ready! Nobody gets away with attacking Xander twice!\" her voice rose only slightly but its intensity doubled until she was practically hissing the words. From Xander's and his friend's reactions, this wasn't a good sign.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow, I'm all right. We took care of them,\" said Xander with his hands outstretched in a calming gesture. Behind her, Kennedy made an aborted move forward, deciding to let Xander handle her girlfriend instead.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Who sent them?\" she demanded.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We were just talking about that,\" Carter started only to get a glare from the red head.</p>\n\
    <p>\"<i>Who</i> sent them.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow,\" Xander snapped, getting in her face. \"Get a hold of yourself! You're losing it here and we can not afford that right now.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Come on, Will,\" Kennedy stepped up this time. \"Deep breath. I got you, all right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Willow visibly shook as she slowly inhaled and exhaled, her eyes closing. She allowed Kennedy to take her back into the kitchen.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What just happened?\" asked Jack looking from the kitchen hall to Xander who sighed and put his hands on his hips.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That is why we really need to stop Kinsey,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Or someone's gonna get killed,\" added Andrew quietly which earned him a scowl from both Xander and Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew,\" Dawn elbowed him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What? You know it's true,\" the young man defended himself.</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy rolled her eyes at him. \"It's the magic,\" she told Jack and the others. \"Dark magic . . . messes with her. She's normally not like this, but the spell . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>The spell that both she and Xander hadn't wanted to talk about earlier. If this was what she was like now, Jack wondered how bad it had gotten before. He looked thoughtfully at Andrew who had scooted away from Dawn, pouting.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So Kinsey,\" Buffy said pointedly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right, Kinsey,\" Jack nodded. \"Don't care for him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You already said that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, right,\" Jack frowned. They had also covered just about everything else too. \"We're working on it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's not good enough,\" said Buffy, which made Jack glare at her. What did she expect, miracles? Magic? 'Cause she was the one with the hyped up witch.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sorry, I left my wand in my other pants,\" he said sarcastically. \"There's not much more I can do here besides wish he were gone.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what are you doing exactly?\" asked Buffy. She crossed her arms in front of her impatiently.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We're \xE2\x80\x93 \" began Carter again when Dawn cleared her throat and interrupted.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, Buffy, he said the w- word,\" she said. Every eye from SG-1 turned to her in surprise.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The 'w-word'?\" asked Daniel for them. What the hell was the w-word, wondered Jack. Wand?</p>\n\
    <p>\"W-i-s-h,\" she spelled absently still staring at her sister. Buffy looked at Xander like she had suddenly gotten an idea.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you think there's a patron demon for disgruntled voters?\" she asked.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack stared at her, then looked at his teammates to make sure he wasn't the only one confused \xE2\x80\x93 or rather blind-sided \xE2\x80\x93 by this sudden question. Just <i>what</i> was a patron demon?</p>\n\
    <p>\"We could always ask,\" said Xander quietly. And that's when Jack noticed that Xander didn't look too happy about whatever it was they were talking about.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll get Willow,\" Dawn volunteered quickly, disappearing from the room.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, what's going on?\" asked Jack waving his hand to get their attention. \"And patron demon?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And why is 'wish' a four letter word?\" added Daniel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Because it has four letters. You know, more than three, less than five?\" said Xander, oh-so-helpfully.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So good to know you can count,\" said Jack starting to really get annoyed with them and all their cryptic bullshit. \"Now that we've cleared up that mystery not at all, care to fill us in?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Vengeance demon,\" said Buffy right as Dawn, Willow, and Kennedy returned. \"We're gonna see about commissioning a wish to take care of Kinsey.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, of course.\" Jack turned to Daniel, Carter, and Teal'c. \"We're commissioning a wish,\" he told them as if he knew what that meant. \"Will it cost much?\"</p>\n\
    <p>But they were ignoring him now. Instead Xander and his friends were standing in a loose circle around Willow who had arranged herself cross- legged on the floor. Exchanging nervous glances with Daniel and Carter, Jack didn't comment, figuring, given her earlier outburst, that that probably wouldn't be a good idea.</p>\n\
    <p>And then she began to chant in some language that Jack did not speak in slow measured tones. He cast an inquiring glance to Daniel who was concentrating on the words that he apparently understood. The linguist sidled up to them so their whispers wouldn't disturb the proceedings.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She's praising blood and vengeance and asking someone \xE2\x80\x93 can't quite distinguish the name \xE2\x80\x93 to speak to them,\" he said, he listened a little more and grimaced. \"That's gross.\" But he didn't elaborate. Assuming it was more of the same, Jack watched with the others. There was nothing spectacular about it, it was more like a ritual than anything magical. If this was a spell, Jack was beginning to doubt that it worked or that any spell actually would.</p>\n\
    <p>And then, before he could even finish the though a burst of flame erupted in front of Willow a figure in its midst that was not human colored. Jack blinked. This was new. Maybe not surprising after all the things they'd seen on other planets, but definitely new and there was a freaking holographic fire in the living room! That talked.</p>\n\
    <hr>\"Who dares summon me?\" a deep booming voice echoed through the room. Xander rolled his eye at all the dramatics. \"Bow before the great and powerful \xE2\x80\x93 oh, it's you,\" D'Hoffryn said in a lighter normal tone of voice, standing face to face with Buffy. Abruptly, the fires went out and the demon dressed in long robes put his hands on his hips with an annoyed expression on his face. \"You know, I really don't like you very much.\"<p>\"Good to see you too,\" said Buffy dryly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So glad we had this chat. I'll just be going now.\" But before he could do more than wave, Willow's voice snapped out.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hold it right there, mister. We're not finished with you!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Willow!\" D'Hoffryn turned with a look of genuine delight crossing his face. \"I thought it was you! A little tang of the bitter in the casting. Say, you're not going on a rampage are you? 'Cause we can do this later. I've got five to one on you cracking within the month and a little revenge served cold would turn this whole unpleasant summoning into my lucky day. I'll even give you a cut of the pot.\" His voice dropped to a pseudo whisper. \"Succulent Mihratti spawn. Very hard to come by.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Willow glared at him, her nose wrinkling in disgust. \"Eww, no,\" she said. \"Unless I start on you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ooh, aggressive,\" D'Hoffryn grinned. \"You're not by any chance accepting the job?\" When Willow glared harder, he merely grimaced. \"I though not.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But we do want to make a wish,\" Buffy jumped in.</p>\n\
    <p>That stopped the demon cold. Slowly he turned to face the Slayer. \"You?\" Disbelief was etched into every line in his body.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>D'Hoffryn glanced at Willow, obviously wondering why she wasn't taking care of it personally. \"Must not be such a pressing need if no one's been called to you,\" he said as he swept his eyes over them all. \"But I'll bite. In as much gory detail as possible please.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"There's a politician that wants to kidnap Xander. We want to stop him by wishing him out of power, or something,\" Buffy smiled.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander suddenly found himself under the D'Hoffryn's smoldering gaze for a moment before the Demon Lord slightly bowed his head to him. \"We were very sorry to hear of your loss. Anyanka is dearly missed by all.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Startled by the sudden sympathy, Xander nodded. \"Thank you,\" he said. He felt a lump rise in his throat and hastily swallowed it down before it could choke him. Out of the corner of his right eye he noticed Jack watching him but he pretended not to notice. Instead he focused on the conversation unfolding before him between Buffy and D'Hoffryn.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Now, about this wish,\" the Demon Lord was saying. \"Normally I would say, yes with copious amounts of glee, but I know you too well for old fashioned trust.\" He gave them an insincere smile. \"It's going to cost you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What do you want?\" asked Buffy, her chin rising stubbornly.</p>\n\
    <p>D'Hoffryn's teeth gleamed white. \"I want a bound contract that forbids you meddling in the vengeance business forever.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Forever, huh?\" Buffy snorted at the stipulation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Since you have an bothersome habit of not staying dead . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What's this 'bound contract' thing?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Willow cleared her throat and answered this one. \"Umm, it means that you forfeit your soul if you, you know, break the contract.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Like <i>The Little Mermaid</i>?\" Andrew squeaked. All heads swiveled to where he stood by Dawn, suddenly shifting uncertainly. \"You've all seen it, too,\" he mumbled defensively.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, delightful film,\" said D'Hoffryn. \"Only you won't just be losing your voice and no amount of kissing will save you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander tried to banish the image of D'Hoffryn singing Disney songs because that was just disturbing. \"Who would have to sign this contract?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"All of you. No meddlers allowed.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just me,\" Buffy bartered. \"No one else will be able to stop a wish on their own.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What do you take me for, a fool?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What do you mean 'meddle'? Because that's pretty vague,\" said Willow. \"We'll need a precise definition before we cast any contract.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Can I be the Party in the first part?\" asked Xander which only earned him his own set of confused looks. \"Never mind.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you sure you don't want to work for me?\" D'Hoffryn asked Willow. \"Christmas and Easter off.\" All he got was another glare. \"Darn it,\" he sighed. Buffy claimed his attention then as she started haggling with him over what constituted interference in the job of a vengeance demon. Basically he didn't want a repeat of what happened with Anya. Buffy didn't want to be limited in her response to threats on humans. It didn't take long for them to realize that this was going to take more time than they had thought so Buffy invited D'Hoffryn into the dining room with her and Willow. Xander watched them go, not feeling like listening to them squabble, remembering the last time he'd seen D'Hoffryn when he'd killed Halfrek to take back Anya's wish and remove her powers.</p>\n\
    <p>Kennedy, Dawn, Andrew, and Courtney drifted away as well, the teenager asking a million questions about why Buffy had summoned and not killed the demon. The complicated story of the grayness that was their life, thought Xander when he overheard. The bad guys are not always who they seem to be, and even the bad guys have their own rules and ambiguous morality that can be useful from time to time.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So, you know each other?\" Xander started at Jack's voice by his side, the older man having joined him now that details were being hammered out.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" he replied. A quick glance showed Jack looking surprisingly calm about the whole demon summoning.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And he's not an alien?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Demon. Well, demon lord, I suppose,\" amended Xander. \"His deal's vengeance.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Who's Anyanka?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander swallowed. \"Anya.\" He could feel Jack's surprise but refused to look at him and offer an explanation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Anya as in . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"My ex-fianc\xC3\xA9e.\" The other three looked at him sharply at this, Daniel and Sam clearly surprised and Teal'c doing the eyebrow thing that seemed to be the only way he expressed emotion. All three glanced at Jack, taking their cue from him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh.\" Jack was quiet then putting the pieces together, \"She didn't look like \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"She was human while we were together.\" Xander just decided to ignore the rest of them; he didn't care what they thought anyway. Nonetheless, his eye darted to Jack to see how he was taking it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh.\" Jack was calm as before. No judgement, no anything, and Xander wasn't sure how he felt about that. He expected something more reactive than acceptance, but the shock might still come later he knew. For the moment, Jack was an unreadable mask. \"So that was a . . . demon?\" asked Jack again. This time Xander just looked at him. Hadn't they already been over this? \"I thought you, you know, killed them.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Not just Courtney had questions then. \"D'Hoffryn doesn't really exist in our dimension. He's from somewhere I can't pronounce,\" Xander shrugged. \"He's actually not so bad for a demon if you ignore the people he kills.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Always good to have murderous friends,\" said Daniel sarcastically, a little anger mixed in with the shock on his face. Xander let out a humorless snort at how true that was.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He may be a bastard but he'll take care of Kinsey,\" he said. With both Buffy and Willow working on him, Xander had no doubt of that. \"And that's what's more important right now.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"When you say take 'care of' . . .\" Sam let the question hang.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That'll be up to us. Whatever vengeance we wish upon him. That's how it works,\" Xander explained. \"We won't kill him or anything. Willow will probably come up with something good.\" Though now that he thought about it, in her current mood she really shouldn't be deciding anything. She might choose something rash and permanent. He looked at the dining room door anxiously. Buffy wouldn't let her do anything stupid.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Wish, huh?\" Jack gave him a measured look. \"Guess we better be careful what we wish for.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander nodded. \"You have no idea,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <hr>Jack waited for Xander to elaborate sensing a story there, but his son didn't seem to want to share. Instead he patiently answered Carter's other questions about how this 'wish' thing worked. It didn't sound too bad overall as it was restricted to the creativity of the human wisher. But then again, humans could be very creative in thinking up punishments, Jack knew, especially if they didn't think they would be carried out. A messed up system after all. Why were they talking with this guy, thing, again? And how did they know him in the first place? Though Jack could probably guess given the rather interesting conversation that they had started out with. And the mention of Xander's ex-girlfriend who had died two years ago when a lot of other nasty crap seemed to have gone down.<p>Jack sighed to himself and looked behind him for an armchair to fall into. Too much information in bits and pieces had filtered in over the last few days. God, had they really arrived just yesterday morning? So much had happened.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Your planet is full of surprises, O'Neill,\" Teal'c interrupted his thoughts sitting near him on the couch. \"I never expected to see a creature appear in fire in someone's living room.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You and me both,\" Jack commented his gaze flickering back to Xander who was still speaking with Carter while Daniel listened with a reluctantly interested expression on his face.</p>\n\
    <p>\"There are no limits,\" Xander was saying. \"If the girl you cheated on says she wants your, you know,\" he stuttered embarrassed, \"to fall off, it'll fall off in the most painful way possible. Probably with boils.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shuddered at the mental image, noting that both Carter and Daniel looked away uncomfortably at the example.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is he suggesting what I think he is suggesting?\" said Teal'c with a non- expression that bordered on distaste.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think so, yeah,\" Jack nodded, shifting in his seat slightly. It was just painful to even think about. He almost missed the Jaffa warrior doing the same it was so subtle. But he did and it made Jack feel immensely better for as much as Teal'c was his unflappable friend it was still nice to know that he was flappable.</p>\n\
    <p>The ringing of a phone prevented any further discussion. It was the normal ring from the kitchen that Xander hurried out to answer leaving SG-1 on their own. They were all silent as they glanced at one another to see how everyone was taking the last ten minutes.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, that was oddly familiar,\" commented Carter. \"I think I'm less surprised than I should be.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Wait till the lack of technology settles in,\" suggested Daniel with a wry smile. \"Then it'll start to bug you.\" Carter nodded and smiled at that as did Jack, all of them knowing how true it was. The archeologist's smile however quickly faded away.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Daniel?\" Jack asked what was wrong. His friend sighed, a hand coming up to rub the back of his head.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing. I think it's just bothering me already,\" his lips twisted up as he glanced at Carter. \"It's just . . . anyone else feeling out of our league? I mean we see cultures that are simultaneously similar and different from ours, or what we know of, all the time. We face hostile . . . ss,\" he caught himself in time,\" too but they're never so . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Flamboyant?\" Jack couldn't resist.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That,\" Daniel acknowledged not rising to the bait but smiling a bit anyway. \"Or just . . . personable. When was the last time an enemy of ours offered us Christmas and Easter off just to switch sides?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"When was the last time Hammond gave us Christmas and Easter off?\" Carter asked back dryly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good point. Think we should switch sides?\" asked Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Leave the service of the SGC for a demon lord?\" Teal'c looked amused.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, if we can be patron demons of . . . intergalactic victims,\" Jack threw out there. It didn't sound half-bad actually.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I believe many of the System Lords already see us as such,\" commented Teal'c. \"An official title in addition would make us that much . . . more intimidating.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Teal'c, it's okay. No one's here to overhear you say 'cool',\" Jack patted him on the knee reassuringly. Both Daniel and Carter grinned at this as they came over to join them in the sitting area.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you think this wish will really work, sir?\" asked Carter after a moment.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shrugged. Honestly, he didn't have the first clue. He was tired of thinking of all this crap. \"Xander does,\" he said, and as he did he realized that despite the ludicrousness of everything, it was enough for now.</p>\n\
    <hr>When Xander answered the phone he half expected it to be Giles and so was surprised when another familiar voice answered his crisp 'hello.'<p>\"Xander?\" Riley Finn queried from who-knew-where.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Riley!\" said Xander delighted at hearing his friend's voice. \"You called!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Riley chuckled at the obvious.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I mean, of course you called since you're on the phone,\" Xander stopped, realizing that smoothing it over only made him sound more like an idiot. Then the present finally caught up with him and he remembered that <i>he</i> was the one who had called Riley first, or rather the long chain of flower shops that kept them in touch. \"I'm glad you called.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, I heard you were having some troubles.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Standard kidnapping that leads all the way back to the Vice President and something top secret in Colorado,\" Xander explained. \"You probably figured out we don't want certain other things known to the nosy government beyond you.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That wasn't in your message,\" said Riley clearly surprised. \"Did you find out why they wanted you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're not going to believe this,\" Xander began with a grin. He still almost didn't believe it himself. Briefly, he told Riley about Jack and what they had found out so far \xE2\x80\x93 which wasn't much beyond the next VP wanted control of the top secret project that Jack worked on. Riley listened patiently and when he was done ten minutes later, was silent for a good minute taking it all in.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I got a call from the Pentagon about an hour ago,\" he finally said. \"Someone from the Air Force was asking about the Initiative. We don't use that designation anymore.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander winced and said, \"I may have slipped when I was trying to convince them not to interfere.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's all right. Actually makes it easier for us, since we know the source for sure.\" Riley didn't sound bothered in the least. \"Since I'm the Council liaison, the Pentagon is going to reroute all inquiries to me. We won't be able to take care of the rogue NID \xE2\x80\x93 I didn't even know there were rogue cells. There was supposedly a purge a couple of years ago . . . Anyway, we'll handle the Air Force and anyone else we can get our hands on. The brass doesn't realize how important you guys are so they pretty much leave everything to me and Sam. They've got other countries to worry about.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you've heard about these NID?\" asked Xander surprised.</p>\n\
    <p>\"In black ops, you pretty much hear fairy tales about every other black ops out there. The Air Force in Colorado is one of the best kept secrets in the world. Ours might be better only because we're so small and no one cares.\" Xander smiled at the touch of both pride and jealously in Riley's voice. \"The aliens don't surprise me, though I'd bet they're not all happy and nice like the one you've met.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander nodded to himself, details flitting about in his head. The strange story of how Jack and Daniel met, the midnight summons the night he'd gotten Courtney, the absolute synchronicity of the four member team. You didn't get that close by simply working together. \"I wouldn't bet against you on that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\" There was another pause. \"So,\" Riley said. \"New dad, huh?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Xander sighed himself now.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How's that working out?\" Riley sounded hesitant.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Until the whole I-fight-vampires-slash-my best- friend's-an-alien mess, surprisingly good. I haven't managed to scare him away yet.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Riley chuckled again. \"No offence Xander, but you come across as a fuzzy puppy most of the time. I doubt you'll scare him away.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey! I resemble that remark!\" Xander mock huffed. Riley laughed this time.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Seriously, though,\" he said calming down, \"you good with it?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Xander breathed. \"But you should probably call me again tomorrow.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just let him know that a team of commandos will come after him if he tries anything. And we don't scare so easily.\"</p>\n\
    <p>This time Xander laughed. \"He'll be the armless turnip whose body you might not be able to find.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Noted,\" he heard Riley laugh again, a light relaxing sound that Xander suddenly missed in person. He'd only been around for about a year, but had been a Scooby, one that Xander had probably understood better than anyone. And they had been friends \xE2\x80\x93 still were if the death threat on his behalf was any indication.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Riley,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm glad you called.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No problem.\"</p>\n\
    <p>They chatted on for a few minutes about the Council and how everyone was doing. Xander reassured Riley that they had the Kinsey problem in hand with D'Hoffryn. Riley promised to get back with them soon about the Air Force and to give Sam a hug and a kiss from everyone.</p>\n\
    <p>By the time Xander hung up and rejoined Jack and his friends in the den, Buffy, Willow, and D'Hoffryn emerged from the dining room, all three looking pleased with themselves. Xander wondered if he should tell Buffy about Riley's call, but decided to wait, since her ex would be calling back in a few days anyway.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So we ready for a little wishfest?\" he asked everyone rubbing his hands together in anticipation. His conversation with Riley had left him in a good mood and ready to kick some ass, albeit from a thousand miles away.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Quite!\" said D'Hoffryn. \"Once Willow and I cast the paperwork, I'll send Norman right over.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Norman?\" Jack lifted his eyebrows in surprise at the name.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Patron of oppressed constituencies,\" D'Hoffryn smiled as he explained. \"We changed his name after he accepted the position.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What was it before?\" asked Jack. Xander knew he had to be as curious as he was about how bad his name must have been before if he had changed it to Norman.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Charles Guiteau. He's really quite good.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Norman still wasn't a better name, Xander shook his head at the notion. It took a moment for him to realize that Jack was looking at D'Hoffryn funny. His teammates having already picked up on it simply looked nervously between the two, Daniel's brow furrowed in thought that a second later cleared up and he too stared at the demon.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The guy who assassinated Garfield?\" Daniel asked.</p>\n\
    <p>What? thought Xander. \"Garfield? Garfield isn't dead,\" he said. In fact Garfield couldn't be dead because Sunday funnies would never be the same. A sudden rush of panic hit him as he suddenly wished he'd looked more closely at the paper last weekend.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Isn't Garfield a cat?\" asked Buffy who didn't read the comics and hadn't realized the full implication of what his assassination meant yet.</p>\n\
    <p>But now for some reason, Willow and the four adults minus Teal'c were staring at them like they were talking crazy. D'Hoffryn merely looked amused.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Please don't tell me they cancelled him,\" said Xander softly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Um, Xander, I think he meant <i>President</i> Garfield,\" said Willow slowly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We had a fat cat as president?\" said Buffy. \"Where was I when all this happened?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sleeping through history after saving the world?\" suggested Willow. \"President Garfield was a man who was elected in the late 19th century and then assassinated while in office.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh,\" Buffy looked at Xander who felt his face flush with embarrassment. He gave an apologetic shrug and shook off the feeling that he wanted a hole to swallow him right now, because so not a good thing to think on a hellmouth.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah, that was so beautiful,\" said D'Hoffryn nostalgically. \"He has done wonders since. And he just keeps getting better. You remember the election of 2000? Marvelous!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"There was an election in 2000?\" mumbled Buffy. \"Why does no one tell me these things?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're mom got sick,\" said Willow quietly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh. Right.\" A shudder of old grief brushed over Buffy in the blink of an eye before she shook it off and got down to business. \"So Norman will be here Friday,\" she said. \"And all of us in the house except them have to do the bond thing.\" She gestured toward Jack and his friends, excluding them from the circle.</p>\n\
    <p>Willow must have called out for the others mentally because a minute later the four younger Scoobies arrived. The actual bound contract spell didn't take that long to do. Both Willow and D'Hoffryn cast simultaneously and checked each other's spells. The final product was a conjured piece of paper that had to be signed by everyone along with a donation of hair. That was it. D'Hoffryn left then with a cheery goodbye in much better spirits than in which he had arrived. As if on cue, Jack's phone rang.</p>\n\
    <p>\"O'Neill,\" he answered. He listened for a moment then said, \"thank you, Sergeant,\" and hung up. \"The pickup crew from the base will be here in twenty minutes,\" he told the rest of them, which sparked another flurry of activity. Willow and Kennedy ran off to get the ingredients for the memory spell for the remaining four monkeys in the sitting room. Giles returned with Courtney's aunt and uncle at about that time and suddenly Buffy was dragging him off in one direction to talk about D'Hoffryn while Xander and Dawn tried to explain away the bodies and the magic making without coming off as completely out of control trouble magnets. Lucky for them, Giles had done a good job talking the Laysans around.</p>\n\
    <p>By the time the couple was safely in the dining room with coffee, the Air Force guys had arrived for the prisoners, all now happily unaware of anything strange in the house like invisible one-way walls. After they left it seemed like a tornado had come and gone. Xander stood in the doorway watching the van drive away and hoping that none of the neighbors had noticed too much. When silence once more held sway, he finally noticed that he wasn't alone on the stoop.</p>\n\
    <hr>\"Hey,\" said Jack. He took another step out the door, closing it behind him.<p>\"Hey.\" Xander glanced over his shoulder to look at him. \"You know, there's this thing called heat inside.\" He turned to go in, but Jack raised a hand to stop him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"In a minute.\" His words halted Xander in his tracks and the young man gave him a wary look.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What's up?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I just got a call from Hammond,\" said Jack. \"We gotta get back.\" If anything, Xander became even stiller.</p>\n\
    <p>\"When?\" he asked, the wariness replaced by something else.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We'll leave tonight.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's sudden.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Something came up.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Classified, huh?\" Xander smiled, looking away, looking anywhere in fact except at Jack. The older man didn't know if he was hurt by that or not, but some things were not meant to be shared. From the looks of things here, Xander had enough to keep himself busy without the added worry of alien attack. If only Jack could say the same now that he knew the truth.</p>\n\
    <p>Instead of replying to that, he mentioned the other thing the General had passed along. \"Hammond got an interesting phone call today,\" he began. \"Not too long ago from the Army liaison with the International Watcher's Council.\" Xander blinked, a smile blossoming across his face at the news. \"Didn't know you kept in touch with the Army,\" Jack went on. His son's reaction confirmed another secret that had been held between them. But Xander shrugged and crossed his arms across his chest.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just Riley,\" he said. \"That was the guy that called, right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Surprised, Jack nodded. \"Agent Riley Finn. No rank was given.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's Buffy's ex-boyfriend. He called earlier.\" Jack looked up sharply, again surprised. Xander grinned suddenly. \"You can add him to the list of people to avoid if you ever hurt me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"A friend then?\" For some reason that was a relief, probably because it meant that Finn could be trusted if he had managed to win Xander's trust. Jack was beginning to learn how hard that was if the last two days were anything to go by. But he must have done something right because here they were each with their biggest secrets at least partially exposed and nowhere to hide. And hey, still talking to each other.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So leaving tonight then,\" said Xander. \"You don't have any other big surprises for me, do you?\" he asked half-jokingly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you?\" Jack asked back as he shook his head 'no.' Xander responded in kind. Another heavy silence fell between them, as seemed to happen too often, neither one of them knew what to add. \"I didn't totally screw this up with you, did I?\" Jack finally asked, pleased when Xander smiled albeit a little self-consciously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We're friends, right?\" he said though the statement held more hesitation than it should have. And though it felt like a rejection in some ways, Jack smiled anyway and didn't let it show.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Friends,\" he repeated firmly. But he had nothing to add to that because he wondered if they really were friends, each of them leading a double life that only dire circumstances had forced them to admit to. All assumptions were gone now, all points of reference because how had anything either of them had said not been tainted by half-truth or outright deceit?</p>\n\
    <p>\"So,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So,\" said Jack staring at an old eye in a young and wounded face. He remembered his surprise when he had first seen Xander in person, wondering if he'd be given a chance to get to know his son. Now he wondered if he knew too much.</p>\n\
    <p>He stuck out his hand. \"Mr. Harris,\" he said formally. \"I'm Colonel Jack O'Neill, United States Air Force. I work on a top secret project in Colorado and I'm your biological father. My favorite color is blue and I don't like chicken.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander stared at him as if he'd gone mad, and Jack thought for a second that he wouldn't accept his hand. But he did.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander Harris,\" a strong, warm hand clasped Jack's. \"I'm a carpenter by trade but I work at Home Depot by day and as Chief Watcher of North America for the International Watcher's Council by night. My favorite color is sunshine yellow and I don't like pot roast or broccoli.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack smiled. \"It's nice to meet you.\"</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\

    <p>Sorry it's a day late but oh well. One quick question about S8 spoilers. Eventually Bridges will be in a position to delve into S8 and as I'm trying to keep this as close to canon as possible I would prefer to go that route. However, for those internationally, I know it will mean major spoilers. So if you feel strongly about spoilers please let me know so I can get an idea of how to incorporate S8.</p>"

    Section 24: The Almighty<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Alright," John said into the heavy silence. "I vote we escape." He had had enough of cells to last a lifetime and from what the others said, John really wasn't too keen on sticking around to see how these people treated their prisoners.</p>
    <p>"These cells are solid," Jack informed him. "You need a doohickey to open the doors on these things. Which we don't have," he added sarcastically.</p>
    <p>"Been here before?" John asked.</p>
    <p>The Colonel shrugged. "They all have the same design."</p>
    <p>"So you could get us to the front door if we got out of here?" Aeryn asked startled by this news. Jack shrugged another yes, and she and John exchanged a glance. This was a much better situation than last time.</p>
    <p>"So all in favor of escaping?" John asked at large, raising his hand followed by Aeryn and D'argo. The four members of SG-1 looked at them a little bewildered by the sudden appearance of the democratic process. "All opposed?" Their hands dropped but the others, still confused, didn't move to counter the motion. "Good. So what do we have here?"</p>
    <p>John turned to inspect he door. Behind him he could hear someone getting to their feet.</p>
    <p>"Weren't you listening to me?" asked Jack.</p>
    <p>"Yep," said John. "You said if we could get out of here you could get us out of the building."</p>
    <p>"Do you know how many Jaffa are standing between us and the front door? To many for us to get through without weapons."</p>
    <p>"We're not going to sit here and just wait for them to kill us!" snapped D'argo. And while John agreed wholeheartedly with his friend, Jack did have a point.</p>
    <p>"So what's your plan? Can we knock out the guards when they come to get us?"</p>
    <p>"No. Jaffa are much stronger than humans. We would quickly be recaptured," said Teal'c. "We must outsmart our opponents."</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, before they could come up with a better plan, the door groaned and opened. The soldiers with the forehead tattoos were back, this time led by one with a gold symbol much like Teal'c's. Judging from the way the others made way for him, the different color was a symbol of rank.</p>
    <p>Everyone got to their feet to greet the newcomers. They stood staring at each other for a minute, the contempt and loathing evident between them. "Taur'i and sholva scum!" the gold head practically growled at them.</p>
    <p>"At your service," Jack replied with a smile that lacked any humor.</p>
    <p>The Jaffa, Teal'c had called them, merely frowned. "The great and powerful Nit commands your presence."</p>
    <p>"Nit?" John asked before he could stop himself. The creature pretending to be a god was named 'Nit'? Despite the situation, John felt a grin tugging at the corners of his mouth, which only made the soldiers frown even more.</p>
    <p>"More like 'Nitwit,'" Jack quipped only to be punched in the gut by the unamused Jaffa. Sam and Daniel were beside him in a flash as John steadied him from falling to the ground. Teal'c stood between them and the Jaffa, staring him down.</p>
    <p>"Jack?"</p>
    <p>"I'm alright, Daniel," the Colonel gasped. "You know me."</p>
    <p>"You and your big mouth," Daniel said trying and failing to lighten the mood. Jack smiled in a grimace anyway as he straightened back up, a hand on his bruised middle. He nodded a thanks to John who was no longer smiling. They were in deep dren and helpless for the moment. The severity of the situation was sinking in. No Moya, no backup, no weapons. Just pissed of soldiers with silly brands on their foreheads.</p>
    <p>"Come. And be silent," the Jaffa growled again. This time they obeyed and merely followed, twenty soldiers enclosing around them. The four members of SG-1 were doing the looking and eyebrow thing, talking without speaking aloud. John only wished he could understand. He felt like they were walking into a snake pit blindfolded.</p>
    <p>A very opulent snake pit he discovered. The audience hall was easily the size of Moya's hangar. And solid gold. Light filtered in through the large windows set high in the walls and designed so that the rays illuminated the central throne and the woman sitting upon it. She lounged elegantly against the armrest clad in a gold dress that did little to hide her bronzed skin. Black hair fell straight across her shoulders. Around her feet, young women sat watching as John and the rest were led in and forced to their knees.</p>
    <p>John glared defiantly at the woman. He really hated all this kneeling.</p>
    <p>"So these are infamous Taur'i," said the woman in a deep resonant voice that did not belong to any human voice. "And the sholva Teal'c that have my brethren up in arms and anger."</p>
    <p>"And dead," said Daniel coldly and with a venom that surprised John.</p>
    <p>"Dead? Perhaps," the woman conceded with a light smile of one who is in control. "But you are now in my territory. My prisoners. I do not think such luck will hold here." In one graceful move, the woman swept to her feet, her eyes glowing in a flash of white light. "I am Nit. And you are mine."</p>
    <p>"You know Ra was this confident when we met him - ow!" Whatever Jack was going to say next was cut off by the pole jammed into his side by the soldier behind him.</p>
    <p>"I will not tolerate any more insolence," said Nit coldly. "You will be silent!" If looks could kill, Nit would have been incinerated by the one Jack sent her way. "Pathetic, Taur'i. Weak. What could you hope to do to a god?"</p>
    <p>"Since you are not a god - " Daniel received a thwack across the ribs this time.</p>
    <p>"I am the Goddess Nit!" the woman snapped, her eyes flashing dangerously. "You are nothing but an annoyance that will soon be dealt with."</p>
    <p>"So you do fear us and our influence," said Teal'c somberly yet with a hint of triumph.</p>
    <p>"No, I do not fear you!" Nit practically quivered with angry energy. "But it is my pleasure to see you die painfully."</p>
    <p>"What? Now?" John asked, startled. Frell, they didn't have a plan yet.</p>
    <p>"No, not now," Nit turned to him, calmer at the idea of killing them. "I must make an example of you. I must show my incompetent brethren how to take care of the petty Taur'i. Take them away!" She waved her hand impatiently at the soldiers who immediately yanked them to their feet. John would have bruises on his arm in the morning. "Except for that one." Nit pointed to D'argo, and John felt his blood run cold. What did she want with his friend?</p>
    <p>"D'argo," he called, but his friend merely glanced at him, his face set in the warrior's mask that had survived both war and prison. John could do little more than hope that he would survive this encounter as his guard wrenched his arm and pulled him after the others.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Reference: http:// www. philae. nu/ akhet/ NetjeruN. Html Yes there really is an Egyptian goddess named Nit. It was too good to pass up!</p>

    <p>AN: Sorrysorrysorrysorry. Peeks out and looks for flying fruit.I really meant to have this out sooner, but the chapter decided to have a cow which I had to reduce to hamburger so I could write it sanely (you do not want to see the outline for this thing \xE2\x80\x93 could have been an episode \xE2\x80\x93 and no, not rewriting it.) So it took longer than expected. The deadline for Bridges is Sept. 4 by the way. It will be done.</p>\n\
    <p>Also wanted to mention and thank whoever it was that nominated Bridges at the Crossover Awards for best unfinished. When I started this I had no idea it was going to take on a life of its own. As of last chapter this is my longest story</p>\n\
    <p>SPOILER WARNING: Stargate season 7, episode Heroes. I'm trying to keep this canon. You can probably guess where it's coming up if you want to avoid it but considering the ep, you probably all know anyway.</p>\n\
    <p>Apologizing in advance for this being unbeta'ed \xE2\x80\x93 posting first, fixing later.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Thirteen of Friday</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Friday, January 7th Xander reveled in the absolute quiet around him. For the first time in months he had the house entirely to himself. This included everything in said house, notably the TV and the remote control, access to the kitchen and all the goodies he had unearthed in the pantry that was usually under Andrew's strict watch. Almost gleefully, he settled in the best spot on the couch with his cheddar popcorn, NuttyButty's, and Cherry Coke ready for a night of channel surfing and brain rotting.</p>\n\
    <p>The last week had been long. After New Years, everyone had gone into a state of panic as they suddenly realized they were leaving for other continents. Willow and Kennedy were now somewhere in Brazil while Giles and Buffy were on their way to Europe. Courtney had gone to her new home in Missouri with her aunt and uncle, phone numbers and email addresses in hand along with a promise to pick her up for summer training. Vi and Diana had finally gotten back from their vacation to England and were presently out with Dawn and Andrew seeing a movie and no doubt getting the lowdown on the Great Christmas Caper of the US Government. Xander didn't care, just as long as they were <i>gone</i> and stayed that way for several hours. He needed time to himself to chill out, relax, and generally miss his best friends who were now a world away. But he wasn't going to think about that now. No, he was going to vegge out and watch whatever he wanted and eat all the junk food he could.</p>\n\
    <p>So it was when he had finally gotten into an episode of <i>That 70's Show</i> that the phone chose to ring. Given that it was either an international call or another attempt on hellmouth, Xander sighed to the empty house and went to answer it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hello?\"</p>\n\
    <p>It was neither. \"Xander?\" Jack's voice queried over the phone. Xander suppressed another sigh. He really didn't want to deal with this now. This was the first and probably last time he'd have the house all to himself, dammit. And they'd found out last week that despite an unspoken promise to start afresh, they really had very little to say to each other.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hi, Jack,\" he replied anyway. He couldn't just hang up like he was a telemarketer. And as long as it wasn't Xander footing the bill he could afford not to make things worse between them. He did after all like the guy, he just didn't know what to say to him anymore.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hi, how are you doing?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good, you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good.\"</p>\n\
    <p>In the uncomfortable pause that followed, Xander wondered if he should mention that everyone had left for unintelligible places. But Jack thankfully found something to say first.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How's demon fighting going?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Quiet so far,\" said Xander. \"Normal newbies on patrol but nothing major.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Any word from your flamey friend?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>It took a moment for Xander to figure out whom he meant. \"D'Hoffryn? Not him, but we did meet Norman. He came the day before yesterday. Had a few good ideas on how to keep the wish low profile.\" Xander had mostly stayed out of the conversation while Willow and Buffy worked out the details. \"He's been cursed so that the President will see him as a self-serving idiot who he'd be better off without. The President that is.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No humiliating public growth of horns or something?\" asked Jack and Xander could have sworn he sounded disappointed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"People don't like to notice stuff like that, and we certainly don't want people in certain five sided buildings tracing anything back to us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Jack agreed. Xander heard him take a breath to say something, but in the end he didn't and more silence followed. \"I hope I'm there to see Kinsey's face when the President fires him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shrugged to himself since he couldn't care less as long as the dude wasn't poking his nose where it didn't belong. Noses got broken that way after all. \"Yeah, well, I don't know when it's going to happen.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sure I'll be the first to know when it does.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander turned toward the den during the next silence, but though he couldn't see the screen he could hear the ads going on. \"So how's work?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Busy,\" was Jack's short reply. He didn't elaborate, not that Xander had really been expecting him to. He was still marginally curious about what exactly Jack did, but it was mostly because Jack had found out so much about him. On the other hand, part of him really didn't want to know. He had enough nightmares to deal with already.</p>\n\
    <p>Nevertheless, Xander just couldn't resist. \"Meet any new aliens?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" said Jack warningly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just asking.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I can't tell you that we did.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander grinned at the exasperation and obvious smile in Jack's voice. \"If they were little green women I'm gonna be jealous,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing to worry about. They weren't green,\" Jack easily shot back making Xander laugh. \"Next time I see them I'll be sure to give them your regards.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And my phone number?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"At a charge of ten bucks a number.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"If they try to kill me I'll expect a full refund,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>This time Jack laughed, an easy sound that reminded Xander of his September visit to Colorado when their secrets had been nothing more than forgotten whispers of something not quite right. This time though, the shadows were out in broad daylight. The silence that followed was not quite as strained as the preceding one, and Xander didn't mind so much his interrupted evening.</p>\n\
    <p>So exactly a week later when Jack called again in the middle of their playing Jedi Knights, Xander easily passed off his losing Apprentice to Diana who had much better chance against Andrew's Sith Lord.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hi, Jack,\" he said accepting the phone form Dawn who had answered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hi,\" said Jack letting the word out in sigh. \"How's Cleveland?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Cleveland's good,\" said Xander. \"The rest of us are doing fine too. How was your week?\"</p>\n\
    <p>There was a noticeable pause on the other end before Jack sighed again and said, \"Crap, to be honest.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What happened?\" Xander leaned against the counter in the kitchen.</p>\n\
    <p>Another pause as Jack tried to figure out what he could say. \"A good friend died a few days ago,\" he finally said.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander's heart stopped. \"It wasn't \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, my team's fine,\" Jack hastily told him. \"They're off working right now.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Do you remember Janet Frasier?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander did. The short doctor at the General's Christmas party ages ago. They hadn't really chatted, but Xander had liked her. She'd had a daughter his age too. \"Yeah,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry.\" He knew the words were inadequate but they were all he had to give.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Jack murmured.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander wanted to ask if he was okay but he knew that he wouldn't be. You were never okay when a friend had just died. But he wanted to know how it had happened. Wanted to know whether it was a disease or a demon attack \xE2\x80\x93 or alien whatever \xE2\x80\x93 as impossible as that sounded. How did one die under a mountain in Colorado?</p>\n\
    <p>\"How is her daughter doing?\" he asked instead.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay,\" Jack said, then huffed and added. \"God, I don't know.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Make sure she eats,\" Xander offered, recalling how Buffy's and Dawn's appetites had disappeared, even his to a degree, when Joyce had died. Eating felt so pointless for some reason when the person who should have been there wasn't. \"She'll probably not be hungry for a year.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know.\" The gentle words reminding Xander that this was not the first person that Jack had lost in his life.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Was it because of work?\" he asked suddenly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" Jack answered but he said no more than that. Couldn't say more than that. The knowledge was enough to make Xander glad he was leaning against the counter for support because Janet had been the doctor. Jack on the other hand was Special Ops. Images of the Initiative the night they had defeated Adam came to his mind, all the soldiers they couldn't save in their fight to get out themselves.</p>\n\
    <p>He'd never thought of Jack's job as really dangerous before even though he knew that it had to be. The difference between knowing and knowing, like the difference between patrol and an apocalypse. Both were dangerous, both could get you killed, but the odds between them were drastically different.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Things still calm out there?\" Jack finally broke the silence that had fallen between them. But Xander heard the question underneath, a little taken aback still by the concern the older man held for him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah. I don't go out since it's been quiet. Vi and Diana both have enough experience to handle whatever's out there,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just \xE2\x80\x93\" Jack cut himself off, the rest of his sentence lost. Xander waited for him to go on, unsure if he would or not. Finally, Jack did. \"Be careful.\"</p>\n\
    <p>And for some reason, Xander felt the need to make a joke lest Jack know what those two words meant at that moment. Instead he said, \"I will.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack left it at that and they turned to other lighter topics. But beneath it all was an all too familiar tension, a worry that was not easily dispelled.</p>\n\
    <hr>Over the next three weeks, Jack and Xander managed to find things to talk about during their Friday phone calls. Most of the time it was inconsequential stuff like movies or the price of strawberries in the dead of winter, establishing new boundaries that they no longer had to tiptoe around. Even after hearing about the Doc, Xander didn't push about the classified stuff for which Jack was grateful. In some ways he hated having to keep Xander in the dark \xE2\x80\x93 and he never did tell him about his own injury at the time \xE2\x80\x93 but at least it didn't put him in a compromising position.<p>For his part, Jack tried to keep his inquiries about his son's life to a minimum. So far it seemed nothing remarkable had happened in Cleveland and instead their conversations turned to Kinsey and the impending wish. After inauguration on the 20th, Jack began to doubt that anything would happen at all, but he didn't tell Xander that. He also didn't tell Xander about the phone calls Hammond had made that had Kinsey backed in a corner for the moment. There hadn't been any more attacks.</p>\n\
    <p>The moments Jack like the best though were the ones where the sarcastic, funny Xander he was coming to know better slipped to the side and let the deeply caring, passionate Xander through. It had happened only a couple of times, the first time after Jack had asked if anymore freelance carpentry jobs had come his way. One had, and Jack had listened without understanding a word for half an hour as Xander told him all about it. He'd made sure to ask the next time he called as well. The third time had taken Jack a bit by surprise when Xander had told him about Diana having trouble in school. She'd had an essay due that she'd completely forgotten about and had gone into a panic for which Xander had been totally unprepared. He was worried about how well she was coping with having more slayer responsibility now that it was down to her and Vi. Jack had listened and let Xander talk himself out, suggesting afterwards that Xander maybe start by helping her organize her time. If everything she had to do was laid out then it might help her wrap her head around it.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander had sounded relieved by the suggestion, and nothing could have made Jack prouder or happier in that moment than to be giving advice to his son. And that he'd accepted it. After Christmas, Jack hadn't known if that was ever going to happen.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack found himself looking forward to the calls that were his chance to connect with his grown child. And he was pretty sure that Xander liked them too. Just the week before he'd been the one to call, not Jack. So on Friday, February 11th, Jack was disappointed that no one was home to answer the phone. He left a brief message to let Xander know he'd called, then tried to watch TV, but failed miserably when all he could think about was where Xander was and why he had missed the phone call. It was their thing now, and in Jack's opinion not something to be shrugged off lightly. He told himself that maybe Xander was home late from whatever, but as the clock ticked past ten, eleven, midnight, Jack knew that Xander wasn't going to be calling that night. With a disappointed sigh, he went to bed.</p>\n\
    <p>He slept too. Until three in the morning when the phone that had been so stubborn in its earlier silence decided to ring noisily. His face still buried in his pillow and denial, Jack started awake, groaning when he realized he was safe in bed. If it was Hammond, he was going to kill him. Daniel, torture.</p>\n\
    <p>\"O'Neill,\" he snapped into the received that he had groped from his bedside table.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" a startled voice came over the line. Jack cursed. If this was a prank call he was going to kill the person on the other end.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Who is this?\" he demanded still more asleep than awake, though that was rapidly changing.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, Jack?\" the voice said hesitantly. It took him another moment to recognize Xander's voice.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander?\" What the hell was Xander doing calling him at three in the morning?</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're not Giles,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, I'm not Giles,\" Jack replied irritated. Correction, why was Xander calling Giles at three in the morning?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right. I'll call you later then.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, wait Xander,\" Jack said hastily. \"Is everything all right?\" Jack's brain was catching up with him now and it was curious, and a little worried. It was four am in Cleveland.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Not really,\" Xander sighed. \"Look, I really need to call Giles right now.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Anything I can help with?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Unless you know the nesting habits of random ten footed demons with really big teeth.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, no,\" Jack couldn't say he did. \"I take it you had a run in with these guys?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Diana and Dawn did.\" Xander sighed heavily. \"Dawn's in the hospital with a concussion, broken ribs, and some internal bleeding they had to take care of.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack froze at the news. \"Diana?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Missing,\" he said quietly, the one word summing up a long terrifying night. \"Jack, sorry for waking you up. I really do need to talk to Giles though. I'll talk to you when this is all over.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Bye.\" And he hung up. Jack hung up his own phone harder than necessary. Dawn hospitalized and Diana missing he thought, dropping his head back on his pillow. Xander must be going nuts with worry. And they still had those demons to fight. What if Xander got hurt, or was the next one to go missing. All Jack could think about was his missing eye. He looked at the clock again. Barely two minutes had passed during their conversation.</p>\n\
    <p>Kids. They were just kids. There were only the five of them at the house right now and they were already down to one young slayer, one incompetent Andrew, and his son. He just knew that he was going to be sitting by the phone all day, waiting for Xander to call. If he called. He'd only called the house by accident this time, maybe he wasn't going to call again until the whole mess was sorted out. And by that point, for all Jack knew, Xander could be dead.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That's it,\" he abruptly sat up and grabbed the phone. It was Saturday for crying out loud. He had the damn weekend off. Quickly he called information for an airline and booked the next flight out. No way was that the last time he was talking to his son.</p>\n\
    <hr>By ten in the morning, Xander started to feel the exhaustion creep into his veins as he listened to Giles and scribbled notes on a legal pad. He'd been running on pure adrenaline since eleven last night when the shit had hit the fan. Now he had to force himself to concentrate. The info wasn't very helpful. The Depedius Ravana, the demon that had Dawn and Diana had run into, liked cold dark place like every other demon of the face of the planet. They were relatively rare and hibernated for about two years every decade. However when active, they were known to hire themselves out to other demons, which meant that now Xander and Vi, and Andrew, had to figure out who it was working for. Terrific. Xander had no clue where to start other than the art stuff that was turning out to be a dead end as far as his foggy head was concerned.<p>\"So how do we kill this thing?\" he asked as Giles wound down.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Any way you can,\" the Watcher sighed from England. \"It has no magical defense, just its size and arms.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right,\" Xander sighed as well, a hand snagging the rough sketch Dawn had given them at the hospital. It was essentially a stick figure, oval head, two eyes, large triangular teeth, oval body, two legs, and eight arms. There was a stick person drawn beside it to give a sense of its size that was about three times too big. Looked like a giant rabid porcupine.</p>\n\
    <p>He was about to ask if Giles had any ideas on how to trap it or something when the doorbell interrupted. The noise startled Xander but after a second he told Giles to hold on, set the phone down, and went to answer it. He grabbed his axe off the side table in the foyer then went to check the peephole. \"Shit.\" He opened the door, his axe arm falling to his side and demanded, \"What the hell are you doing here?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack only smiled brightly. \"Hi, Xander. I had the weekend off, thought I'd come and visit. Can I come in?\" His eyes flickered over Xander lifting slightly when he saw the axe but not commenting.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander did not need this right now. He was tempted to shut the door in Jack's face but politeness won out over lack of sleep and he stepped back to let him through. \"What are you doing here?\" he repeated turning and leading the way back to the dining hall where Giles waited.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You sounded like you could use some support,\" was Jack's only answer from behind. \"Whoa.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander glanced at him over his shoulder when they came into the dining room, grabbing the phone before reclaiming his seat. The table was a mess of books and papers stacked on top of each other. The laptop was plugged in at the other end. \"I'm back,\" he said into the phone.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What happened?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack showed up on the doorstep. Wants to help,\" he glared pointedly at his old man for a good second. Jack only grinned again and started poking through the books and papers. \"So,\" Xander looked around for the legal pad he's been taking notes on. He'd deal with Jack in a minute. \"Any ideas on how to trap this thing?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't know,\" said Giles. \"Due to its rarity, its weaknesses aren't well documented. That and our bloody library was blown up.\" He started talking about the last time he'd heard of an encounter with a Ravana but Xander started to zone out as he watched Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>His unexpected guest had one of the demon indices in his hand now, the one that had the more common murder and mayhem variety. Usually a good place to start but this time it had come up empty. The smile was gone from Jack's face as he flipped through it. He frowned near the middle and Xander knew that he was looking at the picture of the Sarcathogen, a demon covered in oozing sores that looked like it'd been hit by Ebola. They were related to Chaos demons and apparently liked to eat boiled wombats in a diseased-brain stew, the younger the better. If they couldn't get the wombats they settled for the brains.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll ask Buffy for any ideas,\" Giles finished, snapping Xander's attention back to the phone in his hand.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay,\" he said. \"Just don't tell her how bad Dawn is.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, she should know.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, and she'll freak. She's got to get used to us managing on our own.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll tell her Dawn was hurt but will be fine.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good. Give her a broken arm or something.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll call when I know more,\" said Giles, and Xander could tell he didn't agree but would accede anyway. \"Get some sleep if you can.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander snorted at the likelihood of that idea and said his goodbyes. Jack lowered the book when he heard Xander put down the phone.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what's going on?\" asked Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander stared at him, him brain a couple of seconds behind the spoken words. Why was Jack here again? He had a vague recollection of talking to him last night but he had no idea what they'd talked about much less what he could have said that made Jack decide to get on a plane and fly to Cleveland. \"Why are you here again?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You said Dawn was in the hospital and Diana was missing,\" said Jack. \"I thought you could use some help.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You should go home, Jack,\" Xander sighed. He didn't have time for this. Art, he had to figure out what was stolen.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, I'm not going home,\" said Jack quietly yet forcefully, drawing Xander's attention back to him. \"Now, tell me what's going on so I can help.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander was too tired to argue. \"This week there's been a bunch of break ins at artsy places with some interesting coroner's reports that we thought were worth looking into. Tuesday it was the museum. A whole wing got smashed up. They're still sorting through what could be missing. Yesterday it was an art show on the East Side. Dawn and Diana were checking it out last night when they were attacked.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Why was Dawn out there?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Because she wanted to go.\" Jack gave him a look that asked if he was crazy for allowing such a thing. Given that Xander already hated himself for it, the look only served to piss him off. It wasn't like Dawn couldn't handle herself in a fight, and it wasn't like they had been expecting more than a normal B&amp;E. \"Don't say it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack sighed and rubbed a hand through his hair. \"How's she doing?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Asleep last time I checked. Andrew's with her.\" He glanced at the clock through the kitchen door. He should probably go in and see her soon. Unfortunately, he had way too much to do here.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Where's Vi?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sleeping. She got home around sunrise so I made her go to sleep.\" Vi had been out looking for any sign of Diana. She tracked the Ravana through the East Side but had lost it once it crossed the tracks.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did you get any sleep?\" Xander just looked at him. \"Right,\" Jack nodded with a humorless smile. \"So what can I do?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked at all the paper and books around him. He really didn't feel like trying to explain all this right now, not on an empty stomach. \"Donuts,\" he said looking up.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You can go get donuts. Scooby tradition at the research party.\" Xander frowned. \"Of course it's hard to have a party of one, or two I guess.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"How about I make an actual breakfast instead,\" suggested Jack. \"That way you can give me the details while I'm at it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The donuts flashed before Xander's eyes. \"But . . . but . . . donuts!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, grab some on the way to the hospital,\" said Jack as he passed behind Xander's chair into the kitchen. \"Come on.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander watched him go and start banging around looking for a frying pan and food, wondering just when he had lost control. But it was still kind of nice.</p>\n\
    <hr>Over the next hour, Jack got a crash course in how to be a Scooby starting with who Scooby was and why Jack's life was dull and unfulfilled for the lack of a big brown cartoon dog. But they had quickly moved past that to the situation at hand. Listening to Xander as he cooked was a challenge for Jack in two ways. First he was cooking in an unfamiliar kitchen which meant he to interrupt to ask where the spatulas and other things were. Secondly, Xander was beyond tired and worried and his normally disjointed way of saying things had more mixed metaphors than Jack had thought possible. But in the end he gleaned the important facts.<p>The eight-armed Ravana thing was working for something else that was after a few pieces of art. The wing that had been raided in the museum had been of African art, as had the art exhibit where Dawn had been injured. So far they didn't know what was taken, though from the looks of it, whoever was after this stuff was assembling something . . . to do something nefarious and evil no doubt. Vi had traced the Ravana to the railroad tracks on the East Side of town but then lost the trail. Xander thought it might mean the creature had gone underground at that point but they couldn't be sure until they went back there.</p>\n\
    <p>That meant that four of the five Ws were left unanswered \xE2\x80\x93 who, what, where, and when. 'Why' they didn't care about.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you want to look for what they're after or figure out how to kill the decipede?\" asked Xander carrying his plate of eggs and toast back into the dining room.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Kill the thingy-pede,\" Jack answered immediately. Art was not something he was about to touch with a ten-foot pole or a good handy archeologist to throw at it first. He had no idea where he would even begin to look for information.</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right. Here's what we know about it,\" Xander tossed him a legal pad full of barely legible handwriting and a drawing.</p>\n\
    <p>\"A giant porcupine?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Those are arms,\" Xander rubbed his face tiredly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Never mind,\" he said. He had been going to suggest that Xander get a little shut eye. He looked like hell. His hair was an unbrushed mess, his skin was pale, and his clothes rumpled. But Jack knew what was running through his head. One wounded and one missing. How often had he been in the same position? There was no way he would convince his son to sleep now.</p>\n\
    <p>Instead he turned his attention to the stick figure and the legal pad, wondering how they were going to get past eight arms and thick skin with nothing more than medieval weaponry. How the hell had they survived this long using weapons that were ten centuries out of date? The main problem was the multitude of arms; they needed a way to neutralize the arms, and he didn't think just chopping them off one at a time would work.</p>\n\
    <p>After about ten minutes of worrying at the problem, Jack started to get restless. A glance at Xander showed his son on the computer, a little dazed but nonetheless staring intently at the screen. He only looked up when Vi walked in a little while later, fully dressed in clothes that had been slept in but nonetheless looking ready to go. The young woman summoned a shaky smile for Xander, and Jack watched as he tracked her to the kitchen with a worried frown, never wavering as she grabbed food and returned.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How's it going?\" she asked in a low, subdued tone.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I talked to Giles so we know what we're up against,\" said Xander. \"Jack's working on a plan to kill it.\" Vi glanced over at Xander's nod in Jack's direction, doing a double take.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What are you doing here?\" she asked, clearly surprised by his presence.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just thought I'd visit,\" Jack replied easily.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sifting through the art stuff now,\" Xander continued. \"Something will come up once I can think.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you okay?\" Vi asked timidly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing a little sleep won't fix,\" Xander smiled. \"We need to relieve Andrew at the hospital. I don't think much will be happening before dark.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Vi nodded. \"So meeting tonight?\" she asked him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander shrugged and yawned. \"I don't know is there a meeting tonight?\" he asked her back.</p>\n\
    <p>Vi looked at Jack nervously then back at Xander who's gaze had never left her face. Jack watched the interchange interestedly. \"We'll meet at dinner time?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"When do you want that? Sunset's around six.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Before dinner,\" Vi said a little more decisively. \"At five.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Five it is,\" Xander agreed. \"You want to change before we go see Dawn?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\" Vi gave herself a once over then swallowed the rest of her toast in two bites before leaving and going back upstairs.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What was that?\" Jack asked when they were alone again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" asked Xander through another yawn.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Making her set the meeting like that?\" said Jack, a little puzzled by it since he'd thought that Xander was the one in charge.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She's the Slayer,\" was Xander's reply that really didn't answer the question. He must have seen Jack's confusion though because he went on. \"She's not always going to have someone to hold her hand. She's Chief Slayer of the Hellmouth, she's in charge. She has to know how to deal.\" He closed his eye, exhaustion getting the better of him. \"This is the first big thing she's had where Buffy or Faith haven't been around,\" he said. \"With Dawn and Diana . . .\" he stopped, and Jack plainly heard the fear in his voice. Didn't matter that Vi was the battle commander, Xander was the one who took care of them the rest of the time, and his kids were in trouble.</p>\n\
    <p>\"They'll be okay,\" Jack said quietly, words the only comfort he could give. \"Dawn's going to be fine. She's a little banged up, but she'll be just fine.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander opened his eye and huffed. \"Buffy's gonna kill me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack smiled. \"You'll get over it,\" he said. \"And we'll find Diana. She's a slayer, right? Any four-by-four that gets in her way will be pulverized.\" And that did it, a brief smile from his son that faded into another yawn. \"You need to get some sleep.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know,\" Xander acknowledged quietly. \"I'll sleep when we get to the hospital.\"</p>\n\
    <p>He ended up sleeping on the way to the hospital while Jack followed Vi who was driving the other car so they wouldn't have to make two trips later. Xander's head lolled back and his face went slack when he finally succumbed to the gentle motion of the car. Jack nudged his shoulder when they arrived. Xander started awake looking all around him before recognizing the hospital's parking garage.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander led the way inside to the elevators, hitting the button to the fourth floor where they got off and followed the signs to the ward. \"We're looking for Dawn Summers?\" Xander asked the nurse at the desk who smiled and pulled out a list to check.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Third down on the right,\" she pointed to the left hallway.</p>\n\
    <p>The door was cracked open and the only light came from a side lamp above the guest chairs where Andrew was reading a comic book. He looked up when they came in, his eyes flickering to Dawn who was asleep.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She's been out for awhile,\" he said by way of greeting. He frowned when he saw Jack. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Visiting,\" Jack told him. Xander and Vi went to stand beside Dawn to check for themselves that she was okay. There was some light bruising on her chin, but otherwise there was no visible sign of her injuries, the blanket no doubt hiding the bandages around her ribs.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What did the doctors say?\" asked Xander, turning back to Andrew.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The internal bleeding was from one of her ribs but it's stopped now. They want to keep her till tomorrow to be sure. Her concussion's not that bad though.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good.\" Xander let out a long breath of relief, locking eyes with Vi who mustered a weak smile. \"Right, ready to learn all you wanted to know about African art?\" he asked Andrew.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Does what I know from the <i>X-Men</i> count?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wish.\" Xander stepped over and began filling his friend in on what they had found out so far and what the computer had cross-referenced from the two sites.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack took the opportunity to join Vi by Dawn's side. The young woman had taken the unconscious girl's hand lightly as she watched her sleep. \"Looks like she's going to be just fine,\" he said quietly, making Vi look up in surprise. She eyed him warily for a second before dropping her head.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She shouldn't have gotten hurt,\" she said. \"I should have gone instead of her.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" said Jack gently, feeling for the guilt that laced her voice.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm the slayer, I should have been out there with Diana. Then Dawn wouldn't be here and Diana wouldn't be . . . somewhere.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Vi,\" Jack waited until he lifted his eyes to his. \"You can't change what happened,\" he said quietly. \"But you do control what happens now and you can plan for what happens ten minutes from now. If you're going to be in command you have to be in the here and now, not feeling guilty about what happened last night.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So I'm just supposed to forget that I nearly got my best friend killed?\" she demanded harshly, but still quietly so as not to disturb Dawn.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" said Jack. \"But you need to accept that Dawn is fighting this fight too, and that sometimes your people will get wounded. It sucks, you'll have nightmares about it, but unless you lock her in a room for the rest of her life, it's going to be a risk.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Vi looked away and smiled bitterly, sniffing a little though no tears fell. \"That's what Xander said,\" she told him. \"It doesn't help.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know.\" And Jack did know. Every time one of his teammates got hurt, he felt it. Every time. \"She'll be okay,\" he said again. \"And look on the bright side, you get to beat up the thing that did this to her. That always makes me feel better.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Vi grinned at that, a steel gleam of retribution in her eyes when she looked up that Jack knew well. Behind them, Andrew was gathering his things. Xander asked him to leave the comic books, which then surprisingly made Andrew stop and stare at him gravely.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Leave my comics? Where just anyone could take them?\" he asked as if Xander were asking him to leave his wallet or something equally important. \"I don't think so.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew, nothing's going to happen to them,\" said Xander in exasperation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You could sit on them! Or bend the pages. I've seen what you do to books.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah but since when have I ever hurt a comic book?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I haven't seen you not hurt one.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I haven't touched any!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So how do I know you won't hurt them?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I control your paycheck.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We don't get paid.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But when we do, I'll control it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Andrew thought about this, a man who knew he would have no choice. Grudgingly he put down the comics and ruffled through them, considering as he looked them over. Finally, he pulled one out and started to hand it to Xander, holding back when Xander's hand touched it. \"If anything happens to it . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, yeah, you know where I sleep,\" said Xander with a grin. \"I promise I'll treat it with the utmost respect it deserves.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"If \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew,\" Vi drew out the word and rolled her eyes. \"Let's go.\" With a last surly look in Xander's direction, he followed her out the door.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack looked at Xander. Xander looked at Jack and grinned, very pleased with himself. But Jack had a question. \"You don't get paid?\"</p>\n\
    <hr>\"Not yet,\" Xander told him. He checked out the comic; it was an <i>X-Men</i> part of the <i>Age of Apocalypse</i> universe. Pretty good win if he said so himself.<p>\"I should have guessed,\" said Jack in such a way that finally made Xander pay attention.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is it worth it?\" asked Jack with an impatient glance at Dawn's prone form.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander sighed. He'd thought they had gotten past all this at Christmas, but it looked like it was still bothering Jack. \"I think having the world around in the morning is pretty good compensation. Is what you do worth watching your friends die for?\" He knew he'd struck a nerve when Jack flinched and looked away.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sorry,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander found one of the armchairs and sat down. He looked at the bright cover of the comic in his hands. Fitting in way that he held an encounter in the <i>Age of Apocalypse</i> universe where Magneto was a good guy, Cyclops and Beast were bad guys and everything was on the verge of going to hell at the whim of absolute Evil. \"Sometimes I want out,\" he said quietly. \"We all do.\" He paused, thinking of the horror he's seen. \"Buffy even tried it once\" \xE2\x80\x93 twice if he counted the time she died and the awful year of her return \xE2\x80\x93 \"but she couldn't stay away. Because it was denying a part of herself.\" He looked across the room at Jack. \"Willow could have gone to college anywhere, but she stayed. And me, I guess I never tried that hard to get out. I didn't have anything else going for me for a long time, so I stayed.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Without superpowers,\" said Jack with a trace of sarcastic humor. Xander thought back to that first time when he'd simply been at the right place at the right time, and second where he knew no one else would have succeeded.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It doesn't take superpowers to save the world,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And a whole lot of luck,\" Jack added, his sense of humor definitely sneaking in there, and Xander knew, he just knew, that Jack had done it too.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Donuts don't hurt either.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack laughed. \"Is that why you wanted donuts?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Never underestimate copious amounts of sugar.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll be sure to tell the General that next time I'm ordering supplies.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"'Sir, we really need donuts, the world won't go round without them!' \" Xander said in his best Jack voice. He could just see the portly Hammond giving Jack the evil eye. And Jack of course would just grin his ass off right back. The mental image just made him laugh, his head a little lightheaded. God, he was tired and now he was getting loopy. He closed his eye, just to rest for a moment. He didn't notice when he fell asleep.</p>\n\
    <p>He didn't know what woke him an hour or two later. Outside the window blinds, the light had shifted but inside the only light was still the one that Jack was now reading by. Xander shifted and stretched muscles sore from sleeping in a chair. His neck especially felt like he had yanks a knife down the side, but he felt much better for having slept.</p>\n\
    <p>On the bed, Dawn was still resting. He got up to check on her. She was still pale and asleep she looked like the little girl he had babysat for all those years. When had she gone and grown up, he wondered, though he knew it was around the same time he had. She looked young, but she wasn't. But she was. And she was hurt. He felt like he had let her down in some way though realistically he knew they had no way of knowing.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did you ever believe in happy endings?\" he asked suddenly of Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes. I still do.\" Xander turned to look at him questioningly. Jack let loose a small smile at his confusion. \"Pessimism is habit forming.\" He paused then added. \"Optimism is too, I think.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander cracked a grin at that. \"The new drug, optimism. Twenty bucks a pop.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"More like life,\" said Jack, a serious note back in his tone. \"Did you know Charlie used to read the <i>X-Men</i>?\" Wondering where that had come from, Xander waited for him to finish. \"I almost didn't get a chance to remember that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"A mission?\" he asked, remembering the lost friend in January, imagining the others he must have lost in his long military career that was so black it could have been a gravity well for information.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Habit forming pessimism.\" Jack looked back at the comic in his hand. \"Daniel gave me a happy ending. Maybe not what I would have wanted but . . . maybe there's only happier endings.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is that why you came?\" asked Xander. \"Here. To make sure.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shrugged. \"I was half asleep and scared that that was the last time we'd talk. I may not like you throwing yourself into danger all the time but \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"\xE2\x80\x93 that'd be sticking a 'pot' post-it on your forehead,\" Xander finished.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Something like that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander nodded. As they looked at each other across Dawn's hospital room, he felt more than words pass between them. Xander didn't need to ask if he'd ever get used to the fear of losing a loved one or a girl in his care. He didn't need to ask if it was always lonely at the top or whether fighting was worth giving up normal. He didn't need to hear that time healed wounds but until he let them go the guilt would burn as fresh as the day it happened. He knew his answers and had long since made peace with himself and the ghosts of his life. He didn't need Jack to tell him these things but they were said anyway in that one look between them. And for once it was about <i>him</i>, and the feeling felt like a bucket of warm water being poured over his head as he hadn't felt since Anya had last smiled at him, for him.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack had come for him.</p>\n\
    <hr>Jack was beginning to regret having come. But that probably had more to do with the huge frickin' demon in front of him that looked absolutely nothing like a giant porcupine. For one it was an awful putrid yellow-green with no hair and really big teeth. Not to mention eight arms that were absolutely everywhere.<p>They had received a frantic call from Andrew and Vi that they had figured out that the ceremony thing to call forth some head honcho war demon was going to start at sunset of the night of the new moon, which of course was tonight, and been told in no uncertain terms to get their asses to the warehouses by the tracks. Well, Xander had, but since he didn't drive if he could avoid it, and since Jack had rather forcefully told him he was coming too, Jack had come along. And in the car, he had gotten the twenty-minute crash course in medieval weaponry.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm giving you a crossbow and the axe. Careful of it getting stuck in any bones, especially skulls,\" Xander had told him when they'd pulled up next to Andrew who was waiting for them. Vi had already gone ahead to scout out the building. \"And I want you to stay back as long as you can. You're the diversion if we get into trouble.\" Andrew had nodded as he loaded his own crossbow so Jack assumed he'd be staying back as well.</p>\n\
    <p>And now here the two of them were behind a stack of empty crates shooting bolts at the giant centipede in an effort to distract it from Vi's sword and Xander's double headed axe that darted in from behind whenever he had a clear shot. Jack tried to ignore his son before he could think about him getting stepped on and instead focused on hitting hands and shoulders. But he couldn't ignore Vi front and center as she ducked and dodged, stabbed and sliced, flipped and kicked, bounced off walls and got back up. She was pure determination, fury, and strength, and she kept the demon screaming and howling until it was so full of bolts and gashes that it could no longer stand up.</p>\n\
    <p>As soon as it had crashed to its knees, Vi was on it, brushing away its last attempts at resistance before ripping her sword up its middle. Oozing yellowish blood flowed out with its life. \"I am not cleaning that up,\" muttered Andrew from beside him as they rushed after Vi and Xander who had already run through the door that was no longer guarded.</p>\n\
    <p>The sounds of battle already echoed from the other room, centered around one corner where something small was cornered amongst ten or so human sized demons that had gray pebbly skin, clawed fingers, and wore the same Wal-Mart brand as everyone else. A knot of demons in the center of the room who were obviously waiting for the corner situation to be resolved, jumped at their sudden entrance. Jack had no more time to think before one of them was rushing at him with his claws out, only noticing that he too had unhealthily big teeth before striking out with his borrowed axe. Xander was right about it sticking.</p>\n\
    <p>Around him were shouts from the others, but Jack only saw the snarling faces before him, up close and personal, and all of them wanting him dead. He knew that Andrew was beside him, the Vi had gone off after the person in the corner and the Xander was making for the big shots at the center and very firmly keeping Jack on his left side. The old soldier made sure he stayed there, all the way to the smashing of the funny carvings set up in a triangular formation in the middle of a complex drawing. And then it was over. The demons scattered. The dead were left lying.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Diana!\" shouted Xander. And there she was, limping slightly beside Vi as the two slayers joined them. Her hair was tangled and her clothes torn and there was a huge chain and a piece of wall attached to her wrists, but to Jack she seemed to glow with energy of a little kid that had had too much candy. It was like watching Vi fight the Ravana though the older girl had a quieter intensity to her. Watching them as they surveyed the scene with pride, Jack was reminded of the power he'd seen in Buffy's eyes at Christmas, a mere shimmer of what combat brought out. And he thought that he finally understood what Xander had meant about slayers. Forces of nature disguised as girls.</p>\n\
    <p>Arms burning now that the adrenaline was wearing off, and his knee telling him that he was getting way to old for this shit, Jack just wanted to go to sleep.</p>\n\
    <hr>Sunday hosted a late breakfast at the house, filled with jokes and tales. Diana had indeed been captured by the Ravana and taken to its bosses, the still unresearched and unknown but fondly renamed Rock Heads, who were going to use her as the human blood ingredient. The giant porcupine hadn't realized that to people smaller than itself, this one girl that offered resistance probably hadn't been the best choice for the job. Considering that it was dead now, Jack couldn't help but point out the understatement of the year.<p>Diana had been knocked out during the fight and had regained consciousness once before being knocked out again. When she woke again just before the ceremony, she had taken part of the wall with her.</p>\n\
    <p>Dawn had screamed in surprise when she showed up in her room looking none the worse for wear. The two girls hadn't stopped talking as they first checked Dawn out from the hospital then drove home. No one really minded.</p>\n\
    <p>Dinner was another riotous affair of people who had faced death and were happy to have come out the other side. Jack joked with them but couldn't help feeling sad and a little old. He wondered if Giles ever felt this out of place at a table of kids. He felt Xander's gaze on him more than once.</p>\n\
    <p>After dinner, he went upstairs to pack the bag he hadn't really unpacked. He was back in the bare room he'd stayed in over Thanksgiving, which seemed so long ago now, a lifetime. When Xander and the girls had done exactly the same thing.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think Andrew got most of the blood out, but it's gray so you can say it's an ink stain or something if anyone asks.\" Xander stood in the doorway with Jack's clothes that he'd worn the night before. They had been hastily folded, and Jack accepted them with a thanks. Xander watched as he put them in his bag. \"I'm glad you came,\" he said abruptly, making Jack stop and look up. His son looked vaguely embarrassed at admitting it but then he grinned. \"You need a little work on the rapid reload of your crossbow, but you're a mean shot.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thanks. It was only my first battle of the twelfth century,\" Jack smiled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We could have gone caveman against vampires,\" Xander shrugged.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Caveman?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Stakes. Little bits of wood through the heart. About as low-tech as you get.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack thought he could stand a little more low-tech in his life and a little less of the advanced alien doohickeys. They did come in handy, he had to admit, but what Jack wouldn't give to be able to smash an axe through Anubis's nonexistent head.</p>\n\
    <p>Joking aside, he was just glad that Friday night's phone call had had a happy ending to it. A happier ending. And that's what was bothering him. One girl and a little help had taken out a creature that Jack wouldn't have contemplated going up against without at least a grenade and a couple of bars of C4. And she had done it with a sword.</p>\n\
    <p>Perhaps most disturbing was that this was not a one-time deal. It was everyday and Xander was right in the thick of it, probably summing up injuries and a missing person as having a bad week. But Xander hadn't tried to hide it from him this time. He almost wished he had.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" asked Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just wondering how I'm ever going to sleep again from worrying about you,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're going to worry?\" Xander seemed slightly surprised. Jack could only lift his eyebrows.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Of course, I'm going to worry about you!\" he snapped. \"You're out there fighting giant . . . green things! And I'm not always going to be there. And stop looking surprised,\" he added suddenly irritated. What? Did Xander think he'd come all the way out here on a weekend off just because the mood struck him?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sorry,\" said Xander not sounding sorry at all. \"You're being all parenty.\" He smiled and flicked a hand to explain. \"Not used to it coming from anyone other than Giles.\"</p>\n\
    <p>That stopped Jack for a second \xE2\x80\x93 no one other than Giles, he thought angrily. \"Well, you better get used to it,\" he said, leveling a gaze at his son that spoke of 'elses' better not voiced aloud.</p>\n\
    <p>And Xander said, \"Okay.\"</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <hr>Hope that satisfies. Oh, and for all those who keep asking, here's a challenge for everyone: I challenge someone to write a short companion piece from General Hammond's point of view of all the conversations he has with Jack, or should have had at any point in the story. Must be in character and preferably humorous (just remember life is funny, even at its worst). Let me know if you write it so I can read it."

    <hr>SPOILER WARNING: Heavy spoilers for season 7 episode Lost City. This chapter is written around that episode. I'm not going to rewrite it so a little familiarity is expected. I'll give you all you need to know for the chapter to make sense. Also, I have decided not to incorporate season 8, so that season in spoiler-free.<p>If you are avoiding Season 7 spoilers as I know some of you are let me know and I'll send you a spoiler free summary of chapter 14. I plan on keeping Chs 15 and 16 spoiler free.</p>\n\
    <hr>Fourteen Gazillion To Go<hr>Jack didn't know what was worse, knowing the kind of things Xander fought or letting his imagination fill in the blanks. It had been two months since he'd fought his first demon and it seemed like his calls to Xander kept getting more and more irregular. Granted, part of that was his mission schedule but Xander's was just as erratic.<p>They'd come to a sort of agreement about what they talked about. If Jack wanted to know what was going on, he asked point blank and Xander would usually answer with watered down answers. \"Just a snake thing that took longer to track down than we thought,\" or \"Some kids at the high school getting in over their heads with the magic.\" Jack tried not to be too pushy about it, but when Xander sounded exhausted or down he always asked.</p>\n\
    <p>For his part, Xander asked even fewer questions but that seemed more because he was tired of the endless lack of details that Jack could provide. But somehow he always knew when Jack got hurt or when he was worried about a wounded teammate. Jack had asked after the third time how he knew, wondering if it was more magic, but Xander instead told him simply that he called later. Jack remembered feeling slightly uncomfortable when he'd heard that and thinking that his son was too perceptive for his own good. Or rather Jack's.</p>\n\
    <p>That was why he was staring at the phone right now instead of picking it up and dialing. Xander would <i>know</i> that this wasn't a normal call. Jack's mind flickered over the last few days. The mission to extract the Ancient's library device, Anubis's attack, and now, way too much knowledge in his head that could kill him in a matter of days.</p>\n\
    <p>Last night when his team had been over, Daniel had asked him what he was going to tell Xander. Jack had replied, \"That I was saving the world.\" The truth was he didn't know what he was going to say. The problem was he also couldn't not call. Taking a deep breath, he reached for the phone. Maybe he'd get lucky and Xander would be at work.</p>\n\
    <p>The phone rang once, twice, three times. When it got to five, Jack was ready to let out a sigh of relief \xE2\x80\x93 that was quickly dashed when a breathless \"Hello?\" answered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Vi, it's Jack,\" he said pleasantly, recognizing the teenager's voice. With an ease that comes from years of practice, he staunchly ignored the feeling of dread that clung in his stomach.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Jack!\" she cheerfully replied. \"How you doing? Xander's upstairs, just a sec. XANDER!\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack smiled at the quick transfer figuring he had interrupted something or other. Usually he would at least have a chance to answer questions and ask how things were going before Xander was shouted for.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Jack,\" his son's light tone greeted him all too quickly. \"You're calling early for once.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack nodded and said, \"Yeah, thought I'd change things up.\" It was two in the afternoon on a Sunday. So much for the at-work plan.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh-huh,\" said Xander. Crap, thought Jack. \"So what's up?\" Double crap, Jack amended. He should have asked that first.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, you know, same old, same old,\" said Jack evasively. \"How are you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"In need of a new job.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What's wrong?\" Jack asked suddenly concerned.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The one I have is boring me to tears,\" said Xander. \"I've had some crappy jobs before but I usually managed to get fired before I got too bored with them. Here, my boss actually likes me and says I do good work and doesn't mind my switching shifts at the last minute.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And that's bad?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"For my other job, no. But I feel like I'm going to go insane if I have to keep this up. I hate retail.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah, the joys of knowing that the customer is always right,\" said Jack sagely.</p>\n\
    <p>\"'Right' is a relative term,\" said Xander with a sigh.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Jack agreed. In more than just the retail sense, he thought. If he . . . he would miss this, the idle chatter about life, knowing how he was doing, what was good, what was bad. Jack closed his eyes. \"Have I told you how proud I am of you?\" he half whispered. He heard Xander's breath catch on the other end of the line.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack?\" Xander's voice was breathy and uncertain. \"What's wrong?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack felt like an idiot now for even saying it. He was a man of action, not words, and his only relief was that Xander wasn't there to see him shifting uncomfortably in his seat. \"Nothing really \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack,\" Xander cut him off harshly. \"You don't start a 'goodbye' speech when nothing's wrong.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, you started a 'goodbye' speech! 'I'm proud of you, I love you.' If every thing is just puppies and rainbows you <i>don't</i> say that!\" Xander snapped. \"Now what's wrong?!\" A little taken aback by the vehemence in his son's voice, Jack was shocked into silence for minute. \"Jack!\" Xander prompted.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I, uh,\" Jack struggled for a way to explain that wouldn't be breaking a zillion laws. \"I kinda did something stupid,\" he finally said. \"But given the situation, there wasn't really a choice.\" He paused and Xander remained silent, waiting. \"I can't go into detail, and it's not hopeless, just . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dire?\" Xander finished for him. Jack winced.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I might die,\" he quipped quietly. Dead silence. Jack wondered for a moment if Xander was still there.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That bad?\" Xander finally said, his voice tight even as he tried to keep it light. \"Is this a scheduled death or are you just ad libbing?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"If it happens, and I stress the 'if,'\" Jack hesitated, remembering the last time he'd spouted alien words and felt himself lose his mind, \"sometime next week.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Got it all planned out, huh? Decided life was too boring under your mountain, and hey, let's give death a try. Next Thursday good for you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack winced at the raw sarcasm. \"It's not like that,\" he said a little exasperatedly. \"If you must know it's probably going to save the world.\" Maybe Xander would understand in terms he seemed to be familiar with.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Great,\" said Xander bitingly. \"I'll have to let the others know that Apocalypse Season has opened early this year. Good to know I rate at least a phone call.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\n\
    <p>But Jack didn't have anything to say. He felt empty, like a tin can that someone was still trying to hammer the last of the beans out of. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. Sorry for . . . everything. God, he hadn't felt this bad about anything in years.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Don't be sorry,\" said Xander, his voice softer than it was before but no less hurt. \"Just make sure you don't die. Or I swear to whatever gods there are that I will have Willow resurrect you so I can kill you myself.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack couldn't help but smile at the threat. \"Guess I better not die then.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No.\" Xander sighed. \"Look, call me when you're not going to die any more.\"</p>\n\
    <p>He was going to hang up. \"Xander,\" said Jack quickly, not wanting his last chance to slip away.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" his son interrupted. \"<i>Call me </i>when you're not going to die.\" And he was gone. Jack held the phone a moment longer, staring at it blankly before replacing it in the cradle. Unsaid. Too much had been left unsaid. His head fell into weary palms. Xander sure wasn't letting him off easy. There had been no 'ifs' in his demand. Jack was just going to have to make sure he was alive to tell him.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Xander stared at the phone he had slammed down. Bastard. That stupid, damn . . . bastard. Unconsciously he clenched his jaw, so angry that he couldn't do more than glare holes in the phone and hope they burned Jack. He was going to kill him. And he wasn't going to die, oh no, Jack was going to stay nice and healthy until Xander could get his hands on him, then he would show him what dying was all about. If \xE2\x80\x93 but Xander squelched the thought before it had even formed. Jack was going to call him in a week, and Xander was going to scream at him for being an idiot. Three rules of slaying: if it's bad, run; always make plans for the day after; and don't die! And then of course there was always the addendum rule that was true beyond slaying that girls were always right. At least one of them. But not the point here.</p>\n\
    <p>No, the point here was simple. Jack was an idiot. And a bastard. And Xander would never forgive him if he died.</p>\n\
    <p>Suddenly feeling the urge to hit something, he slammed down to the basement, made a beeline for the punching bag, and started beating the hell out of it. His thoughts gave way to mindlessness and the burning anger that he refused to let go of. He didn't know how long he was down there but he was sweaty and pleasantly tired when he finally stopped, leaning forward to rest his head against the bag.</p>\n\
    <p>Dawn was sitting on the bottom stairs when he finally turned around. Large eyes watching out of a considering face, but she didn't say anything, just followed his progress as he came and sat beside her. They sat in silence for a minute before Dawn broke it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack?\" she asked. Xander nodded. \"What happened?\"</p>\n\
    <p>He didn't look at her. \"Said he did something that could kill him to save the world.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Neither one of them said anymore. They didn't move until Andrew came and asked what they wanted for dinner. And that evening, they all went on patrol.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>The next three days were tense. After Jack's phone call, Xander was paranoid about everything going to hell \xE2\x80\x93 literally. He was also snappish and bad tempered with everyone, which didn't help, matters much, even if they knew why. Sort of. As Xander kept ranting, Jack hadn't given them any useful information about what was potentially going down so they didn't know what they were looking for in the first place.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander had alerted Giles and the others, and the scattered research department had gone to work combing for any kind of a clue, but nothing came up. Jack still hadn't called.</p>\n\
    <p>It was on Tuesday when they finally figured it out. Xander was at work checking stock in the back with the radio on for company when the commercial break suddenly turned into a news report. \"We have a special weather report from the National Weather Station. An unexpected meteor shower is in progress across much of the Western Hemisphere. People are advised to stay indoors as there have already been reports of meteors striking the surface in Texas and Bolivia. Scientists say that it should pass within the hour.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The report brought Xander up short and he stared at the radio for a second before bolting for the door. Unexpected meteor shower, his ass. Those things were tracked, predicted. He should know since Dawn and Andrew dragged them all outside to watch the shooting stars when they came. And if they were already hitting the Earth? No way was it natural.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander made it to the staff room at the other end of the building in under two minutes. It took him another thirty seconds to find his cell phone and call Andrew.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hello?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew, turn on the news. I think we have our world ending event,\" he said quickly. \"Call Giles and let him know.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Meteors?\" said Andrew and Xander could hear the TV on in the background. \"Xander, I don't think there's much we can do against meteors.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We can stop whatever's causing them,\" Xander said, though he had no idea how they would do that. \"Look, call Giles, see what he says and call me back.\" He glanced quickly at his watch. It was a little after two. His shift didn't end till four and the girls wouldn't get home from school until around three thirty. Xander wondered if they had that long. \"How are the wards on the hellmouth?\" he asked waiting a minute as Andrew went and checked the crystal.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No change,\" he reported. \"I'll call if it does.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right, thanks. See you later.\" He hit 'end' and sighed. There really wasn't much he could do now until he heard back from Giles and Andrew. He might as well get paid for the next two hours.</p>\n\
    <p>But even as he went back to the stock room and started counting nuts and bolts again, Xander couldn't help but worry about what was going on and feel a frustrating sense of helplessness about it. And wonder what Jack was doing at that very moment. It sucked. He couldn't concentrate and ended up recounting the packs of nails four times. He'd been at it an hour or so, his mind wandering from nails to nasty creatures crawling out of meteors when the question of what was going on suddenly became a lot less academic.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander <i>felt </i>it. Suddenly, in every fiber of his being he felt a tug that grew ever more insistent, building and building through his bones and muscles like liquid fire until suddenly a part of him was ripped away like duct tape being ripped off of skin. It was so hard and fast that the force of it knocked him to his knees, his whole body burning for an instant before slowly melting away in a throbbing pulse. Xander gasped for breath, wondering what the hell had just happened and at the same time, afraid of the answer. Nothing in his life had ever felt like that, nothing, and Xander had undergone some wacky spells in his time.</p>\n\
    <p>It took him a few minutes to stand, a wash of dizziness forcing him to pause with his head between his knees to prevent his lunch from ending up on the floor. When he finally did manage to get to his feet and stay on them his head had cleared considerably and the burning sensation was all but gone, leaving him with a killer headache and something else that niggled in the back of his head. It wasn't until he stepped out of the stock room and saw the rest of the store acting as if nothing had happened that Xander, now more confused than ever, realized that everything felt just a bit off. 'Everything' as in the artificial light, the sounds of people talking, the way his feet felt against the ground \xE2\x80\x93 and at the same time everything was just as it always had been. Exactly alike except for that feeling.</p>\n\
    <p>He quickly fished his cell out of his pocket and hit the speed dial for home. It took three rings for Andrew to answer and when he did, Xander knew that he had felt whatever it was too.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>In fact, one frantic phone call from the high school, one from Giles, one from Buffy, and a panicked call from Kennedy confirmed that anyone that had anything to do with the supernatural had felt it. And in varying degrees. In Brazil, Willow was still unconscious. Of the Cleveland crowd, Dawn had been hit the hardest, but even she had woken up after a few hours. Vi and Diana and the other slayers had taken it hard as well but with a much faster recovery time, though it had been longer than Xander's and Andrew's. And everyone felt the same shift in perception that couldn't be described as more than a feeling of something off, almost like when ears wouldn't pop when they needed to, only not quite as concrete a feeling.</p>\n\
    <p>And that wasn't even the bad news. No, what currently had the five continent conference call's attention was the fact that the slayers' powers were greatly diminished. Buffy had noticed it first since she had been on the prowl in Europe at the time. One minute she'd been fighting a vamp, the next she'd been fighting for her life.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I haven't been able to contact the Bath coven,\" Giles was saying. \"I believe, given Willow's reaction, that they were hit hard as well.\" Xander glanced around the dining room table. Andrew was clearly scared and nervous and trying to hide it. Dawn, pale and still in pain sat huddled in a blanket beside him. Diana refused to look up from the tabletop while Vi met Xander's gaze with a frightened yet determined one of her own. \"The force seems to be proportional to the amount of magic used by the individual. What ever it was, it ripped away innate power.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So how do we stop it?\" demanded Kennedy anxiously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's already over,\" said Giles. \"Until we know what caused it, I don't think there's much we can do except wait and see.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Any ideas?\" asked Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The meteor shower,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, quite,\" Giles sighed. \"Hardly coincidental that it stopped after the event.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We need to contact all our slayers and let them know what's going on,\" said Faith.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Giles?\" said Dawn suddenly, \"if something ripped all the magical energy from everyone around the world, where did it all go?\"</p>\n\
    <p>There was a brief silence. \"I don't suppose there's energy heaven,\" suggested Buffy quietly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" said Giles.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So we need to find out what that meteor shower was, why it stopped, and where all our magical energy went,\" Buffy gathered their agenda together.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And who's behind it,\" added Vi who quickly paused after realizing that she had actually spoken the thought aloud. \"I was just thinking,\" she went on a little more hesitantly, \"you know how everything feels off? What if it's not just the witches and magic users, but all magic? Someone trying to disable the wards and natural protections around the hellmouth.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Everything's connected,\" murmured Kennedy, reciting Willow's catchphrase into the ensuing silence.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shared a look with Vi. If she was right, they had a serious problem on their hands. Natural magic was everywhere. According to Willow, it connected everything, made some places more sacred than others, prevented vampires from entering occupied homes, allowed essence to pass from a person to a treasured object, provided natural resistance to opening the hellmouth . . . the list went on.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Giles test that theory,\" said Buffy urgently, as aware as Xander of the formula for disaster. \"Xander, Vi, you guys take care of the meteor research. Kennedy, get in touch with Riley, let him know what's going on. Faith, Robin, get in touch with the rest of the watchers. And everyone start calling your slayers.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The call ended as they all hastened away to follow orders, the democracy of the Board falling away in crisis. Xander refused to let himself think of what could go down \xE2\x80\x93 or come up \xE2\x80\x93 if the wrong demons figured out that the Earth's magical forces had suddenly been drained. Crap. He got to his feet abruptly and went to the kitchen to make sure they had enough coffee.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Over the next day and a half, no one got any sleep. The girls stayed home from school to 'recover' from their fainting spells and everyone camped out in the dining room. Andrew took the books looking for any and all references to apocalyptic meteor showers while Dawn took the Internet, printing and processing whatever she could get her hands on. Diana and Xander called the slayers. Vi hit the streets to check out the usual demon bars and hangout for anything useful, though so far she'd only come up with confused and scared demons. Their contacts had no idea what was going on either and quite a few were packing up to leave town in self-preservation.</p>\n\
    <p>Vi and Diana's slayer strength was returning although slowly and only due to their proximity to the hellmouth. Elsewhere around the country, and globe for that matter, slayer powers were returning at about half that rate, which left none of them in any condition to fight. Going by Vi's estimation it would be another few days for her and Diana, and at least a week before the rest of them were up to full power.</p>\n\
    <p>Wednesday night, Giles confirmed that all magic, not just that of casters, had been ripped away by the force. The Bath coven had been knocked unconscious as Willow had though when they had awakened twenty-eight hours later, Willow had still been unconscious. Simple spells were impossible and normal magical objects were no longer expressing their otherworldly qualities. Dawn even tested the truth potion which failed to force Xander to say he had one eye.</p>\n\
    <p>But it was Dawn's report that was perhaps the most telling. \"All the places that were hit by meteors yesterday were communications arrays. And there's been reports of satellites down for a couple of companies.\" The phone was on speaker setting in the middle of the dining room table. The Board was all there with the exception of Willow.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you're saying that the meteors weren't meteors?\" asked Buffy through the speakerphone.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We think it's aliens,\" said Andrew with a quick look at Xander. They had talked about it earlier when Dawn had found the first news reports. Coupled with Jack's 'end of the world' timing, it made sense. Of course, they still had no proof.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Aliens,\" said Robin with a little skepticism.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander ignored him. \"Kennedy, did you reach Riley?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, he still hasn't gotten back to me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That still doesn't explain the drain of magical energy,\" said Giles getting back to Dawn's point. \"Only the meteor shower.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Which stopped after the drain,\" said Buffy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"But we haven't been invaded yet,\" Andrew pointed out. \"That means the aliens were stopped by the magic. We think.\" He grinned as he told them what he had figured out from watching way too many sci-fi movies.</p>\n\
    <p>There was a pause as the others took this in.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you saying the Earth is frickin allergic to alien attacks?\" asked Faith.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Whatever happened, if this is what Jack was talking about, the military knows,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Or at least has a place to start,\" said Buffy quietly. \"Xander, it looks like it's up to you guys to go chat them up.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Not till we hear from Riley,\" Xander said. He did not want to get locked up before he could even talk to someone.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Make it soon. We gotta figure out how to get the magic back in balance or we are so screwed.\" Talk turned then to status reports. In the US, the lack of mojo was still not common knowledge as far as they could tell. In Africa and South America communications were so bad there was no way to really tell. In Italy, however, word of the slayer's weakness had already spread leaving Buffy at a loss of what to do. She couldn't wait a week for her powers to come back \xE2\x80\x93 she needed them now. If word from Europe got across the ocean . . . well, Cleveland would probably become the next great demon vacation spot.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Riley finally called around five am Thursday morning, waking Xander from a fitful sleep. To make matters worse, he stubbed his toe on the doorframe as he stumbled across the hall to the office. \"'Lo?\" he said, sitting heavily at the desk, rubbing his poor foot.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander? Riley. I hope you have a suit.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What? Riley? Hi,\" Xander mumbled still mostly asleep. \"What did you say?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I got Kennedy's messages yesterday about the magic. Happened to us too. One of our mages is still in a coma,\" Riley explained sounding far more awake than necessary. \"If you're right about the barriers we are in deep shit.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Tell me about it,\" said Xander dryly as the sleep started to clear from his brain. He was sitting on the damn hellmouth.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We called out people in Washington,\" Riley went on. \"They talked to the Joint Chiefs who didn't give them the time of day till they mentioned your aliens.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What'd they say?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think they were a little upset about us knowing.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ouch,\" Xander sighed. Perfect, now the government was going to be after them on top of all this.</p>\n\
    <p>\"General Taylor backed us up though,\" said Riley.</p>\n\
    <p>\"General Who?\" asked Xander, more than a little surprised.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Army Chief of Staff. I've met him a few times. He's a good man. He's the one who keeps tabs on our operation and unofficially on yours.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?!\" This was news to Xander. \"Why didn't you ever tell us?\" he asked, feeling slightly betrayed.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Relax. It's strictly surveillance. He was in on the Initiative and knows better than to interfere. But he's got a vested interest in protecting his country too, you know.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right, sorry,\" Xander sighed. He really shouldn't have been surprised, and it was a credit to this General that he was staying out of their way.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Anyway,\" Riley went on. \"He's taking us seriously. When I got Kennedy's second message about the natural magic and the hellmouth and the Italian demons I called him and since I'm in the jungle, he got you clearance to learn about what happened and fix the problem.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Me?\" said Xander completely awake now from the jolt of adrenaline at the news. \"Why me?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's sending you to a military base. Who else is there? Dawn?\" Right, no high school students allowed. \"Now the people at the base haven't been cleared about the Council so don't tell them anything. Someone's picking you up at six. Codephrase: 'Lovely day to walk your dog to Mars'. Then you say 'Only if it's raining in Hell'. Got that?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"'Only if it's raining in Hell,'\" Xander repeated, the cloak and dagger stuff making him smile. Andrew was going to be so jealous. Then again, unless he wanted to be spouting codephrases for the rest of his life, he probably shouldn't tell him. But he would be so jealous. \"Thanks, Riley.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just doing my job,\" said his friend. \"Let me know what happens. I gotta get back.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good luck,\" said Xander before they hung up. He closed his eye, feeling a light draft waft through his uncovered eye socket. It was way too early to be up let alone thinking. With a final shake of his head, Xander went back to sleep for the remaining twenty minutes before he had to get up for real to meet whoever Taylor had sent to talk to him about Mars. After setting his alarm, Xander's last thought as he drifted back to sleep was that he didn't have a suit.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Xander didn't start to get nervous until they were driving up the mountain. He'd only been half-awake when Major Davis had showed up on the front step, then the car ride and subsequent flight to a still undisclosed location had put him soundly back to sleep. He'd tried to stay conscious, really, but his body had refused to cooperate.</p>\n\
    <p>Now that they were off the military transport and on their way to the mysterious base he couldn't ignore the worms crawling around in his stomach. Though that was partly hunger, which was a good thing because it gave him another thing to think about. Namely donuts.</p>\n\
    <p>His escort, Major Davis, hadn't been very chatty the whole trip aside from their initial meeting. Xander knew that he hadn't been expecting a kid with one eye hopelessly underdressed in khakis, dark blue button-down shirt, red snowman tie, and a winter jacket that had old gore stains on it. The covert looks the Major sent his way were still trying to puzzle him out. What a way to make an impression.</p>\n\
    <p>When they got to the base that went into the Cheyenne Mountain, Xander suddenly knew where they were. Jack's base. Major Davis led him through two checkpoints where Xander's driver's license and Council ID were checked and rechecked before they were allowed onto the elevator that went down ten floors before stopping. When they got off, they were at another checkpoint. Xander idly wondered if they had any confidence in the people upstairs at all as he once again showed them his ID. Paranoid didn't even begin to cover it. And then they got onto another elevator. And this one went down for a lot longer than ten stories.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Welcome to the SGC, Mr. Harris,\" Major Davis said when the elevator door finally opened. Xander shot him a startled look at the familiar designation that he wasn't supposed to know. SCG, Bluebook, Area 52 \xE2\x80\x93 really, really top secret military base that had at least one alien on staff. He took a deep breath and followed the Major down the cold gray halls. He sure hoped he didn't have to get out of here in a hurry because there was no way he was going to be able to remember all these twists and turns.</p>\n\
    <p>While they walked, Xander took in the uniformed men and women around him. Most were in plain green or blue fatigues striding purposefully from one place to another. They all looked at Xander curiously, their expressions guarded and evaluating. He tried to ignore the sensation of too many eyes crawling all over him, but it was rather difficult, too much like a vampire's gaze as it sized up dinner for comfort. It was almost a relief when they reached the conference room.</p>\n\
    <p>The conference room was very spacious and very empty when they arrived. The walls held tasteful hotel pictures except for one wall whose windows were covered by a blast shield. It took Xander a moment to process what was wrong at first and then it hit him \xE2\x80\x93 there were windows underground.</p>\n\
    <p>The center of the room was dominated by a large table surrounded by comfy looking chairs. Two flags stood against the far wall where another door stood ajar. Major Davis walked confidently up to it while Xander followed with a little more trepidation. He really shouldn't have been nervous since this was Jack's base and Jack had told General George about them. It should make everything easier in the long run, but nevertheless Xander felt like a kid dragged off to the principal's office. Or maybe that was the human in the vamp nest talking.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dr. Weir,\" said Major Davis knocking on the doorframe. Xander stopped short. Uh, Weir? he had a second to wonder as a tall, brunette woman stood from behind what was obviously her desk and came to greet them.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah, Major Davis,\" Dr. Weir smiled warmly, her eyes briefly meeting the Major's before settling on Xander. \"And you must be Director Harris from the International Watcher's Council.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, it's good to meet you,\" Xander managed without stammering as he shook her hand. Meanwhile his mind was doing some hasty rearranging. Not General George but Dr. Weir. Not someone who knew but someone who most definitely was not in the know, and wasn't supposed to. On the plus side she wasn't military. Which begged the question of what she was doing in charge of a military base. And . . . doctor of what?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Please,\" she gestured for the two men to join her at the conference table. Xander couldn't help but appreciate all the room it offered as he sat opposite Davis while Dr. Weir took the seat at the head.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dr. Weir, Mr. Harris has been authorized to be briefed on the Stargate Project, in particular, the events of the past few days to evaluate their impact,\" said Davis. Weir nodded, the introduction obviously a confirmation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I just got off the phone with the Joint Chiefs,\" she said with a small smile. \"They aren't much for giving notice. I'm afraid they didn't explain what your organization does exactly.\" Her voice turned upward in an invitation to explain.</p>\n\
    <p>Yeah right. Xander was very tempted to say 'classified' and leave it at that but he decided to be nice. \"Um, I can't really say other than that we are concerned with the fate of the world,\" he said as clearly as possible. Weir nodded and didn't look put out in the slightest. In fact, Xander had no idea what she was thinking. She was calm and collected and all the things Xander didn't feel at the moment.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Of course,\" she said. \"Well, as I was just briefed four days ago, I've asked Dr. Jackson to come join us as I'm sure he'll do a much better job of explaining.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're new here?\" Xander asked. He did some quick math in his head. Four days ago was after Jack had called but before the drain. Crap, power struggles.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" said Weir calmly. \"And yourself, how long have you worked for the Council?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Longer than four days,\" he replied which earned him another smile though he wasn't sure why. He didn't have time to ponder it however as the doors at the opposite end of the conference room burst open as a man barreled through.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sorry I'm late,\" the man said. His arms were laden with file folders, one hand gripping a cup of coffee. In green fatigues, it took Xander a moment to recognize him as Daniel. At the same moment, the haggard archeologist, who looked like Xander felt, stopped short as he caught sight of their guest.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander quickly shook his head at him and said hastily, \"Dr. Jackson, I presume?\" Please get it, please get it, he chanted mentally. If they knew each other, Weir would want to know why and then all these awkward questions would come up and Xander really wanted to avoid that. At all costs.</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel stared at him for a long second before snapping his mouth closed and saying, \"Uh . . . yeah, Daniel Jackson.\" He came around the table next to Davis and carefully put down his coffee and papers.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dr. Jackson, Director Harris of the Watcher's Council,\" Weir introduced them as they shook hands. \"He's here to be briefed on the project.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right.\" Daniel frowned briefly, then grabbed his folders, checking a few before sliding one over to Xander. \"Right,\" he repeated. He looked at the folder in his hand for a moment then looked up and fixed Xander with his gaze. \"The Stargate Project rose out of a discovery in 1928 on a dig in Egypt. An artifact was uncovered, a giant ring that had been purposefully buried.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"How big a ring?\" Xander interrupted as he tried to get a picture of it in his head.</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel grinned slightly. \"Big enough to walk through. Also covered in symbols. The US government ultimately took possession of the ring and a few years ago figured out what it was: a stargate.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"A gate to stars and aliens,\" said Xander in not quite a question. Across from him, Major Davis sat up straighter and frowned, obviously wondering how he'd jumped to that conclusion.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander spared him a glance. \"A meteor shower that only takes out communications arrays? I'm sure that was a coincidence. There is a reason we wanted to talk to you.\" He resisted the urge to roll his eye. He caught another grin from Daniel who continued.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Other planets actually. But essentially . . . aliens. In fact most of the people we encounter are humans descended from people here on Earth.\" Daniel paused to let that sink in, going on when Xander nodded. It did make sense and explained why Teal'c looked human and why the Air Force had archeologists. \"Originally they were taken there by another alien race called the Goa'uld who are a parasitic species that take humans as hosts. There's a picture in there.\" Daniel motioned for him to open his folder. Xander found the picture of the freaky snake-like thing that looked like a tentacle from the demon they had killed last August. Except smaller. \"The Goa'uld pretend to be gods and they take humans as slaves. Whole civilizations were uplifted and moved to other planets.\" Xander looked up at Daniel's tone, meeting eyes that mesmerized him with their intensity. \"They are pure evil. There is no talking, no negotiating, and no mercy. We've been at war with them for about seven years now.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander felt his heart clench, his mind going back to Jack's phone call in a panicked rush. \"And . . . they attacked,\" he said slowly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah. One of them.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked back at the picture, only half listening as Daniel rambled on about them being feudal and having their own armies and ships and not playing nice together. It was so small. He wondered how it took control over someone. Demons did it so many different ways \xE2\x80\x93 there used to be a book on parasitic ones that would burrow through your back or only attach after sex or eating. He wondered if this should be harder to wrap his head around.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Director Harris,\" Dr. Weir's gentle voice interrupted Daniel's flow. \"Are you all right? I know this is difficult but I can assure you that it is very real.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\" Xander looked up out of his thoughts into her sympathetic eyes. \"Yeah, real,\" he agreed absently. \"How does it take a host?\" he turned back to Daniel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Through the back of the neck or the mouth. They attach themselves to the brainstem. There's an MRI.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander flipped though his folder till he found it. It gave him the shivers just looking at it, a pale serpentine form wrapped around the brainstem. Ick. \"Now there's something that would drive you mad. I don't suppose they pay rent?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, no,\" said Daniel with another ghost of a smile, reaching for his coffee. Weir and Davis both shifted uncomfortably at the joke, which pleased Xander no end. Not so confident now, were they?</p>\n\
    <p>\"So the guy who attacked. What happened?\" he asked, putting aside the MRI for now.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Anubis,\" said Daniel. \"He wanted to take over Earth, kill us, enslave us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Doesn't like us much, does he,\" Xander commented.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We tend to piss them off,\" Daniel replied. Beside him Davis smiled a bit. Daniel went on and explained the happenings of the last few days. How the older, more advanced alien race that had made the stargates had left a weapon behind in an outpost in Antarctica. How they had recovered the location from a library device on another planet. How his CO, Jack O'Neill, now had so much information in his head from the device that his brain would deteriorate.</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel's eyes held Xander's as he told him this last bit, soft and kind while Xander felt an emptiness rush through him. \"He used his knowledge to activate the weapon which destroyed Anubis's fleet and afterwards he was frozen and placed in stasis. At least that's what we think.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Is he . . . alive?\" asked Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We think so.\"</p>\n\
    <p>But frozen in Antarctica with stuff in his head that could kill him. Would freezing him help?</p>\n\
    <p>\"Director Harris,\" Dr. Weir said, pulling him out of his introspection. \"What sort of analysis do you need of the last few days?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shook his head to clear it. Focus, he told himself. Twisting his thoughts away from Jack, he turned towards her. \"I need to know everything you can tell me about the weapon that was used,\" he said. From the descriptions, that had to be it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The weapon?\" said Dr. Weir. \"May I ask why?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Aren't you supposed to cooperate?\" he shot back.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Director, you were given clearance for the Stargate Project and recent events. It was not my understanding that you were allowed access to knowledge about a very powerful weapon.\" Weir's voice was stern but still on the right side of polite.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right, cause I'm gonna run home and make one in my backyard,\" Xander said before he could stop himself. \"Look,\" he said more seriously before Weir could say anything. \"Something happened when that weapon did its thing. Something drastic.\" Xander searched for words that wouldn't give too much away. \"I could care less about the weapon. If I wanted to blow something up I'd go steal a rocket launcher. So help me out here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Dr. Weir regarded him for a minute with that same unreadable expression while Xander tried to look sincere.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dr. Weir, there's no way he could get access to the site and with as little as we know about the Ancients' technology, it can't hurt,\" said Daniel into the silence. Finally Weir nodded.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm afraid there's not much we can tell you,\" she said, sitting back in her chair with a sigh. \"Access to the weapon has been severely limited due to the political situation. We're having difficulty getting even Colonel O'Neill back.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But you will get him back, right?\" Xander asked suddenly sidetracked by this news. Jack couldn't stay in Antarctica forever, cause even in stasis he would waste away.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, eventually,\" Weir smiled. \"Major Davis, the latest science report is on my desk, if you would.\" The Major nodded and went to fetch it, back a moment later. Weir smiled a thank you as she accepted it and slid it to Xander. \"What we do know is that the weapon is controlled mentally by a person, in this case Colonel O'Neill.\" Between her and Daniel, they explained the very vague particulars on how the weapon worked. Basically, you plugged in the power source, sat in a chair, and thought real hard for globules of energy to come out of the floor. The energy packets could be consolidated or could work independently of each other. Except Xander reasoned the energy was magic and what they thought was a power source was probably a key or something. Dangerous whatever it was if it unleashed the full magical power of the Earth. And now that magical power was in space. Great. Xander rubbed his eye tiredly as they finished up. Why couldn't this be easy? Just once?</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what's the prognosis?\" asked Daniel cautiously.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander smiled humorlessly, his gaze flickering from him to Weir and back. \"Do you want the bad news or the bad news?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"That bad?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"With the nice energy shake in space? We've got . . . issues,\" he said not sure if Daniel understood what he meant or not.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Issues?\" asked Weir sharply.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Xander nodded, unsure of how much more he could say. The scary part was, he had no idea what to do about it. The person best suited to solving this problem was Willow and she was either still unconscious or still sick from the backlash. And what were they going to do until the Earth naturally restored itself? Crap. Crap, crap, crap. With a cherry on top.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander leafed through the science report again, ignoring the words that were far too technical for him and focusing on the pictures of the underground room and the equipment covered in strange symbols. And then suddenly he was staring at Jack through a block of ice like some warped piece of art. He was staring at nothing, his face blank and lifeless, and Xander felt something akin to panic flutter in his chest. Jack in Antarctica, frozen with something in his head that would kill him if he woke up. It hit him then that he might not ever see him again, alive. This picture might be his last. Killed from knowing too much.</p>\n\
    <p>Abstractly, Xander knew he should be focusing on the weapon at hand, but Scooby instincts to protect people first and deal with the consequences later kicked in and he couldn't look away. \"What's been done about getting Jack back?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We're working on it,\" said Dr. Weir. \"Several countries have just been briefed on the Stargate Project given the recent attack and are reluctant to let us take anything from the site, but it is a priority. That's not really relevant to this discussion, however.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked up at her. \"So he's just being left there?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Director Harris \xE2\x80\x93 \"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's got all that stuff in his head that's killing him and you're just leaving them there?\" He couldn't believe it. Wasn't he the guy that had just saved all their asses by knowing what to do? Even if he inadvertently caused the drain to make the weapon work . . . And if he was left there he was as good as dead. Wasn't there some way they could fix him?</p>\n\
    <p>\"So this problem you're addressing,\" said Daniel slowly yet abruptly shifting topics. \"It has to do with the . . . energy . . . and how it works?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think so, yeah,\" said Xander watching the archeologist carefully as he obviously thought through something.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Then Jack should know,\" he said finally. Daniel sat up straighter but seemed hesitant to continue. \"He's got the knowledge of the Ancients who built the weapon. In theory if we revive him, he should be able to tell us what you need to know before . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"His brain leaks out of his ears?\" Xander suggested. It was obvious, of course, more so now that it had been thought out loud. And it was terrifying because that would only speed up the deterioration of Jack's brain once he was thawed, if it had even been stopped at all. He couldn't risk that, even if what he could tell them would help. \"Waking him up will kill him.\" And that was the bottom line.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We're working on that,\" Daniel shifted slightly in his seat with a quick glance at Davis. He tried to smile reassuringly though the worry never left his face. \"We're not going to let him die. We have some allies that can help and when they get here we can do it. We won't rush into anything.\" He turned to Weir. \"But there's got to be a way we can use that to get him back here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Peripherally, he heard Daniel, Weir, and Davis start talking diplomacy but he ignored them and instead looked back at the picture of Jack encased in ice, cold and dead-like. Xander wouldn't lose him this way. He couldn't. In his head he heard Jack's words come back to haunt him, words he'd shoved down with anger so they wouldn't become goodbye. Words he needed to hear again suddenly because sometimes being able to say goodbye was worth it.</p>\n\
    <p>There it was, the traitorous thought he'd managed to keep away for the last six days. Jack could die. Was probably going to, in fact. And Xander didn't want to lose him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How much can you tell us about why you need to know about the weapon?\" Weir interrupted his morbid thoughts.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nothing anyone would believe.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Then there's not much we can bargain with. Barring an act of God, this is going to be very difficult.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Then just go kidnap him in the middle of the night,\" Xander suggested the simplest answer he could think of. He probably should have kept his mouth closed given the raised eyebrows he was getting, though Daniel did seem more amused than shocked. \"Or something,\" Xander added hastily.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Not a bad idea,\" Daniel muttered and from the expectant look he gave Weir, Xander figured he must have been harping on getting his best friend back since it had happened.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dr. Jackson.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm just saying . . .\" Daniel lifted his hands in his defense.</p>\n\
    <p>Dr. Weir gave him a final warning look before she turned to Xander. \"We'll see what we can do. You're welcome to stay on base. Dr. Jackson, perhaps you could show Director Harris to the commissary?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sure,\" Daniel nodded, rising and gathering his things while Xander followed suit and shook hands with both Weir and Davis before following him out the door.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You want to see the stargate?\" Daniel asked as the exited through the door through which Daniel had entered. Xander didn't even have a chance to say yes as suddenly he was looking at it through the window of the control room they were in. It was large. Slate blue-gray in color with symbols and funny triangle things around its edge and a metal pinwheel across its face.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander stared at it for a second before saying the first thing that came to mind. \"That's cool!\"</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel grinned. \"Wait till you see it in action. Come on.\" With a last look at the portal to other planets \xE2\x80\x93 planets! Xander thought excitedly \xE2\x80\x93 he followed his guide down the steps into the corridor below. He almost wanted to try it. Andrew was going to be <i>so </i>jealous.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I was surprised to see you here,\" said Daniel giving Xander a quick look as they started down the hallway. \"You look like you've had a rough couple of days.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, well, getting all the magic sucked out of your body while your dad uses it to save the world on top of finding out that he might die afterwards will do that to you,\" Xander replied. That got Daniel's attention, his step faltering a second before reestablishing itself.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack called you?\" he asked. Xander nodded. \"And the . . . magic . . .?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander sighed and returned the curious gaze, clear and hiding nothing. Xander was relieved that there was someone else who knew about his world that he could talk to in this cold place. Another person who, even if he didn't get it all, wouldn't disbelieve him or the magnitude of what they were facing. It probably broke all the rules, but he didn't care. Rules were made to be ignored. \"I'll tell you over breakfast.\"</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Daniel and Xander's interesting breakfast took place in a forgotten corner of the dining hall and was joined midway through by Jack's other friends Sam and Teal'c. Xander eyed them carefully at first \xE2\x80\x93 he hadn't seen them since Christmas \xE2\x80\x93 but nevertheless recapped what he'd already told Daniel and finished with the guesses the Scoobies had made. Daniel and Sam both asked questions focusing on the details of the drain, which they accepted as magic with little protest, and on the nature of magic in the world and what its loss meant. Surprisingly, they knew more than Xander had first thought they did.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We had a long talk with Mr. Giles,\" Sam told him with an amused smile when he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And did a little reading on our own,\" Daniel added with a shrug. \"You'd be surprised at how many Internet sources there are on the supernatural the way you described it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Trust me. They're all bookmarked on our computer,\" Xander replied with a grin of his own that the others shared. Except for Teal'c who was starting to make Xander uncomfortable as always. Xander didn't think he would ever figure the guy out.</p>\n\
    <p>He took another bite of soggy French toast as silence fell over them briefly, the other three not bothering to fill it with chatter as they turned back to their own neglected cups of coffee. It was kinda funny how they had just pulled them into their circle. Sam and Teal'c's arrival had effectively shielded Xander from the rest of the room. At Christmas, he hadn't talked much with them beyond the little stuff so it was a little awkward not knowing what to say. But on the other hand, there was no pressure. Sam smiled when his eye met hers, and Daniel seemed to be distracted by his thoughts again. He was probably thinking about Jack, wondering like Xander was about what would happen to him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How was he when he . . . you know . . . fired the weapon?\" Xander asked suddenly. Jack's friends all looked at him then each other before Daniel answered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He'd already lost the ability to speak English,\" he said quietly. \"The migraines hadn't set in yet though.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So when they wake him up . . . You can fix him, right?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We've been trying to get in touch with the Asguard,\" said Sam. \"They took the library out of his head last time.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Asguard?\" Xander didn't recognize the name that must have belonged to the allies Daniel had mentioned earlier. And more importantly, \"Last time?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Another alien race with advanced technology,\" Daniel explained. \"We met them the last time it happened.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"O'Neill is friends with a commander in their fleet,\" added Teal'c. \"If they can help, they will.\"</p>\n\
    <p>The relief that surged through him that Jack had lived through this before was short-lived. \"When did you call them?\" The question sparked another round of worried looks and Xander knew that it had been far too long ago for comfort.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Last week when he downloaded the library,\" Sam told him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sensing a need for plan B,\" said Xander, abruptly putting down his fork. He wasn't so hungry anymore. Of course, what did he know about getting in touch with aliens, anyway? Even if the three people sitting with him thought it was taking too long and were worried and \xE2\x80\x93</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" said Daniel gently. \"We'll get him back.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You sure about that?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" said Teal'c, surprising Xander enough to look up at him. \"We will find a solution. If the Asguard do not come, then we will find a way to replenish the Earth's magical forces and your friend will restore him in your manner.\" The calm confidence in his voice was reassuring and the belief that Willow would be able to cure Jack comforting. \"O'Neill will never stop fighting. Do not give up on him.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know. I'm not. It's just . . .\" Xander picked his fork back up and started resolutely picking at his sodden toast, unsure how to put his feelings into words.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's your father,\" said Daniel for him, and Xander heard in his voice understanding of what he was going through because the three of them were struggling with the same thing for their friend, their brother.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Xander quietly agreed looking around at knowing eyes. And it didn't seem so weird that he was a part of this group, in this place, at this time. Not so weird at all.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>When they met back in the conference room a few hours later, Dr. Weir greeted them with a smile. \"Good news, gentlemen,\" she said. \"The ambassadors have managed to come to an agreement. Dropping the name of your organization did wonders for the negotiation,\" she looked at Xander with unvoiced questions undoubtedly running amok behind her eyes. \"Once the British ambassador heard you were looking into the situation he apparently disappeared to make a few phone calls and came back supporting Colonel O'Neill's return to us.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What can I say? We're connected,\" Xander said modestly, giving grudging points to the old Council.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, you are,\" Weir agreed with the unreadable look. \"We're expecting his return once the scientists have figured out how to get him here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thank you,\" said Xander in relief. One obstacle down, fourteen gazillion to go.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I've assigned you quarters in the VIP rooms while we wait. Until then I only ask that you stay with your escort.\" She nodded to the airman by the door. \"Dr. Jackson, if I might have a word?\"</p>\n\
    <p>The meeting obviously over, Xander went and followed his new friend to the ugly little room they'd given him a few floors up. Dark colors, boring walls, what was it with the military? And of course, absolutely nothing to do. So Xander did the only thing he could: kicked off his shoes, threw his coat on a chair, and went to sleep.</p>\n\
    <p>A few hours later a knock on the door woke him with a start, his new surroundings confusing him for a minute before he put two and four together to get three in the missing spot. When he got up to answer it, he found Daniel at the door grinning like a loon.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You're not gonna believe this,\" he said excitedly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack's here?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, not that, but almost as good,\" Daniel shook his head coming in. \"Kinsey has just been quarantined in the infirmary.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Kinsey? The guy who wanted me kidnapped?\" Xander stared at him. The Vice President of the United States Kinsey?</p>\n\
    <p>\"The very same. Did you know the President fired him during the attack?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He did what?!\" Xander found a chair and sat in it, Daniel joining him</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fired him. Dr. Weir just told me when she told me he was back and in quarantine.\" Daniel was still grinning. \"Apparently he tried to run to another planet to hide.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And the President fired him?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\" Daniel paused and looked thoughtful for a moment. \"You know under normal circumstances I would feel bad for the guy, but considering how much I hate him . . . Anyway,\" he pulled himself back from his rambling thoughts. \"He was on his way back to Washington when he suddenly developed a nasty case of boils on his ass.\" Daniel lifted innocent eyebrows at Xander who couldn't stop the glee from surfacing. \"Now the firing is . . . understandable. Normal even. But the boils . . . well they figure they're some sort of alien virus that he picked up here. Funny thing is, no one else seems to have the same symptoms.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You know, I have this friend,\" said Xander conversationally as he leaned back in his chair, very satisfied with life for the moment. \"And you really shouldn't try to hurt people she cares about. She gets a little cranky.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Daniel smiled, his arms crossed comfortably across his chest as he too sat back very satisfied with poetic justice. A major pain in the ass for the major pain in the ass. \"Does she like presents?\"</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>By dinnertime, Xander was bored. Very bored. All this free time waiting and nothing to do. Not even a TV to rot his brain on. He'd hung out with Daniel for a while, but he hadn't been too interested in all the translating stuff and eventually he'd drifted back to his room with a book on mythology that wasn't nearly as interesting as Daniel had said it was. He couldn't get out of there fast enough when the Sam came by to ask him to dinner.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, thank you!\" said Xander. \"I was ready to tear out the pages and play wasteketball. Here, take this,\" he handed off the book before harm accidentally befell it.</p>\n\
    <p>Sam only grinned at his antics. \"You're as bad as the Colonel,\" she said fondly, which made Xander shake his head in embarrassed pleasure. He was his own person, had been for a long time, but it was still nice to hear.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, you've had something to do all day,\" Xander defended himself. \"I have done nothing but catch up in sleep and imagine how much pain Kinsey must be in.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You guys really did it, didn't you?\" said Sam with a bit of amazement thrown in her tone. \"I honestly didn't think it would happen,\" she shook her head. \"When I heard he'd been fired, I thought Hayes had just finally seen him for the jerk he was. Nothing magic about that. But the boils . . . how the hell did you manage that?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Wishful thinking,\" Xander deadpanned. Sam cut her eyes at him with a look that told him she knew there was a little devil somewhere behind that innocent expression.</p>\n\
    <p>As they rounded the next corner, it took a few seconds for Xander to notice it. And when he did he though it was just the hall and the strange place. His steps slowed and Sam stopped as he did, staring at him curiously.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, are you all right?\" she asked, worry at his abrupt change in behavior now marring her brow.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander held very still, one hand coming up in the universal 'wait' gesture. Senses suddenly turned on to their max, he listened, his eye darting back and forth trying to pinpoint whatever it was, though he had a fairly good idea. Things were shifting. Subtly and more slowly than before, but nonetheless sliding back into place, feeling inexplicably right.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Something's happened,\" he said quietly, his eye finding Sam.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander?\" She stepped towards him and laid her hand lightly on his arm.</p>\n\
    <p>\"In Antarctica. Everything's right again. Or getting there faster than it was.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Everything . . .\" Sam trailed off getting it. \"We need to tell Dr. Weir.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No!\" said Xander. At Sam's startled expression he explained. \"If we tell her, I have to leave, and if I leave I won't see Jack.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We still need to figure out what caused the correction,\" said Sam. \"You don't have to leave till after we figure that out.\"</p>\n\
    <p>She was right, he supposed. They had to know what had changed so they would know what not to do to prevent the drain from ever happening again. At the moment though, Xander needed to make a phone call.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>In the end, Sam did convince Xander that they needed to tell Weir, but only after he called Giles so it looked like the confirmation was the original report. Weir listened and agreed that Xander could stay until the situation was resolved and after two days and a lot of confusing reports that Xander was only too happy to let Sam translate, they had an answer. Sort of.</p>\n\
    <p>The simple explanation was that it had to do with unplugging the thing Jack had plugged in. The complicated part had to do with connections and energy and Laws of Thermodynamics that made Xander's head hurt. The plan was still to pick Jack's brain before it up and walked out on him, but for that they were still waiting on the Asguard. Xander was waiting on Willow.</p>\n\
    <p>But Xander didn't really care about any of the 'whys'. As far as he was concerned, the crisis had been averted and he didn't really care about the details. All they had to do was not use the key thing again and they wouldn't have any more problems.</p>\n\
    <p>No, what Xander cared about was the other significant event that took place that day: the return of Jack's partially frozen body. He'd arrived that afternoon, the surprising de-stasitizing process already begun by the key's unplugging in Antarctica, but it was thankfully slow going. The doctors were all scratching their heads, trying to figure out how he wasn't dead as he slowly recovered his normal body temperature like a thawing turkey left to sit on the counter. At a loss, they had finally stopped hovering for the night. A little nurse distraction by Daniel and guard distraction by Teal'c and Xander found himself in a chair in the isolated room where Jack lay as still as death.</p>\n\
    <p>But not dead yet. Xander had been sitting there just watching him since Sam had left some twenty minutes ago. Silver hair framed a peaceful if pale face with lips that were a little too purple for comfort. Jack looked older, tired. Frail. It was at once frightening and heartening to see him there so vulnerable but still alive. The monitoring equipment hummed in the background.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I know I told you to call me,\" Xander finally broke the silence softly. \"But then you had to go popsicle on me and now I'm the one calling on you. I hate hospitals but I guess you know about that with Dawn and all.\" He stopped. They always said talking helped. Sometimes Xander wondered. \"Sure made a mess of things, huh? But it got you back anyway. Can you believe those guys, fighting over who gets what with you just stuck there? I'll never get politicians. Oh, and you'll never guess what happened to Kinsey . . . though I think I'll tell you when you wake up. You'd appreciate it more.\" He paused again while Jack continued to breathe in and out, in and out. Xander hated watching him. Hated sitting by his bed waiting. He hated knowing that the last thing he'd said had been harsh and cruel and deep in denial.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry I was mad at you,\" he said. \"I'm sorry I didn't let you finish saying what you needed to say. I just couldn't . . . couldn't think about losing you.\" Xander sat forward and rested his elbows on his knees letting his head sag down a moment before looking back up at the man who had just waltzed into his life last summer. Had it really been almost a year already? \"It was kind of scary actually. When you said you were proud of me. Not a run-for-your-life scared, but you know . . . It's been a long time since anyone's said that to me. My dad, Tony, when we talked he would yell. Of course, he was drunk most of the time \xE2\x80\x93 you can imagine how pleasant that was.\" Xander let out a dry chuckle. \"In less than a year and from another state you managed to be more my dad than he'd been since . . . a long time. I keep saying that \xE2\x80\x93 'long time.'</p>\n\
    <p>\"I guess what I'm saying is that you can't die on me, Jack. You can't die on me because I don't want it to be another long time before someone decides to hop a plane for me because of one crazy phone call in the middle of the night. Not that you have to do that every time, but it's the thought that counts, right? Right.\" He trailed off.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Teal'c says we'll find a way to put your marbles back in your head. You've got some cool friends, though I almost killed one of Daniel's books. Sam said I was as bad as you about that. I can see that. You know I have an irrational fear of old books? Comes from reading too many trying to save the world. Giles just loves them. It's always about the books with him. Though I did find a TV at his apartment back in Sunnydale, so there is proof that he's moved into the twentieth century. Hasn't made it to the twenty-first yet, but we're working on him. Did I tell you about how he killed his cell phone? There was a demon involved but I think Giles just used that as an excuse.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander rambled on, talking about anything and everything that popped into his head. He didn't know how long he sat there, just that he couldn't stop talking. He talked until he no longer made sense to himself and the pauses between ramblings grew longer and longer. The whole while, Jack breathed in and out, in and out, steady and strong until he seemed to be more sleeping than just lying there half-dead. And when Teal'c came in and told him to go to bed, Xander left feeling at peace for the first time since Jack's phone call. His father might not have been out of the woods yet, but he was going to be fine.</p>"

    <p>The tree-house is a godsend.<br /> <br /> John's boys are good kids, but they're still <em>kids</em>, full of energy and liable to get into every which thing. It's a marvel John can keep them under control as well as he does; Dean with his itching desire to take apart any goddamned piece of machinery he sees, whole Sam trails around after him getting into everything and asking questions until it's enough to drive a man to drink. It wouldn't be so bad if he and John were just working in the yard - Dean at least is plenty old enough to learn his way around the innards of a car; pretty handy at it, too - but if the case they're working as anything John could do in front of the boys, he probably wouldn't be here.</p>
    <p><br /> The first week they're happy enough exploring the yard, scoping out their territory. Dean sets to climbing every tree in the orchard, Sammy following doggedly behind him, red-faced and determined as he struggles to keep up. They tackle all the little fruit trees first, leaving the ash tree out on the west of the property till last. It's not the hardest tree to climb, but it's the biggest, been there longer than the house has. Dean shins up the trunk first and ties a rope to the lowest branch, but Sam ignores the help, kicking off his shoes so he can dig toes as well as fingers into the cracks in the bark. When he finally makes it he persuades Dean to carve both their initials into the bark, and they both sit there all afternoon, grinning out over the valley.</p>
    <p align="center"><br /> Once they've cracked the ash tree, though, they're both back to poking around the yard, looking for mischief to get into. So when John leans back one evening and says, 'Used to build treehouses when I was a kid', Bobby seizes on it for the inspiration it is.</p>
    <p align="right"><br /> "Built one or two myself. We had a great treehouse out on my granddaddy's old place, big enough me and both my brothers could fit it." He takes a long pull on his beer, pretending like he can't see the way Dean and Sammy have both pricked up their ears. "He had a big old ash tree, like that one out back."<br /> <br /></p>
    <ul>
    <li>John nods wisely, the corner of his mouth twitching as he says, "Yeah, that's the right kind of tree, sure enough."</li>
    <li>Sam lets out a little squeak of excitement, and Bobby has to take another drink before he can compose himself enough to speak. "'Course, it was a mighty lot of work. Can't think kids nowadays would have the sticking power."</li>
    <li>"<em>We</em> would, Uncle Bobby!" Sam bursts out. "We could build one, couldn't we, Dean?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Dean shushes him, saying, "It's not our tree, Sam," but his face is just as shining and hopeful as his brother's.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Bobby catches John's eye. "I got no objections."</li>
    <li>Finally he relents. "If you really want to do this, you've gotta do it right, you hear? That means you too, Sammy. You mind what your brother tells you."</li>
    </ol>
    <p><br /> <br /> <strong>He fixes Dean with a stern look. "And you look after your brother. We don't need any broken necks."</strong><br /> <br /> <u>The two of them <em>yessir</em> and <em>nosir</em>, nodding fervently, and the second John dismisses them they burst out into the yard, already arguing about the best way to plan the project and whether or not it's dumb to give the tree-house windows.</u> Bobby remembers that the first time he built a tree-house, he dragged half the lumber he could find up the tree before stopping to figure out how it would all fit together, but Dean and Sam have the whole thing sketched out on paper before they even start looking for materials. And if the yard yields some surprisingly useful scraps - well, it just goes to show that planning pays off.<br /> <br /> <strike>Between keeping an eye on the boys and finding ways to keep them well-supplied with building materials, Bobby and John finish up the job they've been working on. The demon they've been after leaves them both bloody and exhausted</strike> before they manage to send it back to hell, but even so, it's only a couple of days before John's edgy and restless, hunting through newspapers and clipping out obituaries and disappearances.<br /> <br /> When he starts hunting through the maps,</p>
    <p>looking for one of Ohio,</p>
    <p>Bobby observes mildly,</p>
    <p>"They've only just finished that tree-house."</p>
    <p><br /> "I know," John says regretfully, but he doesn't stop comparing the scribbled notes he's made against the unfolded map.</p>
    <p><br /> <br /></p>

    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>Bobby watches   him thoughtfully, thinking about the pleased-proud look on Dean's face when   they pronounced the tree-house safe. "You can pick them up after the   job's done."</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>John does pause   then, looks up slowly, like if he moves too quick Bobby'll take it back.   "You're a good man, Bobby."</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>"Not   particularly." Bobby fishes in his pocket for his pack of cigarettes, a   habit he still hasn't gotten around to quitting. "Just mind you pick   them up before the school year starts."</strong></p>

    <tr>
    <td width="239">
    <p><strong>John leaves the   boys at the yard the next summer, too, but the one after that he calls and   says he's keeping them with him, holing up in a cabin in the woods somewhere   while he hunts down a possible Raksha. "The boys are old enough   now," he says. "Dean can handle a gun like you wouldn't believe."</strong></p>

    <p><strong>They don't come   by that summer, though, and by the next they're on the other side of the   country, and Bobby's busy with his own affairs. He sees them off and on over   the next few years, but always for one-off jobs, and they don't make it back   to his place. Figures that John's heard the message in Bobby's silences and   chosen to deal with it his own way.</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><br /> He's less surprised than he should be when the letters start to arrive. The   first two he just stashes in the bookcase and forgets about. When the third   one arrives, though - thick and heavy with promises - he picks up the phone.   He doesn't need the return address on that thick envelope - <em>Stanford University</em> - to tell him that   John doesn't need to know about the letters. Instead he says, "Got a job   I could use your help with," brushing aside John's surprise at the call.<br /> <br /></p>
    </td>
    <td width="239">
    <p><br /> It's a shock when Bobby makes the rendezvous to find John standing there with   two young men. Not like he didn't know the boys were growing up, but there's   knowing and then there's seeing Dean standing shoulder-to-shoulder with John,   plotting out hunt strategies while Sammy towers over them both.<br /> <br /></p>

    Section 25: Of Cabbages and Kings<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"What will she do to him?" demanded Aeryn as soon as the door clanged shut behind them.</p>
    <p>"I don't know," said Jack tightly with a quick glance at Daniel. Watching the by-play, she guessed that even if he didn't know, he had a frelling good idea.</p>
    <p>"What is it?" asked John, picking up the same vibes. They were standing with their shoulders touching, facing the four humans - or three humans and one reformed Jaffa. Aeryn resisted the urge to beat an explanation out of one of them.</p>
    <p>"He's our friend and we deserve to know," she said dangerously. After another moment, Jack nodded.</p>
    <p>"We can't be sure since D'argo is a different species, but she could want to find out what he is, what he's made of. Some Goa'uld tend to . . . experiment," Daniel fixed his gaze on the far wall. "Of course, Nit, or Neith in the classical Egyptian pantheon was originally a goddess of war in the Sais region of Lower Egypt in the Predynastic era. She might not even be interested in redefining the perfect soldier. She could just be curious."</p>
    <p>"Well, that's a relief," Jack said sarcastically.</p>
    <p>Daniel merely flicked him a glance. "Yeah, well, she was also the patron of weaving, and according to one set of myths, the mother of Ra and Sobek."</p>
    <p>"And this means what exactly?" asked Aeryn tensely. The strange names added only more confusion and frustration, rather than clearing things up. Beside her, John was just as confused.</p>
    <p>"It means she's old and the mother of one of the snakeheads we killed. Not a happy camper," Jack summed up.</p>
    <p>"Torture?" asked John flatly.</p>
    <p>"Yeah," Sam confirmed.</p>
    <p>Aeryn felt John tense as her own skin went cold, too many recent memories surfacing in her mind. "What about the rest of us?" she asked quietly.</p>
    <p>Jack and Daniel shrugged in unison, their own faces as closed off as Teal'c's. Sam for her part looked worriedly at her two teammates, and Aeryn knew they had been captured and tortured before. And killed.</p>
    <p>"What were they calling you in there?" John asked, breaking the heavy silence that had draped over them.</p>
    <p>"What?" Daniel appeared to mentally shake himself.</p>
    <p>"Those names. Tory - n - shovel," John clarified.</p>
    <p>"Oh. Taur'i and sholva," Daniel corrected him. Nearby Sam and Jack slid down the wall to sit on the floor. " 'Taur'i' is the Goa'uld word for humans form Earth. It's our tribe if you will. 'Sholva' means traitor. They're talking about Teal'c because he defected to us. It's not a very nice word."</p>
    <p>Aeryn laughed harshly. "They seldom are." Silence settled over them once more as did the weight of thinking dark thoughts that came with waiting in a cell. Aeryn wandered with John over to the door, but found that Jack had been right. There was nothing they could do from the inside. Finally, she and John settled against the opposite wall from the others. Teal'c sat cross-legged with his eyes closed much like Zhaan used to when she meditated.</p>
    <p>"So, got any names picked out yet?" asked Jack. Startled, Aeryn looked at John who tried not to look guilty about having told them about the baby. When she simply smiled he grinned back.</p>
    <p>Aeryn shook her head, still caught up in John's gaze. "No, not really."</p>
    <p>"What, no John Jr.?"</p>
    <p>"I'm already a Junior," John sighed with another wry grin for the Colonel. "It was bad enough growing up in my dad's shadow, worse with his name. And with my rep in the Territories . . . no way."</p>
    <p>"What about other family names?" asked Sam. "That's what my brother and his wife did. One from each side."</p>
    <p>"How 'bout it, Aeryn? Any juicy names from your family?"</p>
    <p>The ex-peacekeeper smiled sadly. "We named Moya's son after my father," she said. "He died a cycle ago."</p>
    <p>"I'm sorry," said Daniel.</p>
    <p>"Moya had a son?" Jack asked curiously. "Another ship?" Aeryn nodded. "How did he die?"</p>
    <p>"A warrior," Aeryn answered. Even now, it still felt like only yesterday that she was helping Moya calm him down after he was born. She wondered if time would pass as quickly for her own child.</p>
    <p>"What about your mother's name for a girl?" asked Daniel. His attempt at lightening the subject failed as Aeryn thought of her mother, a woman destroyed by her love for a man she was forced to kill and the daughter she grew to hate.</p>
    <p>"I have no mother."</p>
    <p>"Aunts, uncles, grandparents?" asked Jack.</p>
    <p>"I have this crazy uncle Pete," said John, diverting attention away from her. As he launched into a story about roadsters and cops, Aeryn took his hand in a silent thank you. He squeezed her hand back.</p>
    <p>"We are not naming him Pete," Aeryn told them when he finished.</p>
    <p>"Why not? Pete's a great name!" John protested.</p>
    <p>"I don't like it."</p>
    <p>"You could name him Daniel, or Danielle if it's a girl," suggested Jack cutting his eyes at his friend who immediately protested.</p>
    <p>"Jack!"</p>
    <p>"What? You have a good solid name. Nothing to be ashamed of."</p>
    <p>"I'm not ashamed of it, but I hardly think they should name their child after me."</p>
    <p>"Sam!" Jack snapped his fingers. "Good for a boy or a girl . . ."</p>
    <p>"How about Jack?" Sam glared at her commanding officer. "Or Jonathan."</p>
    <p>"Hey!"</p>
    <p>"That's your first name?" asked John.</p>
    <p>Jack rolled his eyes and nodded. "Could be worse I suppose. Could be something like Angus."</p>
    <p>"You know when we get back to Earth we can get you guys a baby name book," said Sam.</p>
    <p>At the mention of Earth, they all fell silent. Jack and Sam glanced around their cell, looking for anything they missed.</p>
    <p>"So anyone come up with an escape plan?" asked John.</p>
    <p>"Carter?"</p>
    <p>"We're in a pretty primitive lockup, sir. We're not getting out until we're let out."</p>
    <p>"Too bad there are no Jaffa to sweet talk."</p>
    <p>"Or steal weapons from," added John.</p>
    <p>"So how did you two get out of that prison we rescued you from?" asked Daniel</p>
    <p>John smiled slightly. "We used the sick prisoner trick. Knocked out the guards when they came in."</p>
    <p>"I do not believe that will work here," said Teal'c, startling them all with his return to the conversation.</p>
    <p>"No," Jack agreed. "We'll have to try something else. Something that will hopefully take out the Nitwit while we're at it."</p>
    <p>"And get D'argo."</p>
    <p>"And get D'argo."</p>
    <p>Aeryn only prayed he was still alive.</p>

    Section 26: Snake Charming<p>This part is rated PG-13 for content.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>His eyes never left her while she looked him over. A curious smile that held everything except warmth drifted lazily across her lips. D'argo stood there calmly as if being inspected like a slave by his captor were not nerve-wracking. All he had to do was not be the prisoner she expected and he would have the advantage. He just hoped she didn't get him angry because then all the control he had would be gone.</p>
    <p>"You are an interesting creature," Nit broke the silence. She waved a hand at her handmaidens who scurried away and out the side door. "Can you speak?"</p>
    <p>"Yes," D'argo replied solemnly in his own language.</p>
    <p>Nit frowned. "Not intelligent, I see."</p>
    <p>"I can speak," he repeated, this time in John's tongue. Nit raised her eyebrow in surprise.</p>
    <p>"Interesting. . . . you look nothing more than a beast of burden," she said.</p>
    <p>"Oh, I am quite more than that," D'argo returned softly. He caught her eye and held it, refusing to back down.</p>
    <p>"So it seems," said Nit, a different, speculating gleam entering her eye. "Why do you travel with the Taur'i? You are their ally?"</p>
    <p>"It suits my purpose to travel with them."</p>
    <p>"And what purpose would that be?"</p>
    <p>"My own."</p>
    <p>A blow from behind knocked him forward to the ground, but even surprised, D'argo refused to make a sound.</p>
    <p>"Answer me," Nit commanded dangerously. It was a show of power and dominance, a game D'argo had learned to play with John. The Luxan got to his feet defiantly and glared at the woman.</p>
    <p>"And what do I get in return? What will you offer me in their place?"</p>
    <p>"You are hardly in a position to bargain, Beast," said Nit dismissively. The hard footsteps of the Jaffa edged closer to him from behind. "I will get an answer from you one way or another."</p>
    <p>"Then you know nothing of the Luxan people!" D'argo spat back. "I will be dead before you have even finished torturing me. And my knowledge of these Taur'i with me."</p>
    <p>"Bold words," Nit said coldly. "You will soon regret them when you are begging for your miserable life."</p>
    <p>D'argo felt a knot of cold dread coalesce inside him as she called his bluff. Now what?! He furiously racked his brain trying to think of what to say that would save his hide from a grisly death. What would John do? Aeryn? Frell, what would Chiana do? D'argo knew he didn't have the acting skills John did or the talent to talk his way out of a tight spot. Even Aeryn could play the soldier that slipped under everyone's senses. And Chiana was simply one of the best liars he knew, not to mention the fact that she knew how to use her body to her full advantage. And what did D'argo have? Nothing he could use here.</p>
    <p>"What? No brave reply?" asked Nit smugly. She retreated to her throne, what there was of her dress swaying suggestively from her curves. She was a woman with more than one kind of power and she knew it.</p>
    <p>"I was just wondering," D'argo said, the words coming to him as he spoke, "what good would I be to you mutilated beyond recognition?"</p>
    <p>Nit raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow in question. "I would have your knowledge and the satisfaction of your painful death."</p>
    <p>"There are other ways to be satisfied," said D'argo slowly. "Other ways to gain my cooperation."</p>
    <p>"And why should I . . . cooperate with you?" Nit seemed amused by his proposition.</p>
    <p>"Why would you not?" asked D'argo, dropping his voice another tone the way that always made Chiana shudder. Nit blinked slowly. When she opened her eyes, they swept over him from head to foot, the speculating gleam returning.</p>
    <p>"You are a beast."</p>
    <p>"Would you prefer one of you sniveling slaves?"</p>
    <p>"You would try to kill me."</p>
    <p>"If you are truly a god then you cannot be killed," D'argo pressed. Slowly, confidently he stepped towards her, never breaking the eye contact that had her mesmerized. "Are you not a god?" he challenged playfully.</p>
    <p>"I am Nit! And you are my prisoner."</p>
    <p>"Then you have nothing to fear from me." Step. "And everything to gain." Step. "Why would I stay with the weak humans," step, "when there is you?" Step. "So beautiful."</p>
    <p>He was a mere two metras from her now, close enough to see that she truly was beautiful if one liked exaggerated perfection. D'argo found it somewhat repulsive for all that he was male. But he didn't let her see that. Nit instead was preening under his attention, convinced she was going to get everything she wanted.</p>
    <p>"You will do my bidding," she said.</p>
    <p>"And more," D'argo replied with a rakish grin. "If not you can still torture me."</p>
    <p>"Do not believe that option has lost its appeal."</p>
    <p>"Then tie me up. . . and do what you will."</p>
    <p>The piercing look she gave him spoke of smoldering fires about to burst into flame. "Jaffa!" she cried without looking up. "Leave us!" Neither one of them spoke as the remaining soldiers filed out and the door clanged shut behind them. "Come," Nit stretched out a hand to D'argo, inviting him to close the remaining space between them.</p>
    <p>D'argo grinned viciously. "You are a fool," he said, and before Nit had a chance to be surprised, he shot out his tongue and knocked her human body unconscious with a venomous blow to her neck. Nit crumpled at his feet.</p>
    <p>Smiling in satisfaction at his own cleverness, D'argo bent down to finish her off with a clean snap of the neck. Rather dishonorable, he conceded, but easier than having her come after him later when he was trying to rescue the others. Now he just needed to get past the guards and find John and Aeryn and his Qualta blade. Then all they had to do was get back to that circle thing and get back to Moya. Right. No problem.</p>
    <p>Preoccupied by his miserable thoughts, D'argo didn't hear the slithering sound from the body until it was too late.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>I know some of you probably won't buy that Nit is that stupid, but think about it, she's an out of the loop Goa'uld surrounded by people who always do what they're told confronted by one sexy Luxan. (If you haven't seen D'argo, just take my word for it, he's got the stuff!) Until next time.</p>

    <hr>\n\
    <p>AN: I went back and fixed several things in chapter 14. It's nothing major, just a few flow and reaction adjustments. I'd like to thank everyone who reviewed that chapter, especially those who pointed out its weak points.</p>\n\
    <p>SPOILER WARNING: Very, very minor spoilers for the Lost City. You might not even notice them they're so tiny.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Fifteen Thousand Miles From Earth</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>When Xander innocently passed by the infirmary the next morning, he was surprised to meet Dr. Weir in the hallway about to go in. \"Director Harris,\" she greeted him warmly with her customary professional politeness.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dr. Weir,\" Xander nodded back.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I was just going to check on Colonel O'Neill. Would you care to join me?\"</p>\n\
    <p>A bit startled by the offer, Xander nodded and followed her through the infirmary door. A nurse noticed their arrival and went to fetch the doctor on duty who was introduced as Dr. Brightman. She sighed when Weir asked about Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"According to our estimates, he will be physically recovered by early tomorrow morning. His vital signs all show consistent improvement which is accelerating as he warms up. The levels still lay well below survivable hypothermic conditions, but he's alive.\" The doctor seemed at a loss to explain. \"None of us have ever seen a thermal recovery like this before. We think it must be linked to the anomalous reading we saw in the MRI yesterday. We have another one scheduled for 1100. Hopefully we'll know more then.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And the brain damage?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"As far as we can tell, that process has been retarded as well,\" said Dr. Brightman. \"For recovery, from what I understand it will be impossible without the Asguard. You can go on and see him, if you wish.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thank you,\" said Weir. Dr. Brightman led them to the private room and left them at the door. Xander was surprised to see Teal'c sitting by Jack's bed. He rose when they entered.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dr. Weir, Xander Harris,\" he greeted them. After a moment, he added, \"Would you like privacy?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, please. Thank you,\" Weir nodded. Bowing slightly and giving Xander a lingering look, Teal'c left.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack seemed much as he had the night before, like he was sleeping. The monitors were all still attached and providing background noise. Weir moved to the foot of the bed and was silent. Unsure, Xander hesitantly came and stood beside her, his own thoughts revolving around tomorrow and what would happen then.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I understand you lost your escort last night.\" Taken by surprise, Xander turned to the woman beside him like a deer in headlights. \"You came here?\" She looked at him already knowing the answer.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" said Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"May I ask why?\" But he remained silent, tearing his gaze away from her to the still body on the bed. \"Director Harris, please understand I'm not accusing you of anything,\" Weir said. \"You've been spending most of your stay here with SG-1, and last night they sneaked you in here where you sat till nearly four this morning. You haven't been very forthcoming in your reasons for being here and if you have an ulterior motive, I'd like to know.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander almost laughed. Sure he had an ulterior motive: making sure Jack lived, but there wasn't much he could do about that at the moment. First he had to finish thawing, then he had to call Giles to see what could be done, see if Willow was okay, or barring that another witch, hopefully closer. He might have to call LA. Angel was sure to have someone who could pull off the tricky magic, though it killed Xander to ask the vampire.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Daniel and Teal'c let me in. Shouldn't that speak for it self?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It begs the question to why.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It has nothing to do with why I'm here.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right, Director Harris,\" Weir's voice sharpened and when he looked, her gaze was as cool and commanding as any slayer's, one that said don't-mess-with-me. \"I will accept that for now. But understand that this man is under my command and that any threats to him will be dealt with accordingly.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm not a threat.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just so we're clear,\" said Weir. She turned and started heading for the door.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander watched her back for a full second before he impulsively called out, \"He's my father.\" Weir turned, raised eyebrows the only show of surprise at his announcement. \"You can ask Daniel or Teal'c or Sam,\" he added. If she wanted more proof he bet he could find the paternity confirmation at Jack's house, but he didn't think he needed it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I didn't know he had a son,\" she said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You've only been here a week.\" Weir nodded in acknowledgment, eyes darting from Jack to him as she absorbed this new information. \"Thanks though,\" added Xander. At her inquiring look he smiled. \"For threatening me. It means a lot.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Weir smiled in return. \"Thank you for telling me.\" With a final nod she left him to his visit.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander sighed as he settled into the chair Teal'c had recently vacated, a mixed feeling of pride and dread clenching his stomach. His gut instinct about her better not be wrong, he thought, but he didn't think it was.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dr. Weir, please come to the briefing room,\" the PA system requested. Xander looked up curiously but knew that until his name was called he wouldn't be welcome. So he stayed and wondered how the girls were doing at home, prayed there wouldn't be anyone else in the hospital, and that Andrew was still in one piece. He didn't know how much time had passed as he let his thoughts wander to friends far and wide.</p>\n\
    <p>But when Jack's body disappeared in a flash of white light he was up and running out the door before his heart had started beating again.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Numb . . . cold . . . floating . . . There were noises around him . . . humming but not a song. There was light . . . then it was gone. Words, smells, all faded back into fog. There was no hurry. What would come would come. He was safe.</p>\n\
    <p>Time melted. Sounds came again more insistently. Familiar sounds that converged into words that Jack knew. Questions asked that he had answers to. Answers that faded and words that transformed into gibberish that he couldn't understand. Awareness slowly pushed back the fog. He tried to open his eyes, but they were heavy. He sighed in frustration and tried again. The voices stopped.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack?\"</p>\n\
    <p>He opened his eyes. \"Daniel?\" Slowly turning his head at the semi-familiar surroundings, he found his friend smiling at him, arms crossed across his chest. And beside him was another, much shorter friend. \"Thor!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Greetings, O'Neill. It is good to see you well,\" the tiny gray alien inclined his head briefly before coming over and releasing him from the medical pod. Still stiff, sore, and cold and with a cruising headache, Jack slowly sat up and swung his legs over the side. The first thought that came to mind was to wonder what was he doing here, but through the haze in his head, he remembered, the planet with the library. That was about it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack?\" asked Daniel concerned now.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Anubis?\" he asked. Daniel nodded.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No longer a threat. How much do you remember?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Not much.\" It wasn't so much a haze anymore as a blank, with pieces snapping out too fast too see every once in a while. He tried to identify them as Daniel recounted the last couple days of the mission.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And then you put yourself in stasis,\" Daniel finished.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How long?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Five days. You actually started defrosting when they removed the power source from the chair two days ago. Thor got here this morning.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Impeccable timing as ever,\" Jack smiled at Thor.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I am only sorry I could not arrive sooner.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, you got here,\" Jack said lightly. He stood up to protesting muscles, experimentally stretching his arms. The burning stretch felt refreshingly good. \"Don't happen to have anything for a headache, do you?\" But Thor shook his head.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We should probably be getting back,\" said Daniel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh? What's up?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think I'll let Xander explain.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack stopped and did a double take at his friend who was most definitely sporting a grin and waiting for him to ask. Jack didn't disappoint him. \"Xander is at the SGC?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"My Xander.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Showed up three days ago.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Daniel,\" Jack growled at his friend for withholding information.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Who is Xander?\" interrupted Thor. \"And why is he yours? Does not your race abhor slavery?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What? No,\" Jack started, turning to the short alien. \"Xander's not a slave or anything.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Then how is he yours?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack stared at him for a long moment then said, \"He's my son.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Your offspring?\" Thor actually seemed surprised. \"I did not realize that you had any.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, well,\" Jack shrugged. Neither had he. \"And he's at the SGC?\" he turned back to Daniel who nodded.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I think I would like to meet your offspring,\" said Thor.</p>\n\
    <p>But Jack still had more questions for Daniel and only told the Asguard commander, \"Sure,\" before asking his teammate in a carefully deliberate voice. \"Why is Xander at the SCG?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well \xE2\x80\x93\" was as far as Daniel got when the sound of an Asguard transporter interrupted.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What the \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Are you Xander?\" asked Thor. And sure enough, Jack's son was standing on Thor's ship.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ahhhgg!\" Xander jumped back when he caught sight of diminutive Supreme Commander, his hands reaching for his belt, no doubt for a weapon that wasn't there. Shell shocked by his sudden . . . appropriation, Xander could only stare. Jack didn't know whether to laugh or jump up and hug him. Or yell at Thor, though he really wasn't angry at the little guy.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thor!\" said Daniel at the exact same time that Jack said, \"Xander!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack!\" the young man was clearly surprised to see him alive and well.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, kid. How's it going?\" Jack sauntered over, grinning at the utter confusion on his son's face as he darted looks from Thor to Jack and Daniel to the sleek grey room they stood in. Numbly he took Jack's offered hand.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay. Stop.\" Xander closed his eye and shook his head, disbelief in every line of his face when he opened it again. \"Explanations would be good now. The whole disappearing, shiny room, and you not half dead and crazy, and please tell me I'm hallucinating,\" he glanced at Thor.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack grinned at the confused string of words. \"You're not hallucinating.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Okay. Right. You sure? 'Cause I'd be happy to be.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, I'd like you to meet Thor, Supreme Commander of the Asguard Fleet. Buddy of mine, well known for coming and saving our butts every once in a while.\" He got another long incredulous stare before Xander blinked and let go of his hand. He eyed Thor up and down warily before glancing back at Jack to see if it was a joke. Jack grinned and nodded back towards Thor was waiting patiently. Xander took a deep breath and offered his hand.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nice to meet you,\" he said. \"Sorry about all that, just not used to the transporter thing.\" And when their hands shook, Xander broke out into a grin. \"My friend Andrew is going to be <i>so</i> jealous.\"</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>By the time Jack and Daniel had finished explaining the healing thing, Xander's heart was back in his chest. He'd spent half the discussion staring at Thor who had been just as curious about him it seemed. Xander found that once he'd wrapped his head around the fact that he was on a spaceship, everything else was easier to accept. Just another factor of weirdness to add to his already weird life.</p>\n\
    <p>Thor was nice too. He showed Xander around the control room and answered his half joking questions about ray guns and shields (which he had after a fashion) and photon torpedoes (which he didn't) with utmost seriousness. Jack and Daniel were amused, both adding comments here and there. \"You should see the Goa'uld run in fear of these babies,\" Jack said of the ship.</p>\n\
    <p>All and all Xander was rather impressed. And a little disappointed. Thor and his ship were pretty cool in and of themselves, but the barrenness of the interior felt cold and hard. Alien. He shook his head ruefully as they reconvened back by the tube bed. That was the point wasn't it? That this ship and the little person with big black eyes were from another planet. They were not a part of the Earth.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So why did you bring me up here?\" Xander asked once the tour was over.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I wanted to meet the offspring of my friend O'Neill,\" said Thor in his soft and formal tones. Xander looked over at Jack who shrugged back.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh,\" Xander didn't know what else to say.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what do you think?\" Jack saved him from adding anything else. \"Good kid, huh?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander glared. \"I'm hardly a kid,\" he groused, but both Thor and Jack ignored him, while Daniel gave him a sympathetic smile.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He possesses your same instinct for humor,\" Thor nodded. \"And he carries himself well in the face of new experiences.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah well,\" Xander shrugged embarrassed, \"this is hardly the weirdest thing I've ever seen.\" One of the weirdest, but face it, he'd <i>dated</i> weirder.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what were you doing at the SGC anyway?\" asked Jack. He was sitting back on the pod like he had when Xander had first arrived, reminding him that not four hours ago, Jack had been hooked up to a bunch of machines to make sure he was still alive. It almost bothered him that he'd gone through all the trouble of worrying about him to just find him here on this ship, healthy as a clam. The technology around him a kind of magic in its own way.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh you know, looking for the Earth's magical energy,\" Xander said lightly though he felt anything but. He was rewarded with two incredulous eyebrows rising. \"That weapon you used ripped the magic from the Earth.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"The power source looks like it's really a conduit for channeling magical power,\" said Daniel. \"It acts like a magnet \xE2\x80\x93 or it enables one \xE2\x80\x93 that draws power from the Earth. We tried to ask you about it while you were recovering and you kept repeating 'One world, one life, one source,' over and over no matter how I asked the questions. So we went ahead and woke you up.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He did?\" asked Xander</p>\n\
    <p>\"I did?\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Those were the only words,\" Thor confirmed. \"They do not make sense to me, nor does this magical force that Dr. Jackson told me of.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's like doing stuff with technology without the technology,\" Xander tried to explain. \"You say some words, sometimes you need a ritual, and you make stuff happen.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Interesting,\" said Thor, tilting his head slightly. \"I would like to see some of this magic.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I can't really do any on my own,\" said Xander. \"Some people can, the rest of us need the rituals and stuff to help.\" He tried to avoid it these days anyway.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What do you need?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I, uh, I'd need a spell book first, so I'd know what to do. Then probably lizard guts or something,\" said Xander, not quite sure how to answer. He also had sneaking suspicion that he needed to be on Earth unless he was someone like Willow who had a heapful of innate power.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Next time you're on Earth, Thor, we'll see about getting you a demo,\" Jack came to his rescue. \"If you have time now . . .?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No. I am afraid I do not have much time to spare. I have already stayed too long.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We owe you,\" said Jack solemnly as he stood.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I have lost track,\" said Thor. He turned to Xander. \"It was an honor to meet the child of the great O'Neill.\"</p>\n\
    <p>'The great O'Neill?' Xander glanced questioningly at his father who just grinned and shrugged again then nodded to Thor. \"Thanks for having me and showing me around.\" Andrew was never going to believe this . . . unless . . . \"Do you have a pen?\" he asked Daniel who blinked in surprise before patting his pockets and coming up with a Sharpie. Xander accepted it while hitting his own pockets for something to write on, but he didn't have anything. \"Could you, uh . . . sign my sleeve?\" he offered the pen and his covered arm to the small alien, vaguely embarrassed for asking but knowing that he'd regret it if he didn't. He refused to look at Jack who he heard mutter \"For crying out loud!\" and Daniel who he was pretty sure was snickering.</p>\n\
    <p>Thor, while his expression didn't really change, was obviously confused, but he got the idea when Xander told him to write, 'To Xander, friend of the Asguard, Supreme Commander Thor,' in alien symbols on his shirt.</p>\n\
    <p>\"A peculiar custom,\" said Thor as he handed back the pen.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's a reminder that we met,\" said Xander. \"You know, in case anyone doesn't believe me.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah.\" Thor nodded. \"Then will you write for me?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked up from admiring his sleeve. \"What?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Will you not write for me?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, sure,\" Xander grinned.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey! How come he never asked me for an autograph?\" Jack complained quietly in the background while Thor went and retrieved one of the half-egg things from the control panel.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Jack, he named a ship after you,\" said Daniel patiently.</p>\n\
    <p>A whole ship? Xander looked up and wanted to ask but since Thor was handing him the stone, he decided to get it out of him later. 'To Thor, friend of the Watcher's Council of Earth, Xander Harris, Watcher, N.A.'</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thank you,\" Thor seemed to smile as he accepted back the stone, though Xander wasn't quite sure. \"I will now return you to your base.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Another short round of goodbyes and Thor sent them back so quickly that Xander didn't have time to feel it. Instead, he found himself between Jack and Daniel in the middle of the conference room at the SGC where Dr. Weir, Major Davis, and Sam were all waiting for them.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Jack let his mind wander over appropriate gifts for a twenty-something witch during the briefing that was taking much longer than necessary. For once his post-mission \xE2\x80\x93 or he should say post-revival \xE2\x80\x93 physical had come with a very nice treat. He'd thought it was a conspiracy at first with his teammates and Xander grinning like that, so he'd followed them warily to the observation room, which, Daniel explained, just happened to look over the quarantine infirmary room, where a certain Vice President was being monitored for a sudden case of boils.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack would never forget the look on Kinsey's face when he'd seen Jack grinning down at him. The obscenities and empty threats just bounced of the glass as far as he was concerned, turning the good Vice President purple with rage. There wasn't a thing he could do to Jack from his little room. Ever again. It was deeply satisfying.</p>\n\
    <p>\"How long will the boils last?\" he'd asked Xander over his shoulder.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, there's no going back,\" Xander had said cheerfully. \"Vengeance is forever. He'll probably have an unnaturally long life, too.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack couldn't think of anyone who deserved it more, which was why he was thinking about Daniel's suggestion of getting Willow a present. Unfortunately he had no idea what would be a good gift. He needed to ask Xander, but his son was sitting too far away to slip a note, so he would just have to wait for the briefing to finish.</p>\n\
    <p>They were still going on about the nonsense he'd spouted while still in Ancient mode. Dr. Weir was interested in implications for future defense and of course, Daniel was no help in wrapping things up, and neither was Carter for that matter. Davis, the lucky bastard, had gotten out while the going was good.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack wondered if he could get away with sending Xander a paper airplane note. He could tell his son had no more interest in the briefing than he did. Xander had declared straight out that he had no idea what the phrase meant. But he had put on his guileless face, the one that suggested he wasn't anymore than a simple man that left all the heavy thinking to others. Jack had a feeling that Xander had a very good idea what 'one world, one life, one source,' meant, and he wasn't sharing. He wondered if he should call him on it, but since Weir wasn't cleared for the supernatural, he decided to get it out of him later.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander only spoke when asked a question and the rest of the time ignored the conversation while he inspected his sleeve where Thor had written his autograph. Jack had no doubt that the first thing Xander would do when he got home was frame it. Jack shook his head just imagining Andrew's speechlessness.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dr. Weir?\" Jack interrupted, finally having enough. \"Can't all this be summed up in a report?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Weir regarded him a moment as a small smile eeked across her face. \"Impatient to go home?\" she asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"When you put it like that . . .\" Jack noticed Xander's head come up at the new direction in conversation.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Very well, Director Harris, if you have nothing to add?\" Xander shook his head quickly, \"Then the formal briefing is dismissed. Dr. Jackson, Major Carter, you're welcome to stay.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thank you.\" Jack rose to his feet, Xander and Teal'c doing the same. Happy to escape they made for the doors and as they did, Weir called out,</p>\n\
    <p>\"Enjoy your visit!\"</p>\n\
    <p>Surprisingly, it was Xander who turned and nodded. Once they were out the door, Jack asked, \"What was that all about?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked at him then quickly away, taking two more steps before he answered. \"I told her you were my dad.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Teal'c almost ran into Jack, he stopped so fast. He didn't know if it was the fact that Xander had told her or that he'd actually used 'my' and 'dad' in the same sentence. \"You did?\" he said stupidly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You told Thor,\" Xander defended himself. \"Besides it's not like it's a dirty secret or anything.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No. No, it's not.\" Jack grinned. He couldn't believe it. He just . . . it topped seeing Kinsey miserable. 'My dad.' He hadn't heard those words said like that since Charlie. He'd wondered if he ever would again, even once Xander had come into his life. And now he had.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>Xander noticed that Jack's smile didn't fade on the way to the VIP quarters to grab his stuff or on the elevator ride to the surface. Jack had tried to keep it cool with light questions about Chinese takeout and whatnot, but his underlying happiness was hard for even him to keep in.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander just played along. The briefing had given him a lot of time to think, and after the initial reminders to himself to call Giles and see what could be done about getting control of the thing that had caused the magic drain, his thoughts had turned back to Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>His dad. He still didn't know why he had told Dr. Weir. He still didn't know why he felt weird about telling her. As he'd told Jack later, it <i>wasn't</i> a secret, but at the same time it felt like it was, something only to share with close friends. Family.</p>\n\
    <p>Family. It had made him smile. For Xander, family were the people you went to to get away from your relatives.</p>\n\
    <p>Most of his relatives were gone now. None of them had tried to find him after Sunnydale, or if they had, he'd never known about it. And he didn't really mind. He hadn't been their grandson or nephew or cousin for a long time. Or son.</p>\n\
    <p>But he was Jack's, and more than that, he wanted to be. And despite the universe conspiring against them, he was going to be for a long time.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So is that a normal week for you?\" he asked Jack after they had passed the last checkpoint.</p>\n\
    <p>\"More or less,\" said Jack. \"We actually don't get attacked by Goa'uld in ships that often. And Thor doesn't stop by that often either.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But the whole nearly dying because of alien crap in your head?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack shrugged. \"It's part of the job. Would the danger make you stop what you do?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, I get it,\" said Xander. \"Don't think I really did before.\" He really hadn't. Aliens had been abstract and Jack dying . . . he hadn't let himself think about that until he'd actually seen him. \"Thor's cool though,\" he said to get off that train of thought.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I can't believe you asked for his autograph,\" Jack shook his head. \"And I can't believe he asked for yours.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, I am the child of the <i>great</i> O'Neill,\" Xander glanced at him sideways.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thor likes me,\" said Jack smugly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did he really name a ship after you?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Cool.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Carter blew it up though.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"'Blew up' as in 'kablewie'?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Long story.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"That sucks.\" Xander grinned at a sudden thought. \"Don't tell Andrew that part.\"</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>They stopped for Chinese takeout on the way home which had led to an ardent discussion of what was good and what was not. Cashew Chicken turned out to be the only thing they could agree on so they each ended up with a couple cartons of their own, which suited Jack just fine since that meant more of the good stuff for him.</p>\n\
    <p>Once they were back at the house, Jack headed immediately to the kitchen for two bottles of beer and a couple of forks. In the den, Xander had thrown his jacket in the armchair and settled down on the couch, pushing magazines around on the coffee table looking for the remote control.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Here,\" Jack handed him a beer and a fork which Xander accepted absently as he clicked on the TV. Jack sat next to him, fishing his Beef with Broccoli out of the bag along with his share of the egg rolls.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Any channel requests?\" asked Xander, one-handedly grabbing the rice and his Spicy Mongolian Beef.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Twenty-five,\" said Jack sitting back. Xander switched it to ESPN.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I should have guessed,\" he said, sitting back himself and plopping his feet on the coffee table.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Shoes!\" Jack elbowed him. Xander kicked his shoes over the opposite edge where they fell to the floor in two thunks.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So what're we looking at? Death toll?\" he asked.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Scores,\" Jack ignored the sarcasm with the ease that came from putting up with Daniel. The past week had been the last of the NHL regular season. As he read the ticker tape summary of the day's games he noted that there had been no major upsets.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I can't believe you watch this every week,\" said Xander. \"It's so boring.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You watch sci-fi,\" Jack replied. \"That's just plain bad.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You just don't like it 'cause you shoot aliens for a living. Face it, you might've liked it otherwise.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack tore his eyes away from the screen long enough to say, \"I didn't watch Star Wars till Teal'c rented it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander shrugged. \"I didn't watch Interview With a Vampire until after I met Buffy. And let me tell you, that movie was crap. Vampires are nothing like that.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What about artistic license?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did you like <i>Star Wars</i>?\" Xander asked pointedly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, it was all right,\" Jack admitted. \"It's just a movie. Have you seen the show <i>Wormhole X-treme</i>?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"The one that came out a couple years ago? Once or twice. Andrew doesn't even like it much.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Where do you think they got the idea for it?\" Jack asked. That got Xander's attention and stopped his fork halfway from his mouth.</p>\n\
    <p>\"It's based on you? The Stargate thing? No way!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I can't <i>say </i>anything, but loosely,\" Jack nodded.</p>\n\
    <p>\"<i>Wormhole X-treme</i>?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I said loosely,\" Jack reiterated. He'd been on set and seen part of an episode himself so he knew it was bad. But Xander was laughing now. \"And don't tell Andrew,\" he ordered because he knew that his next visit would be hell if the ultimate nerd ever found out.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No telling Andrew, got it,\" Xander said between snickers. \"Until I want something . . . Colonel Ace Danning!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh, for crying out loud!\" Hearing hte name of the character based on him, Jack knew he shouldn't have told him. But his outburst only made Xander laugh harder. Jack tried to ignore him and focus on what the anchor was saying about playoffs while he ate his dinner, relieved when Xander finally started to calm down.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Does Thor come over for guest appearances?\" Xander lost it again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just you wait until there's a TV character based on you,\" Jack grumbled. In need of something more distracting he reached for the remote by Xander's knee. \"And if you kick over the food, you're cleaning it up,\" he told him.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I won't kick anything over,\" Xander protested, nevertheless stilling his twitching limbs. \"Hey, flip to the Cartoon Network.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack obliged, but only after going through ESPN2, CNN, and the local channels first. There was nothing on except the <i>PowerPuff Girls </i>and Jack let the episode wash over him, content to sit and eat, drink, and relax. Beside him, Xander chuckled at the cartoon, at home on the couch. He finally seemed to have let the Wormhole X-treme thing go, but then he would glance at Jack and snicker. Jack pretended to glare at him which only made Xander laugh harder until Jack felt a contagious grin pull at his own lips. Shaking his head, Jack settled into the show, content to sit a watch and laugh with the young man by his side. It felt good and right in a way that Jack had almost forgotten.</p>\n\
    <p>By the end of two episodes, they had finished eating for the most part. Jack gathered together the empty cartons and bottles as the credits rolled, trying to get them together so he only had to make one trip to the trash. Xander helped put things in his hands, his earlier jovial expression giving way to something more serious. He seemed to want to say something, and Jack didn't think it was the \"thanks\" he got. Not worrying about it, Jack took his load to the kitchen.</p>\n\
    <p>He was just reaching to get to the recycle bin for the bottles when Xander called out, \"Hey, Dad, can you grab some napkins?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack stopped. Turned. Looked through to the living room. \"What?\" It came out shaky. But Xander had just called him . . .</p>\n\
    <p>\"Napkins,\" Xander repeated, staring him back straight in the eye. And Jack knew that Xander knew exactly what he had just said. And that he knew what Jack was really asking. When Jack didn't move right away, he added, \"Like the nickname? 'Cause it's either that or 'Ace' . . .\" his son grinned sheepishly, looking down and away then back, uncertain and almost afraid but at the same time defiant.</p>\n\
    <p>\"No, 'Dad' is fine,\" said Jack a smile breaking out across his own face even as he felt like the sun was rising in his chest and he wasn't big enough to hold in all the love and pride he felt for Xander at that moment.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good,\" said Xander, breaking out into a relived smile. \"Napkins.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right, napkins,\" Jack shook away his shock and grabbed some napkins before rejoining his son in the den.</p>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <hr>\n\
    <p>AN: in regard to Ace Danning, I made up the first name as none was given.</p>"

    <p>AN: I know I said I would  have this up by Sept 4 but I didn't get to it and then of course I was  without computer for three weeks and then school started so I've been  just a tad busy (and yes that was sarcasm. I'm jealous of all you  people who seem to have time to write.)</p>\n\
    <p>I am also pleased to  announce that Bridges won Best Unfinished in the Stargate category at  The Crossover Awards and was runner up in both Best TV Crossover and  Best Post-Series categories at the SunnyD awards. It still amazes me  that it won anything at all. I have also been nominated at the White  Knight Awards and the Shades of Grey Awards along with some other  excellent people from TTH. I'd like to thank all my readers for their  endless support during the writing of this story (8 months!); it really  means a lot.</p>\n\
    <p>Now onward.</p>\n\
    <hr>Sixteen Happier Endings<hr>It  was like watching chickens run around with their heads cut off, Jack  decided. From his perch by the coffee maker and the toaster, he had a  prime seat to watch the chaos that he'd come to associate with  Cleveland. Since early this morning it'd been one thing after another,  plans made and changed as people got up \xE2\x80\x93 the arduous task of getting  people up \xE2\x80\x93 and now rushing to eat and get dressed before having to run  out the door.<p>\"Dawn! You're gonna be late!\" Buffy shouted up the  stairs at the off beat thumping that thundered down the upstairs  hallway and down the stairs.</p>\n\
    <p>\"There's goo on my shoes!\" Dawn's strong voice echoed through the house.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So not my fault,\" said Buffy. \"Ask Vi. Did you eat breakfast?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Dawn's reply was lost to Jack in Andrew's shouted, \"XANDER? Can we afford twenty pounds of flour?\" from the pantry.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Make  it ten!\" Xander called, coming into the kitchen from the dining room  with a handful of papers, a pencil tucked behind an ear. \"Buffy!\" he  said as the two sisters joined them still arguing over the rules of  borrowing shoes. \"How long are you gonna be here? And I need to know  when you're coming back for the schedules.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, Dawn's gonna  be late for rehearsal. No rehearsal, no graduation.\" The Slayer grabbed  a package of poptarts and shoved them at her sister. \"Eat,\" she  commanded. Dawn wrinkled her nose but accepted them anyway. Buffy  rounded on Xander. \"And aren't you taking her?\"</p>\n\
    <p>The young man  craned his head to look at the clock on the stove. \"Shit, you're gonna  be late!\" he said. Buffy rolled her eyes to Jack at the fact that she  had just said that. Xander darted back into the dining room to deposit  whatever Slayer Camp stuff he'd been working on, then rushed with Dawn  and Buffy to the front hall. He was back a moment later. \"Dad, have you  seen my keys?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"By the phone,\" Jack told him with a nod in the right direction. A smile played about his lips.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Wait!\" cried Andrew as Xander disappeared again.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Shopping list!\" the resident Iron Chef said as he ran by Jack into the hall.</p>\n\
    <p>\"DIANA!\" Buffy shouted. \"CAR'S LEAVING!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"COMING!\" the slayer's voice replied accompanied by a banging door and running feet. \"I couldn't find my shoes!\"</p>\n\
    <p>The door opened and slammed shut. Quiet. For all of a second.</p>\n\
    <p>\"VI!\"  yelled Buffy as Andrew went back to the pantry. Another  indistinguishable yell, more running and chasing down of shoes before  the two slayers trooped through the kitchen and into the backyard for  their training training. Vi was going to help out teaching this summer  since Buffy would be absent setting up her own school in Rome.</p>\n\
    <p>As  the door clattered shut, the coffee maker announced that it was done,  and Jack gratefully poured himself a cup. Quiet again settled over the  house that in three short days would be invaded by teenagers. He was  very glad that he was going to miss that. The place was crazy enough  under normal circumstances, worse now with Buffy home, Giles coming,  Dawn graduating, and a whole army to prepare for, but for all that,  Jack just couldn't imagine adding sixty girls to the mix. He was here  for a nice \xE2\x80\x93 well, he wouldn't exactly call it quiet \xE2\x80\x93 vacation before  heading back into the shakeup going on at the Mountain. And he had to  say, Cleveland was just as good a vacation spot as the cabin in  Minnesota.</p>\n\
    <p>True, there weren't any fish, and it was noisy at odd  hours of the day, but Xander and the girls he had come to know and the  absolute absurdity of youth more than made up for it. Secretly though,  Jack was looking forward to Giles's arrival for another aged adult to  commiserate with.</p>\n\
    <p>Turning to the window, he watched Buffy and Vi  practicing martial arts forms in the back yard. It wasn't one he  recognized, looked like a mixture of a few different styles blended  with a grace that Jack envied. He was tempted to join them, but the  thought of embarrassing himself kept him where he was. He didn't want  to cramp their style or anything. Stepping away from the window, he  shook his head at himself. And he thought Daniel made him feel old  sometimes. So Jack did the next best thing and went out to sit on the  back porch, settling his coffee on the arm of his chair. Both Buffy and  Vi's eyes flickered to him, the latter flashing him a smile, never once  interrupting the smooth flow of their bodies.</p>\n\
    <p>He'd never imagined  that he'd be gaining more than a just a son when he'd flown out her  almost a year before. Like with Cassie, he was now almost an uncle to  the other four permanent residents of the house, especially since  Xander had come to the mountain. The girls had chatted a little more on  the phone over the last two months, and Andrew had positively grilled  him on Thor. Xander and his big mouth. And framed shirt. It hung in  their room on the wall opposite the door by the window so it was the  first thing you saw when you walked in, the autographed sleeve artfully  folded over the chest like a left handed ghost pledging allegiance. It  was anything but subtle. But then, he thought as he watched the two  young women who exuded lethal power like a second skin, little around  here was.</p>\n\
    <p>Buffy and Vi's warm up wound to a close and after a few  quiet words that Jack couldn't hear they launched into another pattern  faster than the first that added in kicks and spins. They were twin  blurs of motion, two fighters in a synchronized dance. It was like a  scene from a movie against the backdrop of the summer green of the  backyard with the morning sunlight streaming through the clouds. The  same sunlight that felt warm and drowsy on Jack's skin, despite the  half drunk coffee. Content, he drifted into sleep.</p>\n\
    <hr>Xander  and Diana returned home a few hours later laden with supplies. As the  younger and stronger of the two, Diana was stuck with most of the bags  hanging off her arms like she'd sprouted wings while Xander cheerfully  ignored her grumbling.<p>\"I mean, why can't they help when they get  here?\" she was saying as they walked up to the house. \"It's not like we  didn't just finish school either. And we've been active all year, too.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Using the barracks as a giant storage closet,\" Xander replied over his shoulder. He opened the door and kicked it wide open.</p>\n\
    <p>\"But we've already cleared most of it out!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Andrew  and I've already cleared most of it out. Besides you get today off to  train,\" he led the way into the kitchen, dropping his bags by the  pantry door. \"Honey, we're home!\" he announced as Andrew emerged. \"I've  marked the things we couldn't find,\" he said handing him the crumpled  shopping list.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Joy. With Buffy,\" Diana muttered as she set her  bags down, turning to the window as she did. But Xander didn't miss the  slight bounce on her heels that belied anything that came out of her  mouth.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Diana, go get beat up,\" he told her, a fond smile  emerging as she started to protest. \"Training day, remember? Just send  Jack in to help me with the rest of this.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine,\" Diana said  with a put upon sigh, a grin nonetheless quirking as she reached the  door. Xander just shook his head at her and started to put the more  immediate things away while he waited for his dad.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Whoa,  successful trip.\" Jack came in and set his mug on the counter. \"You  have enough here to feed an army \xE2\x80\x93 oh, wait, you are.\" He grabbed one  of the nearby bags and started unloading it. \"Jesus, how much chocolate  did you get?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Um, army of girls?\" Xander said, looking up. \"C'mon. This is just the small stuff. We gotta get the bulkness out of the car.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I guess this is about as manly a job as we'll get around here,\" said Jack making Xander smile as they went back out front.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We're only stronger when they don't want to do it,\" said Xander philosophically.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack snorted. \"Next time I need some Marines straightened out, I'm sending them here,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Only if they pay tuition,\" Xander replied, flashing back to the Initiative and the damage one slayer had done to their ranks.</p>\n\
    <p>\"We'll write it off as additional Special Forces training,\" said Jack. \"Uncle Sam will foot the bill.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good,  cause we already can't afford to let the girls come for free,\" said  Xander. He still had no idea how they were going to make it through the  summer. Giles's rumblings had been a little hopeful lately but as of  the last time they'd discussed it, it was all still smoke and mirrors.  Xander was still working at Home Depot, but he didn't know how long he  could keep that up once the junior slayers rolled in on Monday.</p>\n\
    <p>Monday.  It was still too soon for him. Xander felt like he'd been planning for  the last month and still there were a million things left to do.  Thoughts of schedules and patrol groups flitted through his mind as he  opened the trunk and started loading a couple cases of snack food onto  Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, you want to do a guest lecture for me?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Lecture? On what?\" asked Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Dunno,\"  said Xander, hefting two cases of Ramen for himself. \"Whatever you  want. Leadership or modern weapons or men or something.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander,\" Jack paused to look at him over the top of the Ritz crackers. \"I'm not giving the sex talk.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander  laughed at the thought of the grizzled old Colonel giving a bunch of  girls The Talk. \"Don't worry. Those that haven't heard it learn all  about it after a couple of weeks at the giant slumber party.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I really didn't need to know that,\" said Jack, resuming their walk to the house.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Trust me, it's scary. They all start looking at you funny, and I mean 'love spell' funny. So not a good time.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm to even going to ask.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So you'll do a lecture?\" Xander changed the subject.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sure.\"  They reached the kitchen and dropped the cases to the floor. \"As long  as I'm not, you know, saving the world or anything,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>Xander grinned at him as they headed back out. \"I'm sure you can get Thor to cover for you,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You know, the whole lecture thing is really more Carter of Daniel's thing than mine.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Right,  and when I want a lecture about something useless I'll let them know,\"  said Xander. He already had Giles and Dawn for those things as  applicable to killing things anyway. \"Besides,\" he went on coming to a  stop by the car and facing Jack, \"I'm not going to be able to get out  to Colorado for a while.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ahh!\" Jack lifted a warning finger. \"No guilt carding. That's not fair.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, if you're going to come visit anyway . . .\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Didn't I already say I would do it?\" He slid the next case toward them and picked it up.</p>\n\
    <p>\"And  then you did a one-eighty retracty dealio with all the not-me-thing  talk about your friends,\" said Xander as he grabbed a case of his own.  When he stood up, Jack was looking at him exasperatedly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did not,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did too!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did not. I said I'd do it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"And then you tried to weasel out of it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I did not!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Did too!\" Xander pushed the ajar door open again. He couldn't believe Jack. \"You were trying to foist it off on Daniel.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"'Foist?'\"  Jack gave him a look. \"There was nothing foisty about it. All I said  was that I'm not a lecture person. I never said I wouldn't do it. In  fact, I think I already said yes. Twice.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh no. That was total foistiness. Doesn't matter what you said.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, would you knock it off already? I said I'd do it, I'll do it.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander  set his case down next to the others in the kitchen and watched as Jack  did the same. \"What?\" asked his dad as he straightened. His dad. Xander  couldn't help but grin.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You got something on your nose.\" He half  gestured at the guilty fleck of cardboard. Jack went cross-eyed as he  took several swipes to get it off, wriggling his nose like a chipmunk.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Thanks.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No problem. Wouldn't want you walking in public looking like a loser who can't see the end of his nose.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah, but I can see past it,\" Jack pointed out.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just make sure you keep it clean.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Me? Always.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked over his shoulder as they went back out. \"Yeah, I think your nose just grew three feet.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Jack  sputtered in protest and the banter back and forth continued on for the  next two loads out of the car and on the trip to pick up Dawn from  rehearsal where it had progressed to a criticism of driving styles. But  hey, Xander couldn't help it if he had one eye, and besides, his dad  drove worse with two. By the time they headed out to the airport to  pick up Giles, Dawn had threatened to rustle up some herbs for a  silencing spell. Xander and Jack had of course then teamed up against  her.</p>\n\
    <p>In the busy bustle of the baggage claim, Dawn was the first  to spot the returning Watcher. \"Giles!\" she practically squealed like a  little kid as she ran and wrapped him in a bear hug. \"They're picking  on me!\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"What? Hello.\" Giles blinked from Xander to Jack  wondering what was going on which only made Xander laugh before he  claimed his own hug.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Giles.\" Jack and Giles shook hands.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel  O'Neill. Wonderful to see you alive and well.\" And the G-man smiled  warmly in a way that Xander still found both surprising and heartening.  It was like the two parts of his life were coming together at last.  \"Now what was this about picking?\" Giles turned to Xander who held up  his hands in their defense.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, me and Dad weren't picking and did you know that Dawn went and grew up and learned some naughty words?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander!  You're just mad 'cause you didn't know what some of them meant.\" Dawn  crossed her arms and arched a triumphant eyebrow. Xander scowled \xE2\x80\x93 of  course he didn't know what they meant; they were in some ancient  language but he bet at least one meant 'farthead'.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Ah, yes,\"  Giles's face cleared at their bickering. \"That would have been when we  were fighting the forces of evil. I take it everything is under control  for tonight?\" The luggage carrousel turned on with a groan so they  moseyed over and edged their way to its side.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, Buffy, Vi,  and Di went on a rampage last night,\" said Dawn. \"And I made Buffy  promise not to destroy the school, but we haven't had any inklings  since Jack went fudgesicle.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey, who you calling a 'fudgesicle'?\" Jack turned from watching the carrousel.</p>\n\
    <p>Dawn went wide-eyed and blushed. \"Maybe I should have kept that thought in my head.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh  God, not you too!\" Xander groaned. Because, from his long association  with Willow and Buffy, he knew exactly where that thought had come  from. \"Therapy. Need therapy.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, yes, quite,\" stuttered Giles,  his glasses off and his eyes closed. Jack meanwhile was very carefully  not looking at Dawn who was still bright red but beginning to be  defiant about it.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'll, uh, take that as a compliment,\" Jack managed to say.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Oh,  look my bag!\" Giles said a little too loudly. He shuffled forward and  snagged a suitcase that was big and brown but apparently one of a kind.  Once he had it, they began the journey back to the car. Conversation  again turned to the little visit the slayers had paid a few of the  seedier demon haunts to ensure that nothing would be going down  tonight. Buffy's visit as the Slayer-that-had-destroyed-the  Sunnydale-hellmouth was enough to keep the underworld gossiping for  months.</p>\n\
    <p>As they entered the parking garage, Giles and Dawn  branched off into researchy things while Xander and Jack started  arguing over who got to drive. Xander told his dad that he drove like a  werewolf on crack. Jack told Xander that he had a fender bender with  every car in front of them.</p>\n\
    <p>Annoyed when they came to a halt by  the car, still arguing, Giles said, \"Xander, do shut up and give Dawn  the keys. You're making a nuisance of yourself.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Me?\" Xander immediately took offence.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes, well, I imagine threatening to take away Jack's next paycheck would do me little good. Yours, on the other hand \xE2\x80\x93\"</p>\n\
    <p>But  Xander needed to back up a sec. \"Paycheck?\" he asked, just to be sure.  And that was a smile on the G-man's face. Xander almost couldn't  believe it. Money, money, money! There would be food and he could quit  his sucky job and buy equipment and first aid and \xE2\x80\x93 his mind rambled on  over the possibilities.</p>\n\
    <p>\"You got the money?\" said Dawn equally surprised.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I did,\" said Giles smugly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Woo and hoo!\" And Xander, suddenly flooded with joy and relief, threw the keys to Dawn.</p>\n\
    <hr>Dinner  that evening was chaotic at best. Dawn had to be at the high school gym  earlier than everyone else and the younger slayers were running a quick  sweep of the area before the guests arrived. At the house Andrew was so  excited about the new funds that he immediately started on a new supply  list while Buffy, Xander, and Giles got caught up and talked shop. And  somehow, Jack had gotten dragged into the conversation. One minute he'd  been sneaking off to go watch TV, the next he was answering questions  about Basic Training and how to integrate new troops into existing  units.<p>Buffy was adamant that there would be no 'maggot yelling' as  she called it while Xander wanted to make sure that girls who were  together last summer got split up this year, and Giles wanted solo  patrols at least once a week for the older girls. It was rather  interesting to see how their definition of training clashed with that  of the Air Force.</p>\n\
    <p>Around six-thirty, Vi and Diana returned,  breaking up the discussion so everyone had time to get ready. The  ceremony was at eight, but Jack refrained from commenting when Xander  and Giles took it in stride. In fact, Xander rushed off himself to snag  a shower before all the hot water ran out.</p>\n\
    <p>\"If you don't go now,  you'll have to wait till the last minute to get cleaned up,\" Giles  warned him when it was just the two of them in the dining room.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Nah,  I'm good,\" Jack waved a hand. All he needed to do was change his shirt  and throw on his leather jacket, a tactic that he noticed Giles seemed  to be using as well. Feeling eyes on him, Giles looked up from the  notes he was gathering together, and Jack smiled.</p>\n\
    <p>\"I'm glad you came,\" Giles broke the silence before it became awkward. \"It means a lot to Xander.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Now  Jack did feel awkward and he grabbed a loose pen. \"It seemed like a  good time to visit, before teenage hell broke loose anyway,\" he said.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Colonel.  Jack,\" said Giles, the use of his first name grabbing the other man's  attention. \"Don't pass it off for what it isn't. Xander deserves better  and so do you.\" Giles's eyes gentled and he added, \"He talks about you  a lot, did you know?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"No,\" said Jack, startled by this from the  man that had threatened to kill him once already. He hadn't realized  that Giles didn't mind him anymore. Or liked him, for that matter,  beyond what politeness required.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He does. Indirectly for the  most part, but you're always there,\" said Giles. \"I don't know how much  he's told you about his childhood \xE2\x80\x93 I don't know much about it myself  except for the little things that came out over the years \xE2\x80\x93 but it was  difficult, vampires and demons not withstanding.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"He seemed to come out of it pretty well,\" said Jack softly.</p>\n\
    <p>Giles  smiled again. \"Yes, he has. I've often thought his discovering the  supernatural was one of the best things that happened to him as bad as  it can be. But honestly, I think your discovery of him was the best.\"  The other man's eyes held Jack's a moment longer then let them go.  Gathering his notes, Giles rose and went into the kitchen leaving Jack  still surprised at the dining room table.</p>\n\
    <p>Who'd have thought that  Xander talked about him to Giles of all people? And that Giles was  happy about it? And that Giles would tell him? And that he was happy  Jack was in his son's life?</p>\n\
    <p>When Jack moved to the den to watch TV until it was time to go, he was still grinning.</p>\n\
    <hr>The  pounding on the door woke Xander late the next morning. He groaned and  rolled over, pulling his pillow over his head. Way too early. Way, way  too early. The impromptu graduation party last night that they'd thrown  after Dawn and the younger girls had gotten back from the official  party had lasted well into the early morning. Mostly it had involved  wine and video games with a smattering of intelligent conversation. It  had been a good time and for the life of him, he couldn't remember much  of it. And would the banging on the door stop?!<p>\"Xander, get your lazy ass out of bed!\" His dad yelled through the door.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Go 'way. 'M still 'sleep!\" he replied. Jack just opened the door, came in, and yanked off his blankets.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Up, up, up! Come on,\" he said when Xander half scrambled to get them back. Sighing in defeat, Xander sat up.</p>\n\
    <p>\"All right, all right, I'm up. What do you want that couldn't wait till, say, sanity rise?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Cute,\" Jack told him. \"But come on, we're going out.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"We are?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yes,  so get some clothes on \xE2\x80\x93 unless you want to go out like that,\" his dad  waved a hand at the boxer and t-shirt ensemble. \"We're leaving in five  minutes. Coffee's in the kitchen.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander made it down the stairs  ten minutes later. Jack pointedly looked at his watch and sighed but  otherwise didn't say anything about it. \"I get to drive,\" he said  instead.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Where are we going?\" asked Xander. He grabbed the Snoopy mug and poured himself a dose of wake-up juice.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Surprise.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You  know, I don't do so well with surprises,\" Xander felt obliged to point  out. Living on hellmouths tended to do that to a person.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Tough,\"  Jack threw him a smile. \"Let's go, kiddo.\" Grumbling, Xander followed  him to the car, but Jack only ignored him and started whistling  cheerfully. Xander tried to bore holes in the back of his head, but it  wasn't working, and by the time they got to the car, Jack's song  actually had him resenting the whole situation less. He contented  himself with asking 'are we there yet' at every intersection until Jack  told him to shut up or expect to walk home. His dad maintained his  serious expression for all of two seconds before they both started  laughing. Getting up was definitely worth it.</p>\n\
    <p>Finally, they  pulled into a parking lot at the strip mall at the opposite end from  Home Depot, and Xander cast a glance at the sign before them. \"Uh, Dad,  you know this is a pet store right?\" Xander glanced at the older man as  he shut off the engine.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yep,\" Jack grinned. \"Come on, you wanted a dog.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I did?\" News to Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah, remember when we first met?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Stepping  out of the car and onto the sidewalk, Xander tried to cast his mind  back. \"I wanted a car,\" he recalled with a quick look at his dad.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well,  you're getting a dog,\" said Jack. He looked very pleased with himself  about the idea, and Xander almost felt bad when he kept arguing.</p>\n\
    <p>\"But they pee on the floor and chew up shoes and eat lamp shades.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Sure  they do, they're puppies,\" Jack opened the door and a little electronic  ding-dong sounded through the shop. The smell of seed and straw  permeated the room along with the chatter of birds and kittens and  puppies. A quick glance at the fish reassured him that they at least  weren't talking in anything more than bubbles. From behind the counter,  the shopkeeper smiled, and Jack waved back before leading the way to  the dogs.</p>\n\
    <p>\"So why would I want one if they're so high  maintenance? I mean, I've got sixty girls coming on Monday. I don't  need another thing to take care of.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Xander, dogs are easy  compared to girls. Besides, every kid needs a dog.\" Jack pronounced the  words like a proverb \xE2\x80\x93 one that Xander wasn't sure he got.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Uh, not much of a kid anymore,\" he pointed out.</p>\n\
    <p>Jack turned and looked at him. \"You're still my kid,\" he said. \"Now take a look.\"</p>\n\
    <p>Grinning,  Xander turned his attention to the wriggling puppies in the big playpen  box, wondering how he'd gotten here to this point. It still felt  strange when his dad said things like that, but it also sent a thrill  through him that felt good and right. Belonging.</p>\n\
    <p>And he had to  admit, the puppies were cute. There were about ten of them \xE2\x80\x93 they kept  moving when he counted \xE2\x80\x93 and all sorts of colors. Two black, one black  and brown, one kinda dishwater, a couple gray, but the one that caught  Xander's eye was the mottled black and gray with one black patch of fur  over its right eye.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Hey look, me and this guy make a full set,\" he pointed the puppy out to Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"He's cute. That the one you want?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Xander looked up. \"You're still serious about this?\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"You betcha. Is that a 'yes'?\"</p>\n\
    <p>Still not quite believing that his dad was getting him a dog, Xander nodded.</p>\n\
    <p>Half  an hour, several forms, and a check to see if it was a boy or girl, and  Xander was the new owner of the little, male, black and gray dog.  They'd have to come back the next day to pick him up after the vet had  neutered him, but Xander still felt kind of giddy about the idea. He'd  never had a pet before. Willow and Jesse hadn't either beyond Will's  fish, so this was new and exciting territory. Even if he couldn't  remember ever asking for one. It had been a year after all.</p>\n\
    <p>And that thought brought him up short as the two of them got back in the car. \"It's been a year,\" he said, half to himself.</p>\n\
    <p>\"What's that?\" asked Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"A year. Since you showed up.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\"  Jack agreed. He pulled out and onto the road, thinking. \"Been a long  year. For a while there I didn't think we'd make it,\" he added softly.</p>\n\
    <p>\"The  universe did try to munchmeat us,\" said Xander, thinking back over the  demons and chaos and mini apocalypses and even Jack's alien attack that  nearly ended the world. Their family problems and trust issues had  seemed so much bigger in some ways and so much smaller and ridiculous  in others.</p>\n\
    <p>\"She always does. But she also works in mysterious ways,\" said his dad with a pointed look and a smile.</p>\n\
    <p>\"'She'?\" asked Xander. \"Sounds like you're dangerously close to believing in something.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"I don't believe in gods, you don't believe in religion,\" Jack shrugged. \"We both believe in magic.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"But not fairy tale endings.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just happier ones.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"So does this count?\" asked Xander.</p>\n\
    <p>\"Well, it would,\" his dad looked over, a grin playing around his lips, \"except it's not an ending.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Good,\"  Xander smiled too, feeling warm and right and happy. \"'Cause when I  have puppy problems, you're the first person I'm calling.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Fine, but you only get one middle-of-the-night call,\" said Jack.</p>\n\
    <p>\"One? And what do you mean 'middle-of-the-night'? You never said anything about middle-of-the-night.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Don't worry about it, you'll be up anyway. And it's only at the beginning.\"</p>\n\
    <p>\"Just how long is this 'beginning'?\"</p>\n\
    <p>And they spoke of puppies and middle-of-the-night phone calls and beginnings all the way home.</p>\n\
    <hr>the bridge complete<hr>\n\
    <p>Now before you all get excited, yes that is the end of Bridges. Finito.  Complete. (Oh my god I just finished! (:Realization is sinking in.:) At  this point there is no sequel planned. I might come back to play in the  Bridges universe at a future time but as I have none anymore (time that  is), don't expect to see anything for a good long while (i.e. months).</p>\n\
    <p>Thank you for reading and hopefully enjoying my story. It's for you I write.</p>\n\

    Section 27: Snakehead<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>D'argo screamed. He choked it off as best he could but the pain in the tonka that covered his neck was almost unbearable. The sensitive appendage burned like white-hot fire, worse than any torture he'd ever endured. And through it he could feel something moving, scrabbling at his neck as it wriggled through the hole it had made. Frantically, D'argo grabbed at the worm, trying to stop it from clawing open his head. It was persistent but unmotivated by a pain so great that D'argo fought the black spots from taking his consciousness. He could feel blood dripping down his back. And the thing still clawed at him.</p>
    <p>D'argo didn't think. He only felt fire and teeth, his arms trying to extract the creature stuck halfway through his tonka, and the growing weakness in his muscles as the toxins released when his coagulated blood hit the air recirculated into his body. He didn't think about how long he had until his body gave out, or what would happen if the creature entered his head. It hurt too much, like live current rushing through him. He barely realized it when his legs gave way and he crashed to the ground. Or when driven by instinct he started to bang his head against the ground to stimulate the blood flow so it wouldn't poison him. It wasn't long until he knocked himself unconscious. At the back of his neck, a blue tail wiggled.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Jack looked at his watch. A mere minute had passed since the last time he had looked. "It's been three hours," he murmured to Teal'c who sat beside him near the door. "We should have heard something by now."</p>
    <p>"The Goa'uld can be very patient, O'Neill," Teal'c replied. "And we have no other choice but to wait. As distasteful as it is."</p>
    <p>"I just wish we knew what was happening with D'argo. I mean, it's not like the snakeheads to not brag about it."</p>
    <p>"But he is of an unknown race," said Teal'c. "Her usual methods of torture may not be as effective, though John Crichton did indicate that he would not be immune to them. She may be healing him in the sarcophagus."</p>
    <p>"Gaaa," Jack sighed, tilting his head back against the wall. "What is it with them and those damn sarcophaguses?"</p>
    <p>"They are the Goa'uld, O'Neill," Teal'c simply said with a sideways look at his friend. Jack closed his eyes. It summed them up pretty well. All he wanted right now was to get out of there.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>D'argo woke up with a lurch, a massive migraine competing with the burning pain in his tonka and neck. The gold ceiling above him didn't look right and it took him a few microts to remember that the bright vault belonged to a woman. Slowly and carefully, he sat up, ignoring the pain , and looked around. The woman was dead. He remembered now. Something in his neck trying to get into his head.</p>
    <p>He cautiously raised his hand to the mass of throbbing pain and jerked back when it met unfamiliar flesh. Gingerly he touched it again. It didn't move. Sighing with relief, D'argo explored it more carefully. The thing was stuck in his tonka, the head limply knocking against the bloody patch it had carved into his neck. With evil delight, D'argo blessed both his thick skin and toxic blood. And greatly appreciated the head banging that had finished the job.</p>
    <p>Of course, if he couldn't find a way out without bringing the guards down upon himself, it would have all been for nothing. That was assuming he'd be able to stand. With no other choice but to try, D'argo pulled his feet under him and levered himself up. The pounding in his head doubled and a wave of dizziness swept over him. Gritting his teeth he rode it out, then slowly, painfully, shuffled toward the side door where the girls had disappeared to earlier. One foot in front of the other, that's all it took.</p>
    <p>D'argo thought he was going to fall down again when he finally made it. With a thud he leaned against the wall and glared at the door that had no obvious control to open it. Now what? Part of him knew he had to do something, the other part was too exhausted to either think or care. All he wanted to do was sleep.</p>
    <p>Catching himself before it was too late, D'argo shook off his stupor. No! He had to get out of there. Find the others. With a strangled cry, he banged his fist on the door. Immediately it opened revealing the wide-eyed stares of ten girls too bewildered and scared to move.</p>
    <p>"You!" D'argo barked at the one in front. "You will take me to the prisoners or I will kill you!" The girl jerked her head back and forth and backed away. Growling, D'argo pushed the pain away stalked forward. "Your mistress is dead. I am in charge now," he said low and threatening. "If you do as I say, you will live to see another day. If not . . ." he reached forward to grab her, and she quickly nodded. "You and you," he pointed out two more girls. "Come with us." Too terrified to speak, the girls led him out into the hall.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"What time is it?" asked John. Sam looked at her watch for the zillionth time in so many minutes.</p>
    <p>"Six thirty-three. It's been almost four and a half hours."</p>
    <p>"John . . ." Sam trailed off, worry etched over her features. She didn't know what she was going to say. Offering comfort now seemed like an empty gesture.</p>
    <p>"He could still be alive," said John. Aeryn looked up at him then back at a spot on the floor, her unreadable mask unchanged.</p>
    <p>"Yeah," was all Sam said mustering a smile that wasn't returned. They lapsed back into silence.</p>
    <p>"Hey!" The Colonel sat up suddenly. Both he and Teal'c shuffled quickly to their feet. Sam felt her heart speed up as she too rose. A quick glance at the others found them also watching the door intently.</p>
    <p>Soon it opened. One of Nit's young women stood in the doorway, and behind her was D'argo leaning on two others, stained brown and looking like he'd just fought a mountain lion.</p>
    <p>"D'argo!" Both Aeryn and John rushed forward to their friend with Jack and Teal'c.</p>
    <p>The warrior smiled weakly at them. "Always needing rescuing," he said before passing out on the floor.</p>

    Rory's already in bed when Dean comes up, sprawled on top of the covers with her nose in a book. She looks up when he settles on the edge of the bed, sticks her finger in the book to mark her place while she gives him a quick kiss, then goes back to reading.
    
    Dean rests his hand on Rory's thigh, sliding it up under fabric and savoring the warm smoothness of her skin. "Stealing my shorts again," he remarks, and she <i>hmms</i> in response, wriggling a little against the pressure of his hand without pausing in her reading. He pulls away and strips off his clothes, gyrating theatrically and flinging his pants across the room to try and make her look up. Rory keeps her eyes firmly on the book, but when he rips off his shorts and wiggles his hips right by her face, he's rewarded by the ghost of a smile.
    
    "There's a naked man in your room!" Dean raises his hands in mock horror. "Aren't you going to protect your maidenly honor?"
    
    "That ship has sailed," Rory says wryly. "But I may be moved to strong measures to protect my maidenly reading privileges." Her voice goes high and breathy on the last word as Dean licks a long stripe along her neck, though, and when he slides his hand between her legs she shifts them wider.
    
    Dean rubs his thumb along the crease where her thigh meets her ass, sliding lower and lower till he can feel the heat of her. He holds his hand there, heavy and unmoving, and says regretfully to the room, "Nothing I can do that can compete with a book."
    
    "It's sadly true," Rory says, but she's definitely smiling now, and she hasn't turned a page for at least two minutes.
    
    Dean nibbles gently at her ear and slides his hand a little further, just the tip of his thumb nudging her wetness. When she moans and shifts back into him Dean rolls closer, pressing his cock into the warmth of her leg. He kisses along her spine, grinning against her skin as her breath starts to come faster. He waits until she tenses, about to turn to kiss him, and pulls away.
    
    "Guess I'll just have to amuse myself," he says mournfully.
    
    Rory laughs and bats his hand away from his cock, little hands wrapping around him. Dean barely suppresses his moan when he feels her mouth join them.
    
    Half an hour later, they're both flushed and panting, lying sticky and boneless in a tumble of sheets.
    
    "Jesus Christ," Dean breathes. "Where do you learn these things?"
    
    Rory smirks and kisses him. "I get them out of books."

    Section 28: Escape The Sequel<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"D'argo!" John shouted as his friend crumpled to the ground. One thought clamoring with the sudden rush of adrenaline: brown blood. Brown blood was bad - in fact it topped the list of bad. Brown meant toxins and not blood loss were why the Luxan was out cold. John barely noticed Jack and Teal'c as he and Aeryn crashed to their knees beside them, hands frantically searching for the wound.</p>
    <p>"What is that?" asked Aeryn when they found it at the back of his neck.</p>
    <p>"Damn!" Jack recoiled. A gray-blue snakelike creature had burrowed through the tonka and torn away the skin of D'argo's neck which was still oozing blood. "That's Nit. She tried to take him over. What happened in there?"</p>
    <p>"We don't have time to figure it out," John told him. "Help me roll him over."</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>But Aeryn was already helping him. Ignoring the confused colonel, they got D'argo onto his stomach and with a murmured apology, hit the wound.</p>
    <p>"Hey!" Jack wrenched John's arm away, staring at him in shock. "Just what the hell do you think you're doing?"</p>
    <p>"Saving his life!" John tried to shake his arm away from the Colonel but Jack had a solid grip. On his other side, shielded from Jack and Teal'c, Aeryn took over and left him to the explanations. "Unless we keep his blood flowing clear it'll become toxic and kill him. It's probably what killed that thing in his tentacle."</p>
    <p>"The Goa'uld," said Teal'c as Jack let him go and watched while Aeryn finally got D'argo's circulation working again.</p>
    <p>"He's still out cold," said Aeryn. She glanced around. Daniel had herded the girls into the cell with them while Sam stood guard. "Let's get out of here."</p>
    <p>Teal'c gathered D'argo into his arms, staggering only slightly under his weight. Jack took the lead with Sam followed by Teal'c and Daniel then John and Aeryn running sweep.</p>
    <p>"Where would they keep our weapons?" asked John once they got underway turning down another matching corridor.</p>
    <p>"Forget our weapons," said Jack, glancing over his shoulder. "We cut our losses and get out of here."</p>
    <p>"Whoa!" John stopped short. "There's soldiers running around here. We're not going to make it without our guns. And I'm not leaving Winona here."</p>
    <p>"Winona?" Jack raised his eyebrows questioningly.</p>
    <p>John winced internally. He probably shouldn't have mentioned her name. "My gun. And D'argo needs his Qualta blade so his ship won't kill us," he added.</p>
    <p>"You named your gun?" Jack asked incredulously.</p>
    <p>"Our stuff is probably in one of the store rooms," Daniel intervened. "Most likely one nearby." Jack gave John another speculative glance before nodding decisively.</p>
    <p>"Lead the way, Danny."</p>
    <p>They tried four storerooms before they found their weapons. As Daniel had said, it was reasonably close to their cell. Getting there they had easily dodged the one squad of soldiers that tromped by. By the time they left though, the alarm had gone up.</p>
    <p>"This way!" Jack whispered as they hurried out. They had all of five seconds of peace before everything went to hell. The sound of running metal footsteps was their only warning before a bunch of soldiers rounded the corner. John dove behind the nearest column and opened fire. It was over in a matter of minutes: the soldiers all lay dead or dying on the floor while the recently escaped prisoners ran as fast as they could out of there.</p>
    <p>The fight out was a blur of red energy bolts and machine gun fire. John lost count of the twists and turns and the numbers against them. The noisy soldiers underestimated them at every turn. Nevertheless, they managed to hit Sam in the shoulder, incapacitating her. John helped Teal'c shoulder D'argo so the other man had an arm free to shoot with. But in the end, there were too many. Cornered and tired, Daniel found them an empty room to hole up in.</p>
    <p>"So now what?" John asked lowering D'argo to the floor and collapsing next to him.</p>
    <p>"Any bright ideas?" Jack asked at large. Outside the door the Jaffa were shouting orders back and forth as they searched for them.</p>
    <p>"Explosives?" suggested Aeryn. She leaned against the wall near the door with D'argo's Qualta blade strapped to her back. Grim-faced and grungy, she reminded John of when they had first met. And then she smiled at him. "Worked last time."</p>
    <p>"We have enough to do a little damage, but we'd still be overwhelmed," Sam shook her head. "Otherwise we'd have to get to the generators, and seeing as we're trapped here. . ."</p>
    <p>"Well, you know what they say, 'if you can't beat 'em, join 'em,'" said John.</p>
    <p>"Join 'em?" asked Daniel confused.</p>
    <p>"That never works, John," Aeryn scowled.</p>
    <p>"Sure it does."</p>
    <p>"Until it backfires."</p>
    <p>"Pretend we're Jaffa?" Jack interrupted the brewing argument. He looked dubiously at D'argo and Sam whom Daniel was patching up. "I don't think we'll be able to pull that off."</p>
    <p>"Then are we close enough to an outside wall to blow a new door?" asked Aeryn going back to her original idea.</p>
    <p>"We may be indeed," said Teal'c thoughtfully. He stood from his crouched position and turned toward the back wall. "It may take three blasts to burst free and I do not know if our explosives are powerful enough to take down the walls. But it is possible. We would have to set each successive detonation quickly for they will draw the Jaffa to us."</p>
    <p>"Alright then," said Jack. "Let's break out the toys and do this."</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Twenty minutes later, bloody and bruised from the shrapnel, SG-1, John, and Aeryn with their wounded in tow were running for the forest as if a squad of, well, Jaffa were on their tails. Jack was amazed they had made it out with only minimal damage through the four hallways between them and freedom. It was certainly a new way to escape from a Goa'uld palace and surprisingly effective. All alive and almost at the 'gate. All in a day's work.</p>
    <p>The Jaffa were within shooting range by the time they reached the 'gate clearing. Daniel immediately started dialing up the SGC while Jack and their new friends covered their retreat. Finally the comforting sound of the wormhole engaging whooshed out behind them. Running backward, Jack was the last to dive through. He landed heavily on the ramp, barely noticing the impact as he shouted, "Close the iris!" Only when the metal shield spun over the open wormhole did he relax. Two thuds on the other side echoed through the still room as the chasing Jaffa met their fate.</p>
    <p>Jack picked himself up and smiled at General Hammond at the bottom of the ramp.</p>
    <p>"Welcome back, Colonel," said the General. "You're two days overdue. I was beginning to get worried."</p>
    <p>Jack just grinned wider. Trust George to downplay his concern. "You know us, sir," he replied walking down to meet him. "And we picked up some new friends on the way. I'd like to introduce John Crichton and Aeryn Sun and their friend by Teal'c is D'argo."</p>
    <p>"Welcome to Earth Mr. Crichton, Ms. Sun," the General shook their hands. Neither John nor Aeryn smiled back; in fact they looked downright suspicious. But as Janet and her medical teams bustled in and took charge, Jack gave it little thought. They were back home, safe, and in relatively good shape. "Colonel, we'll debrief in two hours."</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Finally! Got them out in one piece. Except for Sam and D'argo. (I swear writing makes me evil.) But hey, they're safe on Earth! (He he he . . .)</p>

    Section 29: Medics and Movies<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"It's standard procedure after we 'gate in," Daniel was saying. "We have to make sure a Goa'uld didn't hitch a ride or that we picked up some deadly disease offworld. It's not fun when we find out after the fact." He grimaced wryly as he said this, and Aeryn knew he was speaking from experience. Knowing though didn't make her feel any better about having some doctor examining her.</p>
    <p>The two of them were briskly following the caravan of gurneys with Teal'c and John through steel gray corridors that were oddly familiar in their martial simplicity. Colored stripes and periodic lettering on the walls were the only distinguishing features in the windowless maze. Aeryn was having difficulty remembering their path. Hopefully John would have better luck with his native language.</p>
    <p>"So this is just a standard physical?" John asked. He was more relaxed than Aeryn was in this new environment, but that was only to be expected.</p>
    <p>"Standard physical, blood check, and a CAT scan where Janet takes a look at what's in your head," Daniel clarified. "It's not that bad. Plus, we get painkillers."</p>
    <p>"Says the person who belongs here," Aeryn muttered. Daniel stopped at that and placed a hand on her arm.</p>
    <p>"Nothing's going to happen to you here, Aeryn," he said seriously, his eyes fixing on hers, begging for her trust. "We won't let it. Me, Jack, Teal'c, the General, and everybody at the SGC is on your side. We stopped the higher ups from getting their hands on Teal'c when he first joined us and since then we've helped countless aliens. This is just a check-up."</p>
    <p>He was sincere, but she couldn't stop the feeling of apprehension. Nevertheless, Aeryn nodded for Daniel because she did trust him, come what may. When Daniel let her go and continued on, she shot John a look to which he nodded. There was trust and then there was trust.</p>
    <p>The infirmary was already busy by the time they caught up. They arrived just in time to see a nurse pull a curtain around Sam's bed. At the other end of the room, other med techs bustled around D'argo hooking him up to machines. The person inspecting his head and neck looked up when they came in.</p>
    <p>"Daniel," the short woman gently set the Luxan's head back on the gurney and purposefully walked towards them. She had red hair tied tightly to her head and intense eyes that brooked no room for argument. "I'm Dr. Frasier.  What can you tell me about my patient?"</p>
    <p>"How bad is it?" asked John.</p>
    <p>The doctor turned and gave him a quick appraising look. "He's unconscious.  He has a dead Goa'uld lodged in the tentacle that covers his neck and bad tearing underneath where it was trying to get in. Given the progress it made, I'm surprised the Goa'uld didn't take him over. But right now I need to know everything you know about his physiology so I can get him in and out of surgery without killing him." She lifted her eyebrows expectantly for a report. Aeryn blinked at the absolute confidence that radiated from the petite woman and found herself liking and trusting her. She had taken D'argo under her protection and was determined to see him back to health. A knot of worry for her friend loosened in Aeryn's stomach.</p>
    <p>"We'll tell you what we can," said John. Frasier nodded and snagged a clipboard from nearby to take notes.</p>
    <p>"So Aeryn," said Daniel once the doctor had hurried off to surgery with D'argo. "I know you were on Earth in your universe. Anything you missed then that you want to see on this trip?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn glanced at him surprised, wondering just where the question had come from. She had a few microts distraction when the techs led them to beds for their physicals. Daniel ended up between her and John.</p>
    <p>"Aeryn?" he was waiting for an answer.</p>
    <p>"I don't know," she said, thinking back over her first visit. "We were in Florida then. We had a guarded house to live in to keep the press away." The woman inspecting her held a bright light to her eyes.</p>
    <p>"Well, no one knows you're here now."</p>
    <p>"Where are we anyway?" asked John from the other side.</p>
    <p>"Colorado at the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Base," said Daniel.</p>
    <p>"NORAD?" asked John, surprised. Aeryn recognized the name from their previous visit but couldn't place it.</p>
    <p>"Actually they're about twenty floors above us," Daniel smiled. "We're one of the best kept secrets in the world. Officially we do deep space radar telemetry down here."</p>
    <p>Aeryn smiled at that. "Glorified sensor technicians?" She tried to look at him, but the woman now poking around her ear firmly held her head in place.  "Sorry."</p>
    <p>The woman smiled, obviously used to it.</p>
    <p>"So, anywhere you want to go?" Daniel returned to his earlier question. "There's not much in Colorado Springs I guess. We have the park, the mall . . ." he trained off thinking. "The mountains are always an option."</p>
    <p>"Where do you go?" asked John.</p>
    <p>"Jack's house," Daniel shrugged with a wry grin. "I don't get out much."</p>
    <p>"What about the films?" Aeryn asked, succeeding this time in getting a look out of the corner of her eye. It didn't last long when the nurse pulled a curtain around her bed. A little nervous at the sudden separation, Aeryn continued talking. "We only watched that one on the television."</p>
    <p>"Yeah, we could do that," said Daniel as if there were no barrier between them. "I don't know what's playing but we can look it up online as soon as we get cleared out of here. What type of movies do you like?"</p>
    <p>Aeryn hissed when cold hands inspected her abdomen under her shirt. The nurse smiled apologetically. "Last thing, honest," she said. Aeryn nodded and thought about the movie they had watched at Jack's - John's father's - house. It had been about Christmas and an old fat man that everyone thought was a myth. She remembered crying at one point.</p>
    <p>"I liked the Christmas one," she said.</p>
    <p>"It's a little early for Christmas, but I'm sure we can find something like it. A family movie or maybe a comedy," said Daniel. "I don't really like action. Get enough of that at work."</p>
    <p>He and John began throwing out titles of movies Aeryn should see as part of her Earth culture experience. While they were at the CAT machine, Daniel told them what Jack had given and gotten Teal'c hooked on. Aeryn listened, asking about plots and characters they mentioned that she recognized from the earthisms John had spouted over the cycles. By the time the medical exam was over, Daniel had volunteered Jack to host a movie night as soon as they could go off base.</p>
    <p>"Will he mind?" asked John after Daniel's pronouncement.</p>
    <p>"Nah," Daniel grinned. "It'll be fine. Come on, let's go check on Sam."</p>

    Jared doesn't think there's anything <em>wrong</em> about him having a bit of a crush on Dean Winchester.
    
    He figures it's pretty much understandable. Maybe even to be expected. After all, Dean looks almost exactly like Jensen, only cockier, with harder edges and a razor-sharp grin. What's more, Jared knows Dean, has spent so much time in-character with him that he practically considers him a real person now, someone who cracks him up and infuriates him and just makes him <em>feel</em> at a level way deeper than he'd ever imagined a fictional character could. And when someone calls "Cut!", Dean shoots him a grin that says he knows <em>exactly </em>what he's doing to Jared before melting back into Jensen, smiling softer but with a wicked gleam in his eyes, and some days Jared isn't sure he can wait until they get back to their trailers before he jumps his co-star.
    
    But though he doesn't think his crush on Dean is <em>wrong</em>, he does occasionally worry that Jensen might take it the wrong way, figure that he's just a stand-in for his alter-ego or something equally ridiculous, especially since Jensen's been suffering from character bleed on and off this season. So Jared tries to keep his crush under control: tries not to jump Jensen while he's still wearing Dean's clothes, tries to stop himself from smiling stupidly when he hears music playing that he knows Dean would love, tries not to get too turned on while watching Dean from the sidelines when he has a scene without Sam.
    
    Not that that's always easy. Especially when Dean's chanting in Latin, voice cold and strong as he paces around the female demon, the unfamiliar words on Dean's lips going straight to Jared's cock, and he has to melt away into the darkness once the incantation's over so he can take care of his problem before Jensen returns, shucking off Dean's voice along with his jacket.
    
    Yeah, refraining from jerking off while thinking about Dean is another thing Jared needs to work on.
    
    He suspects that Jensen might have an inkling about his crush, but he's seemed more vaguely amused than pissed so far, and Jared's really hoping he managed to pass off the incident in Jensen's trailer the other week as him simply finding Jensen really, really hot in a leather jacket throwing knives at his dart board. Because, well, Jensen <em>was </em>really, really hot like that. The fact that it had been like walking in to find Dean occupying his co-star's trailer had nothing to do with it. Really.
    
    Shit, he is in so much trouble.
    
    And while he doesn't think it's <em>wrong</em>, it does feel just close enough to being unfaithful to make him uneasy. Which is screwed up, because having a crush on a character played by your significant other can hardly count as cheating, can it? And it's not like it could ever go anywhere, what with Dean not really <em>existing </em>outside their heads. So there's no call to freak out about it. Especially considering how understandable it is. Dean is fucking hot, that's all there is to it. So is Jensen. It's all good.
    
    Except Jared really is kind of freaking out a bit. And when Jensen <em>almost </em>walks into Jared's trailer one evening while Jared's jerking off in the shower with Dean's name on his lips, Jared panics and takes himself off to a bar to get very, very drunk just as soon as he's managed to towel off and shrug on some clothes.
    
    It's a good bar for angsting in. Jared hardly ever comes here; he likes bright places with happy people, where he can laugh and joke and hang out with his friends. This bar is dimly lit and near-deserted, but at least he can be assured of anonymity while he tries to drink himself into oblivion. He stares moodily down at his bottle of beer, peeling the label away in shreds.
    
    The jukebox starts playing Metallica, and Jared laughs bitterly under his breath. He's not drunk enough for this shit.
    
    "This seat taken?"
    
    Jared's head snaps up so fast he almost gets whiplash, because he <em>knows</em> that voice.
    
    Dean doesn't bother to wait for permission, which is just as well, since Jared isn't sure he could say a word out right now. This is Dean in front of him, not Jensen; they look very alike, but not quite identical, and Jared can tell the difference immediately, recognises the assessing look in Dean's eyes as he settles down opposite him, the faint smirk as he takes in Jared's slack-jawed expression, the slight tilt to his head that says <b><em>oh </b>yeah</em>.
    
    Jared just stares for a long moment, taking in Dean's leather jacket, the amulet against his chest, the bracelet twined around his wrist, the ring clinking against the beer bottle. Dean's eyes have the same intensity that keeps him hooked when he's playing Sam, but he's never had that intensity directed at him as <em>Jared </em>before, and in two seconds flat he's gone from angsting to so turned on it hurts.
    
    For a stupid moment he feels he should... say something, ask Jensen what he's doing, if this is okay, if he's sure, but Dean raises his beer bottle to his lips and tilts his head back, and the motion of his throat as he swallows drives everything else out of Jared's mind.
    
    "So," Dean says, setting his beer down with a <em>clink</em>, eyes still gazing intently at Jared. "That beer do somethin' to piss you off? The way you were glaring at it just now, I figured maybe I should step in."
    
    Jared can't help but laugh. "What, protect me from the beer bottle?"
    
    "Nah," Dean says dismissively. "You look like you could take it." His eyes sweep appreciatively down Jared's body, and Jared feels his heart speed up. "But I figured the beer bottle might need protecting from you. It's pretty defenceless." He reaches out and takes it from Jared's grasp, his fingers trailing across the backs of Jared's hands for a moment before he pulls back and lifts the bottle to his mouth.
    
    Jared stares at those lips wrapped around the bottle he had been drinking from himself just a few minutes before, and tries not to whimper.
    
    "You got a name?" Dean asks, lowering Jared's beer, fingers grazing absently over the shredded label.
    
    Jared manages to pull himself together enough to reply, even if he is almost too turned on to think. "Jared."
    
    Dean nods in response. "Dean." The faint smile playing at his lips tells Jared that his reactions are not going unnoticed. "So, Jared, you play pool?"
    
    It takes Jared a moment to drag his mind away from <em>musthavesexnow </em>to the concept of playing pool. "Uh, yeah. You want a game?"
    
    Dean's smile is wicked. "Bring it on. And bring your beer, too. But treat it right this time." He shoves the bottle and it skates back across the table to Jared, who catches it without looking away from Dean's gaze. Dean pushes to his feet and heads over towards the pool tables.
    
    Jared watches the unconscious grace of Dean's movements, then raises the bottle to his lips and takes a sip, feeling it burn against his lips like a kiss, before he follows.
    
    He finds it difficult to concentrate on the game, unsurprisingly. Normally, Jared's pretty good at pool, but Dean is better than him - better than Jensen, for that matter, and that kind of breaks Jared's brain if he thinks about it too much, so he doesn't. Fortunately, it's easy to distract himself, because Dean playing pool is one giant distraction. Jared figures he's got it down to a fine art, since normally he's hustling for money. Everything he does - bending over the pool table, shirt hitching up to reveal his lower back; leaning casually against the bar, fingers absently stroking along the pool cue cradled in his hands; prowling around the table as Jared bends over to take his shot, green eyes like a weight on Jared's back - is driving Jared crazy, and he's pretty sure he's never lost a game of pool this badly in his life. Not that he gives a damn. 
    
    Dean grins at him, because they both know he's won. He sinks the last few balls confidently, then straightens, and the heat in his eyes makes Jared swallow hard.
    
    "Good game," Jared says, because he's not entirely sure how Dean would react to 'Can we have sex now?'
    
    Dean grins slowly. "Do I win a prize?" He sets the pool cue down and stalks slowly around the table towards Jared.
    
    
    
    Jared puts down his own cue and takes a deep breath, before suddenly realising: this is <em>Dean</em>. Why exactly is he worrying about Dean's reaction to being hit on?
    
    "Yeah," Jared says, his voice sounding rough to his own ears. "I think you do."
    
    Heat flashes in Dean's eyes and he reaches out to grab his jacket without breaking eye contact. "Then how about we get outta here?"
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Jared's so far gone that when they walk out of the bar and he sees the Impala waiting, he doesn't even think to question it until they're halfway back to his apartment. After a moment, though, he shrugs off his surprise. It was pretty obvious already that Jensen's put some thought into this. When it comes to acting, he's a perfectionist.
    
    "Straight ahead?" Dean asks, interrupting as if he knows Jared's over-thinking now.
    
    "Uh, no, left at the crossroads," Jared says, and stops thinking.
    
    The parking garage beneath Jared's apartment building is dimly lit and dingy, lights crackling overhead. Dean barely has time to park the Impala before Jared is on him.
    
    There's not enough room for Jared to crawl into Dean's lap comfortably, but he does his best, pressing Dean back against the seat, feeling the steering wheel jam into his spine. Dean is making pleased noises and kissing him back, those goddamn lips that drive Jared crazy at the best of times now hot and demanding against his own.
    
    Dean kisses differently to Jensen. Kissing Jensen is soft and warm and like falling, and Jared never wants to stop. Dean's kiss is hungry, demanding, as hot and ruthless as his knife-throwing, and Jared thinks that if they keep it up too long he might pass out.
    
    He tries to press closer, but there really is no room, and the steering wheel is definitely doing its best to thwart him.
    
    Dean pulls away, laughing low and dirty. "I like the way you think, but why don't we take this someplace I can strip those jeans off you?"
    
    Jared is out of the car and tugging Dean towards the elevator faster than he would have thought humanly possible.
    
    Inside the elevator, Dean shoves Jared up against the mirrored wall and tugs his head down for another kiss. Jared moans and pulls him closer, slipping one hand beneath the turned-up collar of that damnable leather jacket, running his fingers along the nape of Dean's neck, curling his hand around the knot of the cord on which Dean's amulet hangs. Dean almost <em>growls</em>, and Jared is giving serious thought to hitting the emergency stop button and just fucking up against the elevator wall when the doors spring open with a <em>ding</em>.
    
    They stumble down the corridor to the apartment door. Jared fumbles with his keys, his hands shaking, and Dean doesn't help, pressed up tight behind him, mouth hot against his neck. Jared moans, half in arousal, half in frustration, and then <em>thank god </em>the door opens and he stumbles inside. Dean moves with him, and Jared slams the door closed and then slams Dean up against it.
    
    Dean seems to have no problem with being manhandled; he leans up, face tilting to meet Jared's lips as they close on his. Jared pushes at Dean's jacket, and Dean shoves away from the wall, pressing into Jared to give himself room to shrug it off. Jared starts working on the buttons of Dean's shirt, then moans into his mouth as he feels Dean's hands slip beneath his shirt and t-shirt to slide up his back, fingernails grazing just hard enough to make him shudder.
    
    Jared breaks the kiss so that he can trace the line of Dean's jaw with his mouth, savouring the texture of Dean's stubble against his lips. Dean throws his head back with a groan, an irresistible invitation for Jared to nip his way down his neck, sucking hard as he feels Dean's hands start working on the buckle of his belt, and that's it, Jared can't even think any more. Everything descends into a blurred flurry of movement as they scramble out of their own clothes and tug off each other's.
    
    They stumble blindly through Jared's apartment, tripping over furniture because they can't stop kissing, can't stop touching, can't pull away long enough to look where they're going. Jared hears something topple over and the shatter of breaking glass, but he couldn't give a damn. They reach the door to Jared's bedroom and Dean presses him up hard against the doorframe, sucking at his throat, pushing a thigh between Jared's legs and against his cock. Jared moans helplessly and can't stop himself from rocking against Dean's thigh; it's a minute before he can think clearly enough to put his hands on Dean's chest to shove him back, into the room and onto the bed.
    
    They roll together, pressing and pulling, gasping for air and kissing like they can't stop. There's no thinking now, just heat. Dean's amulet grazes along Jared's chest as they kiss, then brushes against his nipple, and Jared breaks the kiss, throwing his head back and moaning desperately. Dean grins at him and starts working his way down Jared's body, mouth and amulet blazing winding, interlocking trails that make Jared's stomach muscles jump. Then Dean is tugging down Jared's boxers and wrapping warm fingers around his cock.
    
    Jared's not quiet at the best of times, and especially not during sex, but he doesn't think he's ever been this out of control. He cries out and mentally thanks god for the fact that his apartment has good soundproofing, for the fact that he has such an awesome lover, for the fact that Dean's mouth is now closing around his cock. Normally he would try to be considerate when someone is going down on him, but he's long past being able to control his body's response to Dean, and he can't stop himself from thrusting up hard into his mouth. But then Dean's hands close firmly on his hips, holding him down, controlling him, and Jared thinks he might just come from that alone.
    
    Dean pulls off him for a moment, and Jared can't hold back a whimper. "Lube?" Dean asks, his voice low and sex-roughened.
    
    "Top drawer," Jared chokes out, his own voice shot to hell.
    
    He lies still and tries to catch his breath while Dean leans over to fish around in the drawer, settling back a moment later with lube and a condom. Then a slick finger pushes against Jared, circling, then into him, as straightforward and intense as Dean himself. Before Jared can do more than moan, Dean's mouth is hot around his cock again, and Jared's brain short-circuits into <em>need</em> and <em>now</em> and <em>ohgoddon'tstop</em>.
    
    He's close, so close, and when Dean pulls off him again he damn-near sobs. Dean's hands are shaking as they stroke his thighs reassuringly and push his legs up. Then Dean thrusts into him, unhesitating and uncompromising, and Jared arches his back and cries out. It's good, so fucking good, and hurts just enough for him not to come instantly, pulling him back from the brink.
    
    Dean braces himself with his hands on either side of Jared's face and begins to move. The pace he sets is a little rougher and faster than Jensen would, and Jared pushes up to meet him, encouraging him to lose control. He reaches up to touch Dean's amulet and then the taut planes of Dean's face, before tangling his hand in Dean's hair and pulling him down for a kiss. Dean's amulet grazes along his chest again, and Jared moans into his mouth.
    
    Dean wraps a hand around Jared's cock. Jared almost wants to stop him, because he doesn't want to come, doesn't want to leave this moment. But Dean's thrusts inside him are becoming jerkier, slowly starting to lose their rhythm as he gets close. He's hitting <em>that </em>spot, his hand working Jared's cock, his green eyes holding Jared's gaze: it's all too much, and suddenly Jared is almost screaming as he comes. A few more erratic thrusts and Dean follows him, mouth working soundlessly, before he collapses on top of Jared.
    
    It's a long moment before either of them can move, but eventually Dean presses a kiss to Jared's chest and pulls out of him. Jared is almost asleep already, utterly boneless and satiated. He's only vaguely aware of Dean cleaning them both up and climbing back into bed, but he remains conscious just long enough to curl himself around Dean. He's asleep before Dean can voice any complaint about the snuggling.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Jared wakes up the next morning to find Jensen curled up in his arms, warm and smiling, blinking up at him sleepily.
    
    "You," Jared starts, then shakes his head, because for once in his life he is just about speechless. "<em>Jesus</em>, Jensen."
    
    Jensen's smile widens into a grin, and he tugs Jared down for a kiss.
    
    "You're welcome," he says when their lips finally part, quite some time later. "Think you're done angsting about it, now?"
    
    Jared stares at him. "Holy shit, Jensen." Yeah, the angsting is pretty much <em>forgotten</em> in favour of wondering whether Jensen would maybe be willing to do this again sometime. Hell, role-playing is what they <em>do</em>, right? Suddenly Jared can't remember why he was worried about this whole thing in the first place.
    
    Jensen chuckles lazily, and pulls Jared back down on top of him. "Glad you liked."
    
    "'Liked'," Jared murmurs incredulously, going with him willingly and resting his head on Jensen's chest. "Jesus."
    
    Jensen's heart beats steadily beneath him, and Jared has almost let it lull him back to sleep when he hears Jensen's voice murmur in his ear.
    
    "'Sides, maybe if I'm lucky you'll return the favour some day."

    Sam was looking around the gas station for inspiration for a Christmas present for Dean when his eyes fell on the popcorn.
    
    He didn't eat popcorn often - he liked it fine, but it was the only kind of junk food he'd ever come across that Dean didn't like, so they tended to buy other things instead. The sight of it now brought back other memories, though: Jess smacking away his hand when he made a grab for the popcorn she was stringing together, helping her to hang the popcorn garlands on their Christmas tree. It was a tradition the Winchesters had missed entirely, growing up; their Christmas "celebrations" had always been somewhat makeshift.
    
    Sam had already decided that this year was going to be different. Last year, with the deal hanging over their heads, he'd had to force himself to go through with Christmas for Dean's sake. This year... this year, he really did feel like celebrating.
    
    He grabbed a packet of popcorn and headed to the desk. He'd have to think more about presents, but he still had time. Popcorn strings for the tree would be a good start.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    Threading popcorn was an oddly peaceful pastime, Sam thought. It kept his hands busy, but left his mind free to wander. The associations with Jessica had lost their power to hurt him: now they just made him smile, before he thought about the expression on Dean's face the previous year when he'd walked in to see Sam's decorations. It had made all the trouble of organising it secretly and all the stress of trying to celebrate while knowing it might be Dean's last Christmas worthwhile. And Dean might be expecting eggnog this year, but a proper tree, with garlands? Sam was looking forward to springing that surprise on him.
    
    He was just tying a knot in the thread to hold the popcorn in place when he heard the sound of a key in the lock.
    
    <em>Damn</em>. What was Dean doing back so soon? Sam grabbed his half-finished string of popcorn, looked around frantically, and finally shoved it out of sight beneath the nearest pillow. The last thing he wanted was for his surprise to be ruined. Then he swung his legs up and lay back on the bed, trying to look casual.
    
    "Hey," Dean said, closing the door behind him and throwing the key down on the table. He set a paper bag down more gently and stripped off his coat. "So, the kid seems to be fine."
    
    "Good," Sam said. He'd been fairly sure she would be, now that she'd been reunited with her family, but he hadn't been surprised that Dean had wanted to check up on her. He felt a warm rush of affection for his brother. "You pick out a Christmas present for her?"
    
    "I had an idea, yeah," Dean said. "We can pick it up later on and take it round."
    
    "Okay," Sam agreed. "What's in the bag?"
    
    Dean grinned, slow and promising. "Pie."
    
    Sam knew his brother far too well to be surprised by the combination of <em>that</em> smile and food. If there were three things in the world that Dean loved, they were Sam, sex and food, and he took every opportunity he could to combine them. Sam figured it was only the mess caused by sex involving food that held Dean back from bringing the Impala into that equation more often. And even though Sam didn't share Dean's obsession with food, he was usually happy to indulge it. He wasn't immune to that smile.
    
    "What kind of pie?" Sam asked, trying to appear unaffected.
    
    The way Dean's grin widened told him he hadn't succeeded. "Lemon meringue." He grabbed the bag and crawled up onto the bed, close enough for Sam to feel how cold he still was from the chill air outside.
    
    He had a feeling that Dean would be heating up pretty soon, though.
    
    Eating slices of lemon meringue pie without a fork or even a plate was a pretty messy experience, but Sam figured Dean considered that part of the appeal. He certainly wasn't surprised when Dean leaned over after a couple of bites to lick away a smudge of cream from the corner of Sam's mouth, which turned into a teasing, flickering kiss, and then a deeper, more serious kiss, lemon flavour giving way to <em>Dean</em>.
    
    Sam was about ready to put his pie down and concentrate on more important matters, but Dean pressed his slice to Sam's lips instead. "Go on, Sammy."
    
    The only thing Sam didn't like about food sex was that he was never completely certain that it was him, rather than the food, that was putting that breathy, turned-on note into Dean's voice.
    
    <em>Better make sure, then</em>.
    
    He licked at the pie and moaned softly at the rich, bitter taste of lemon on his tongue, fighting back a grin at the way Dean's eyes darkened in response. Then he took a bite, letting his eyes fall closed as he savoured it, enjoying it even more when Dean's lips pressed to his, tongue slipping inside to steal a taste.
    
    "Sam," Dean murmured, pulling back, and then he was working on Sam's clothes, shoving his shirt aside to smear pie across his chest, licking it up with a moan.
    
    Things went rather hazy at that point. Sam suspected he'd just crushed half a slice of pie into the comforter, but he was too busy getting Dean out of his clothes to give a damn. And Dean finally seemed to be more interested in sex than pie, judging by the way he was moaning as Sam closed a hand around his cock. Sam couldn't help a small, triumphant smile at that.
    
    "Sam," Dean said, and writhed up as Sam shifted his grasp. "Oh, Jesus, Sam - fuck me, god."
    
    Sam kissed him instead of answering, pressing him down against the bed.
    
    "Sammy," Dean muttered breathlessly, sliding a hand beneath the pillows to find the lube. "Fuck -" He cut off suddenly, an odd expression crossing his face. "What...?"
    
    It was only when Dean pulled out the string of popcorn that Sam remembered he'd shoved it under there. <em>Damn, there's that surprise ruined</em>.
    
    Dean stared at it, frowning in confusion. "Dude, what...?" His voice trailed off as his eyes suddenly widened. "<em>Dude</em>."
    
    "I thought -" Sam started.
    
    "Dude," Dean repeated. He looked simultaneously horrified and morbidly curious, and just a little turned on. "You don't - you seriously want - I mean, you really want to...?"
    
    Sam wasn't entirely sure what conclusion Dean had jumped to, but he was pretty sure it didn't involve hanging the popcorn on the Christmas tree. "Uh, Dean -"
    
    "I mean," Dean said, and stopped again. "Wow, Sam, I didn't think you'd, uh. Be into - that."
    
    Sam eyed the popcorn with a certain morbid curiosity himself. Did he really want to know what Dean was thinking? His brother's mind could be a scary place at the best of times. On the other hand, the look on Dean's face was pretty hilarious. "Well, I thought it might be... nice."
    
    "Nice," Dean repeated dazedly.
    
    "Look, it's nothing," Sam said. "Just something Jess introduced me to - forget about it." He felt a little bad for playing Dean, but he justified it by reminding himself that he wasn't actually <em>lying</em>. Besides, he wanted to save his surprise if at all possible. So it was for Dean's own good. From a certain point of view.
    
    If anything, Dean's eyes got wider. "And you, uh, liked that?"
    
    Okay, Sam really had to find out what Dean was thinking now. "Sure. But we don't have to, you know."
    
    The thing was, Dean never backed down from any kind of challenge. Particularly when it came to sex. "No, we can - I mean, if you... I just never thought popcorn would be any good for - that. Doesn't it kind of - crumble?"
    
    "Not if you do it right," Sam said, and bit his tongue to keep from laughing.
    
    "Jesus," Dean muttered. "Okay, fine." He thrust the popcorn chain at Sam. "You'd better use lube before sticking that in me, though."
    
    It was just as well Dean's eyes were still glued to the popcorn, because Sam couldn't keep his own eyes from widening. Dean thought... Well, okay, Sam guessed popcorn was vaguely bead-shaped, and he knew that Dean mostly saw food and sex as one and the same thing, and admittedly Dean had found it under the pillow - but <em>seriously</em>?
    
    Oh, man, how was he going to get out of this one? Because Sam was pretty sure popcorn was <em>not</em> best suited to that kind of thing. And - just, no. Although it was kind of hot that Dean was willing to go along with it. Almost tempting.
    
    ...But no.
    
    "Well, it's not quite finished yet," Sam said, trying to keep his voice even. <em>Not going to laugh, not going to laugh</em>... "I need to add more popcorn -"
    
    "<em>More</em>?" Dean blurted.
    
    <em>Not going to laugh</em>. "Sure. And then it's best to let it harden for a day or so. I just shoved it out of sight when you came in, didn't want to ruin the surprise."
    
    "Oh," Dean said, trying not to look too obviously relieved and failing. "Well, if it's not finished -"
    
    "Popcorn doesn't go too well with lemon meringue pie, anyway," Sam said, and tossed the half-finished garland onto the nightstand, biting his cheek to keep from laughing at the way Dean's eyes tracked it. He ought to tell his brother, he really should. But Dean's reaction was far too amusing.
    
    "Right," Dean said, brightening. "Hey, you've got -" He swooped in to suck at a smudge of cream on Sam's neck.
    
    Sam grinned and set about distracting them both from the popcorn.
    
    <center>~*~</center>
    
    "Thank you!" the little girl squealed, running into the kitchen with her present. "Mommy, Mommy, look!"
    
    Dean laughed, and Sam grinned at the happiness on his brother's face. He was glad they'd been able to reunite this family before Christmas.
    
    "I can't thank you both enough," the kid's father said, running a hand through his greying hair. "Won't you stay for coffee?"
    
    "Coffee sounds great," Dean said, following him towards the kitchen.
    
    "Thanks," Sam added. Normally he didn't like sticking around for too long, didn't want to impose on people, but he was willing to bet that if they hung around a little longer, the little girl would wheedle Dean into playing with her new My Little Pony with her, and that Sam had to see.
    
    Just inside the kitchen, though, Dean froze. Sam peered round him to see what the problem was.
    
    The little girl's mother was sitting at the kitchen table, a bowl of popcorn beside her, calmly threading the pieces together into a garland.
    
    Dean's eyes were huge as they slid from the string of popcorn to the couple and back again, before he turned his head to stare at Sam. Sam bit his lip and tried not to bust a rib laughing.
    
    "Uh, actually," Dean said, and cleared his throat. His voice sounded rather higher-pitched than usual. "You know, you're obviously... busy, and we don't want to, uh, intrude, so we should probably be going, right, Sam?"
    
    Sam <em>really</em> wanted to stick around now, because the look on Dean's face was priceless. But he wasn't going to be able to keep from laughing for much longer. "Yeah, you're right. Thanks for the offer, though - I hope you all have a very merry Christmas."
    
    "Yeah, very merry," Dean echoed, staring at the popcorn.
    
    The couple tried to talk them into staying for coffee, but they managed to escape before Dean blurted out any comments on the couple's sex life or Sam actually suffocated from trying not to laugh at Dean's expression.
    
    "<em>Dude</em>," Dean hissed as they walked down the driveway. "Did you <em>see</em> what she was making?!"
    
    Sam had never heard Dean sound scandalised before. It was <em>awesome</em>.
    
    "Yeah," Sam said, trying desperately to keep a straight face.
    
    He couldn't wait to see the expression on Dean's face when he saw the decorated Christmas tree waiting back at the motel.

    [002] Ended the king's long story, with which all seemed to be very well pleased, quoth Dioneo with a laugh: \"The good man that looked that night to cause the bogey's tail to droop, would scarce have contributed two pennyworth of all the praise you bestow on Messer Torello:\" then, witting that it now only remained for him to tell, thus he began:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [003] Gentle my ladies, this day, meseems, is dedicate to Kings and Soldans and folk of the like quality; wherefore, that I stray not too far from you, I am minded to tell you somewhat of a Marquis; certes, nought magnificent, but a piece of mad folly, albeit there came good thereof to him in the end. The which I counsel none to copy, for that great pity 'twas that it turned out well with him.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [004] There was in olden days a certain Marquis of Saluzzo, Gualtieri by name, a young man, but head of the house, who, having neither wife nor child, passed his time in nought else but in hawking and hunting, and of taking a wife and begetting children had no thought; wherein he should have been accounted very wise: [005] but his vassals, brooking it ill, did oftentimes entreat him to take a wife, that he might not die without an heir, and they be left without a lord; offering to find him one of such a pattern, and of such parentage, that he might marry with good hope, and be well content with the sequel. [006] To whom: \"My friends,\" replied Gualtieri, \"you enforce me to that which I had resolved never to do, seeing how hard it is to find a wife, whose ways accord well with one's own, and how plentiful is the supply of such as run counter thereto, and how grievous a life he leads who chances upon a lady that matches ill with him. [007] And to say that you think to know the daughters by the qualities of their fathers and mothers, and thereby--so you would argue--to provide me with a wife to my liking, is but folly; for I wot not how you may penetrate the secrets of their mothers so as to know their fathers; and granted that you do know them, daughters oftentimes resemble neither of their parents. [008] However, as you are minded to rivet these fetters upon me, I am content that so it be; and that I may have no cause to reproach any but myself, should it turn out ill, I am resolved that my wife shall be of my own choosing; but of this rest assured, that, no matter whom I choose, if she receive not from you the honour due to a lady, you shall prove to your great cost, how sorely I resent being thus constrained by your importunity to take a wife against my will.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    The worthy men replied that they were well content, so only he would marry without more ado. [009] And Gualtieri, who had long noted with approval the mien of a poor girl that dwelt on a farm hard by his house, and found her fair enough, deemed that with her he might pass a tolerably happy life. Wherefore he sought no further, but forthwith resolved to marry her; and having sent for her father, who was a very poor man, he contracted with him to take her to wife. [010] Which done, Gualtieri assembled all the friends he had in those parts, and: \"My friends,\" quoth he, \"you were and are minded that I should take a wife, and rather to comply with your wishes, than for any desire that I had to marry, I have made up my mind to do so. [011] You remember the promise you gave me, to wit, that, whomsoever I should take, you would pay her the honour due to a lady. Which promise I now require you to keep, the time being come when I am to keep mine. [012] I have found hard by here a maiden after mine own heart, whom I purpose to take to wife, and to bring hither to my house in the course of a few days. Wherefore bethink you, how you may make the nuptial feast splendid, and welcome her with all honour; that I may confess myself satisfied with your observance of your promise, as you will be with my observance of mine.\"[013] The worthy men, one and all, answered with alacrity that they were well content, and that, whoever she might be, they would entreat her as a lady, and pay her all due honour as such. After which, they all addressed them to make goodly and grand and gladsome celebration of the event, as did also Gualtieri. [014] He arranged for a wedding most stately and fair, and bade thereto a goodly number of his friends and kinsfolk, and great gentlemen, and others, of the neighbourhood; and therewithal he caused many a fine and costly robe to be cut and fashioned to the figure of a girl who seemed to him of the like proportions as the girl that he purposed to wed; and laid in store, besides, of girdles and rings, with a costly and beautiful crown, and all the other paraphernalia of a bride.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [015] The day that he had appointed for the wedding being come, about half tierce he got him to horse with as many as had come to do him honour, and having made all needful dispositions: \"Gentlemen,\" quoth he, \"'tis time to go bring home the bride.\" And so away he rode with his company to the village; [016] where, being come to the house of the girl's father, they found her returning from the spring with a bucket of water, making all the haste she could, that she might afterwards go with the other women to see Gualtieri's bride come by. Whom Gualtieri no sooner saw, than he called her by her name, to wit, Griselda, and asked her where her father was. To whom she modestly made answer: \"My lord, he is in the house.\"[017] Whereupon Gualtieri dismounted, and having bidden the rest await him without, entered the cottage alone; and meeting her father, whose name was Giannucolo: \"I am come,\" quoth he, \"to wed Griselda, but first of all there are some matters I would learn from her own lips in thy presence.\"[018] He then asked her, whether, if he took her to wife, she would study to comply with his wishes, and be not wroth, no matter what he might say or do, and be obedient, with not a few other questions of a like sort: to all which she answered, ay. [019] Whereupon Gualtieri took her by the hand, led her forth, and before the eyes of all his company, and as many other folk as were there, caused her to strip naked, and let bring the garments that he had had fashioned for her, and had her forthwith arrayed therein, and upon her unkempt head let set a crown; [020] and then, while all wondered: \"Gentlemen,\" quoth he, \"this is she whom I purpose to make my wife, so she be minded to have me for husband.\" Then, she standing abashed and astonied, he turned to her, saying: \"Griselda, wilt thou have me for thy husband?\"[021] To whom: \"Ay, my lord,\" answered she. [022] \"And I will have thee to wife,\" said he, and married her before them all. And having set her upon a palfrey, he brought her home with pomp.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [023] The wedding was fair and stately, and had he married a daughter of the King of France, the feast could not have been more splendid. [024] It seemed as if, with the change of her garb, the bride had acquired a new dignity of mind and mien. She was, as we have said, fair of form and feature; and therewithal she was now grown so engaging and gracious and debonair, that she shewed no longer as the shepherdess, and the daughter of Giannucolo, but as the daughter of some noble lord, insomuch that she caused as many as had known her before to marvel. Moreover, she was so obedient and devoted to her husband, that he deemed himself the happiest and luckiest man in the world. [025] And likewise so gracious and kindly was she to her husband's vassals, that there was none of them but loved her more dearly than himself, and was zealous to do her honour, and prayed for her welfare and prosperity and aggrandisement, and instead of, as erstwhile, saying that Gualtieri had done foolishly to take her to wife, now averred that he had not his like in the world for wisdom and discernment, for that, save to him, her noble qualities would ever have remained hidden under her sorry apparel and the garb of the peasant girl. [026] And in short she so comported herself as in no long time to bring it to pass that, not only in the marquisate, but far and wide besides, her virtues and her admirable conversation were matter of common talk, and, if aught had been said to the disadvantage of her husband, when he married her, the judgment was now altogether to the contrary effect.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [027] She had not been long with Gualtieri before she conceived; and in due time she was delivered of a girl; whereat Gualtieri made great cheer. But, soon after, a strange humour took possession of him, to wit, to put her patience to the proof by prolonged and intolerable hard usage; wherefore he began by afflicting her with his gibes, putting on a vexed air, and telling her that his vassals were most sorely dissatisfied with her by reason of her base condition, and all the more so since they saw that she was a mother, and that they did nought but most ruefully murmur at the birth of a daughter. [028] Whereto Griselda, without the least change of countenance or sign of discomposure, made answer: \"My lord, do with me as thou mayst deem best for thine own honour and comfort, for well I wot that I am of less account than they, and unworthy of this honourable estate to which of thy courtesy thou hast advanced me.\"[029] By which answer Gualtieri was well pleased, witting that she was in no degree puffed up with pride by his, or any other's, honourable entreatment of her. [030] A while afterwards, having in general terms given his wife to understand that the vassals could not endure her daughter, he sent her a message by a servant. So the servant came, and: \"Madam,\" quoth he with a most dolorous mien, \"so I value my life, I must needs do my lord's bidding. He has bidden me take your daughter and . . .\"[031] He said no more, but the lady by what she heard, and read in his face, and remembered of her husband's words, understood that he was bidden to put the child to death. Whereupon she presently took the child from the cradle, and having kissed and blessed her, albeit she was very sore at heart, she changed not countenance, but placed it in the servant's arms, saying: [032] \"See that thou leave nought undone that my lord and thine has charged thee to do, but leave her not so that the beasts and the birds devour her, unless he have so bidden thee.\"[033] So the servant took the child, and told Gualtieri what the lady had said; and Gualtieri, marvelling at her constancy, sent him with the child to Bologna, to one of his kinswomen, whom he besought to rear and educate the child with all care, but never to let it be known whose child she was.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [034] Soon after it befell that the lady again conceived, and in due time was delivered of a son, whereat Gualtieri was overjoyed. But, not content with what he had done, he now even more poignantly afflicted the lady; and one day with a ruffled mien: [035] \"Wife,\" quoth he, \"since thou gavest birth to this boy, I may on no wise live in peace with my vassals, so bitterly do they reproach me that a grandson of Giannucolo is to succeed me as their lord; and therefore I fear that, so I be not minded to be sent a packing hence, I must even do herein as I did before, and in the end put thee away, and take another wife.\"[036] The lady heard him patiently, and answered only: \"My lord, study how thou mayst content thee and best please thyself, and waste no thought upon me, for there is nought I desire save in so far as I know that 'tis thy pleasure.\"[037] Not many days after, Gualtieri, in like manner as he had sent for the daughter, sent for the son, and having made a shew of putting him to death, provided for his, as for the girl's, nurture at Bologna. [038] Whereat the lady shewed no more discomposure of countenance or speech than at the loss of her daughter: which Gualtieri found passing strange, and inly affirmed that there was never another woman in the world that would have so done. And but that he had marked that she was most tenderly affectionate towards her children, while 'twas well pleasing to him, he had supposed that she was tired of them, whereas he knew that 'twas of her discretion that she so did. [039] His vassals, who believed that he had put the children to death, held him mightily to blame for his cruelty, and felt the utmost compassion for the lady. She, however, said never aught to the ladies that condoled with her on the death of her children, but that the pleasure of him that had begotten them was her pleasure likewise.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [040] Years not a few had passed since the girl's birth, when Gualtieri at length deemed the time come to put his wife's patience to the final proof. Accordingly, in the presence of a great company of his vassals he declared that on no wise might he longer brook to have Griselda to wife, that he confessed that in taking her he had done a sorry thing and the act of a stripling, and that he therefore meant to do what he could to procure the Pope's dispensation to put Griselda away, and take another wife: for which cause being much upbraided by many worthy men, he made no other answer but only that needs must it so be. [041] Whereof the lady being apprised, and now deeming that she must look to go back to her father's house, and perchance tend the sheep, as she had aforetime, and see him, to whom she was utterly devoted, engrossed by another woman, did inly bewail herself right sorely: but still with the same composed mien with which she had borne Fortune's former buffets, she set herself to endure this last outrage. [042] Nor was it long before Gualtieri by counterfeit letters, which he caused to be sent to him from Rome, made his vassals believe that the Pope had thereby given him a dispensation to put Griselda away, and take another wife. Wherefore, having caused her to be brought before him, he said to her in the presence of not a few: [043] \"Wife, by license granted me by the Pope, I am now free to put thee away, and take another wife; and, for that my forbears have always been great gentlemen and lords of these parts, whereas thine have ever been husbandmen, I purpose that thou go back to Giannucolo's house with the dowry that thou broughtest me; whereupon I shall bring home a lady that I have found, and who is meet to be my wife.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [044] 'Twas not without travail most grievous that the lady, as she heard this announcement, got the better of her woman's nature, and suppressing her tears, made answer: \"My lord, I ever knew that my low degree was on no wise congruous with your nobility, and acknowledged that the rank I had with you was of your and God's bestowal, nor did I ever make as if it were mine by gift, or so esteem it, but still accounted it as a loan. 'Tis your pleasure to recall it, and therefore it should be, and is, my pleasure to render it up to you. So, here is your ring, with which you espoused me; take it back. [045] You bid me take with me the dowry that I brought you; which to do will require neither paymaster on your part nor purse nor packhorse on mine; for I am not unmindful that naked was I when you first had me. And if you deem it seemly that that body in which I have borne children, by you begotten, be beheld of all, naked will I depart; but yet, I pray you, be pleased, in guerdon of the virginity that I brought you and take not away, to suffer me to bear hence upon my back a single shift--I crave no more--besides my dowry.\"[046] There was nought of which Gualtieri was so fain as to weep; but yet, setting his face as a flint, he made answer: \"I allow thee a shift to thy back; so get thee hence.\"[047] All that stood by besought him to give her a robe, that she, who had been his wife for thirteen years and more, might not be seen to quit his house in so sorry and shameful a plight, having nought on her but a shift. But their entreaties went for nothing: the lady in her shift, and barefoot and bareheaded, having bade them adieu, departed the house, and went back to her father amid the tears and lamentations of all that saw her. [048] Giannucolo, who had ever deemed it a thing incredible that Gualtieri should keep his daughter to wife, and had looked for this to happen every day, and had kept the clothes that she had put off on the morning that Gualtieri had wedded her, now brought them to her; and she, having resumed them, applied herself to the petty drudgery of her father's house, as she had been wont, enduring with fortitude this cruel visitation of adverse Fortune.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [049] Now no sooner had Gualtieri dismissed Griselda, than he gave his vassals to understand that he had taken to wife a daughter of one of the Counts of Panago. He accordingly made great preparations as for the nuptials, during which he sent for Griselda. To whom, being come, quoth he: [050] \"I am bringing hither my new bride, and in this her first home-coming I purpose to shew her honour; and thou knowest that women I have none in the house that know how to set chambers in due order, or attend to the many other matters that so joyful an event requires; wherefore do thou, that understandest these things better than another, see to all that needs be done, and bid hither such ladies as thou mayst see fit, and receive them, as if thou wert the lady of the house, and then, when the nuptials are ended, thou mayst go back to thy cottage.\"[051] Albeit each of these words pierced Griselda's heart like a knife, for that, in resigning her good fortune, she had not been able to renounce the love she bore Gualtieri, nevertheless: \"My lord,\" she made answer, \"I am ready and prompt to do your pleasure.\"[052] And so, clad in her sorry garments of coarse romagnole, she entered the house, which, but a little before, she had quitted in her shift, and addressed her to sweep the chambers, and arrange arras and cushions in the halls, and make ready the kitchen, and set her hand to everything, as if she had been a paltry serving-wench: nor did she rest until she had brought all into such meet and seemly trim as the occasion demanded. [053] This done, she invited in Gualtieri's name all the ladies of those parts to be present at his nuptials, and awaited the event. The day being come, still wearing her sorry weeds, but in heart and soul and mien the lady, she received the ladies as they came, and gave each a gladsome greeting.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [054] Now Gualtieri, as we said, had caused his children to be carefully nurtured and brought up by a kinswoman of his at Bologna, which kinswoman was married into the family of the Counts of Panago; and, the girl being now twelve years old, and the loveliest creature that ever was seen, and the boy being about six years old, he had sent word to his kinswoman's husband at Bologna, praying him to be pleased to come with this girl and boy of his to Saluzzo, and to see that he brought a goodly and honourable company with him, and to give all to understand that he brought the girl to him to wife, and on no wis\xC3\xA8 to disclose to any, who she really was. [055] The gentleman did as the Marquis bade him, and within a few days of his setting forth arrived at Saluzzo about breakfast-time with the girl, and her brother, and a noble company, and found all the folk of those parts, and much people besides, gathered there in expectation of Gualtieri's new bride. [056] Who, being received by the ladies, was no sooner come into the hall, where the tables were set, than Griselda advanced to meet her, saying with hearty cheer: \"Welcome, my lady.\" So the ladies, who had with much instance, but in vain, besought Gualtieri, either to let Griselda keep in another room, or at any rate to furnish her with one of the robes that had been hers, that she might not present herself in such a sorry guise before the strangers, sate down to table; and the service being begun, [057] the eyes of all were set on the girl, and every one said that Gualtieri had made a good exchange, and Griselda joined with the rest in greatly commending her, and also her little brother. [058] And now Gualtieri, sated at last with all that he had seen of his wife's patience, marking that this new and strange turn made not the least alteration in her demeanour, and being well assured that 'twas not due to apathy, for he knew her to be of excellent understanding, deemed it time to relieve her of the suffering which he judged her to dissemble under a resolute front; and so, having called her to him in presence of them all, he said with a smile: \"And what thinkst thou of our bride?\"[059] \"My lord,\" replied Griselda, \"I think mighty well of her; and if she be but as discreet as she is fair--and so I deem her--I make no doubt but you may reckon to lead with her a life of incomparable felicity; but with all earnestness I entreat you, that you spare her those tribulations which you did once inflict upon another that was yours, for I scarce think she would be able to bear them, as well because she is younger, as for that she has been delicately nurtured, whereas that other had known no respite of hardship since she was but a little child.\"[060] Marking that she made no doubt but that the girl was to be his wife, and yet spoke never a whit the less sweetly, Gualtieri caused her to sit down beside him, and: [061] \"Griselda,\" said he, \"'tis now time that thou see the reward of thy long patience, and that those, who have deemed me cruel and unjust and insensate, should know that what I did was done of purpose aforethought, for that I was minded to give both thee and them a lesson, that thou mightst learn to be a wife, and they in like manner might learn how to take and keep a wife, and that I might beget me perpetual peace with thee for the rest of my life; whereof being in great fear, when I came to take a wife, lest I should be disappointed, I therefore, to put the matter to the proof, did, and how sorely thou knowest, harass and afflict thee. [062] And since I never knew thee either by deed or by word to deviate from my will, I now, deeming myself to have of thee that assurance of happiness which I desired, am minded to restore to thee at once all that, step by step, I took from thee, and by extremity of joy to compensate the tribulations that I inflicted on thee. [063] Receive, then, this girl, whom thou supposest to be my bride, and her brother, with glad heart, as thy children and mine. These are they, whom by thee and many another it has long been supposed that I did ruthlessly to death, and I am thy husband, that loves thee more dearly than aught else, deeming that other there is none that has the like good cause to be well content with his wife.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [064] Which said, he embraced and kissed her; and then, while she wept for joy, they rose and hied them there where sate the daughter, all astonied to hear the news, whom, as also her brother, they tenderly embraced, and explained to them, and many others that stood by, the whole mystery. [065] Whereat the ladies, transported with delight, rose from table and betook them with Griselda to a chamber, and, with better omen, divested her of her sorry garb, and arrayed her in one of her own robes of state; and so, in guise of a lady (howbeit in her rags she had shewed as no less) they led her back into the hall. [066] Wondrous was the cheer which there they made with the children; and, all overjoyed at the event, they revelled and made merry amain, and prolonged the festivities for several days; and very discreet they pronounced Gualtieri, albeit they censured as intolerably harsh the probation to which he had subjected Griselda, and most discreet beyond all compare they accounted Griselda.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [067] Some days after, the Count of Panago returned to Bologna, and Gualtieri took Giannucolo from his husbandry, and established him in honour as his father-in-law, wherein to his great solace he lived for the rest of his days. Gualtieri himself, having mated his daughter with a husband of high degree, lived long and happily thereafter with Griselda, to whom he ever paid all honour.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [Voice: dioneo]\r\n\
    [068] Now what shall we say in this case but that even into the cots of the poor the heavens let fall at times spirits divine, as into the palaces of kings souls that are fitter to tend hogs than to exercise lordship over men? Who but Griselda had been able, with a countenance not only tearless, but cheerful, to endure the hard and unheard-of trials to which Gualtieri subjected her? [069] Who perhaps might have deemed himself to have made no bad investment, had he chanced upon one, who, having been turned out of his house in her shift, had found means so to dust the pelisse of another as to get herself thereby a fine robe.\r\n\

  content: "<hr>First Meeting<hr>Jack scowled at the ringing phone. He was on leave. SG1 had finally gotten some downtime and the phone was not supposed to be ringing. The only people who called him were his teammates and he had just seen them out of his house. That only left the base, which was unfair on so many levels.<p>The phone rang again, and he contemplated not answering. Unfortunately, a niggling little voice in his head wouldn't let him turn his back on what could be the end of the world. Stupid conscience.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"O'Neill,\" he said just sharply enough to let whoever was calling that he was not happy.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Jonathon O'Neill?\" a cautious female voice queried.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Is this a solicitation?\" Jack asked suspiciously at the use of his first name.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No!\" said the woman quickly. \"Sorry. I'm Elena Acosta with the Sunnydale County Clerk's Office.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Sunnydale?\" Where had he heard that name before?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" the woman sighed heavily, tiredly. And then it clicked \xE2\x80\x93 the earthquake. Sinkholes underground had leveled a town in California last spring, about six months ago.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What can I do for you?\" asked Jack, softly now. The poor woman didn't need anymore crap after her hometown had sunk into the Earth.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this,\" said Elena. \"Jessica Harris died not long after the earthquake. You're in her Will.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Wait,\" Jack interrupted, his mind running over the unfamiliar name in his head. Who was Jessica Harris? He didn't know any Jessicas, did he?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry. I'm so bad at this,\" Elena apologized, which made Jack wonder how many people before him she had called to tell that their loved ones were dead and that there was a will with their name in it. He felt both guilty and puzzled that he didn't know this Jessica Harris, and he was about to tell Elena that when it clicked.</p>\r\n\
    <p>The beach house, LA. A two week leave before he headed out on maneuvers in South America. He'd met Sarah after he got back home, but lanky, dark Jessica was before all that. He'd known her barely two weeks. Why was he in her last Will?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\" asked Elena, and Jack realized he had mumbled that last allowed.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Nothing, sorry, go on,\" he said.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"In order to claim your inheritance, you need to come to our offices in Los Angeles with two government proofs of identity,\" Elena explained. \"Mrs. Harris managed to leave Sunnydale before the earthquake with her husband. I'm afraid I can't disclose more than that until I have proof you are Jonathan O'Neill.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How did she die?\" asked Jack.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"There was a riot in the neighborhood they were staying in. Neither she nor her husband made it.\" Again, Elena sounded apologetic and tired.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack was silent for a moment, taking it all in. He wasn't quite sure what it all meant, or how to cope with suddenly hearing about Jessica again, especially at her death. Guess he was going on vacation after all. \"I'll be there Friday.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Elena gave him the address and a complete list of all the documentation he would need to satisfy the government that yes, he had been born. Just when he thought he had everything, Elena added a startled, \"oh!\" as if she had forgotten something. \"Do you know where your son is, Mr. O'Neill?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack suddenly sat up straight. \"You mean Jessica's son?\" Sure she had made a mistake. She had had a son? Well, it only stood to reason since she had had a husband, he mentally berated himself.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" he heard Elena smile. \"Mrs. Harris's and yours.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\" That couldn't be possible. How could he have a son and not know about him? She must have read it wrong. \"We don't have a son.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh,\" Elena was clearly surprised. \"You didn't know?\" she ventured, her tone telling him not to be mad at her about it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack sighed. \"No,\" he said. He paused, thinking about this new possibility. \"Are you sure?\" he asked.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yes,\" said Elena. \"I'm looking at the birth certificate now. Well, once you get here, I'll give you his information so you can look him up if you want. I doubt we would find him any faster.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah.\" Jack felt stunned, shocked, whammied. How could he have a son and not know about him? Because Special Ops didn't leave a forwarding address. And it had never crossed his youthful brain that a couple of nights on leave would leave him with a son he didn't know. \"Thanks,\" he said absently. He barely registered Elena say good-bye and hang up.</p>\r\n\
    <p>He had a son. Maybe alive, somewhere. Out in the world. He looked at his hands counting the years. He would be twenty-two or twenty-three by now, a couple years older than Charlie. Grown up. He probably had a job somewhere, maybe a girlfriend. Jack wondered what he was like.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>The next day Jack called Daniel and trusted that word would get to Teal'c and Sam when they returned from their respective worlds of Chulak and the lab. The day after that, he was in the temporary clerk's office in LA waiting in line with hundreds of other people. The place was small for the masses and it smelled of smoke and too many bodies. Four hours later he had a shoebox of memorabilia from that long ago leave, a small check for a couple thousand dollars, and a name: Alexander Lavell Harris.<p>When he got back to Colorado he gave Carter what he knew and let her work her magic while life settled back into its normal routine of missions and near death experiences. In her spare time, what little of it there was, Carter searched every file she could get her hands on, but with hard records destroyed and internet ones secure and often out of date, it was very slow going.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack spent the time he wasn't yelling at Daniel wondering what Alexander, or Alex as he'd nicknamed him in his head, was like.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Six months later, Carter found an address.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>\"Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?\" Daniel asked for the thousandth time as he watched Jack pack for his trip to Cleveland.<p>And for the thousandth time, Jack shook his head. \"I'm sure,\" he said with finality, hoping Danny would get the point this time. But he didn't.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Jack, it's no problem. And you might want to have a friend around for this.\" Daniel's eyes caught his and held them. \"It's not going to be easy.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I know, Daniel,\" Jack sighed and scrubbed his face. \"But the General needs you here for the . . .\" he floundered his hand around searching for the name of their latest diplomatic crises.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yibbites. Jack, just be careful, okay?\" said Daniel. \"Don't be all . . .\" This time Daniel searched for words.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Be what?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Daniel sighed. \"Just remember your going to be telling Alex that his mother and the man he thought was his father are dead. And that you are his biological father from a one night stand with his mom.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack focused on packing. \"It wasn't one night,\" he grumbled, not liking what his friend was telling him, but knowing Daniel was right. He couldn't just waltz in and expect Alex to welcome him with open arms. And that's what he was afraid of, being rejected and cast away. That's why Daniel wanted to come and why Jack didn't want him there. If that happened, he wanted time to mourn. He looked back at Daniel. \"I'll be careful,\" he promised.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Daniel nodded and followed him out the door to the car.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>Jack was nervous. He stared at the house in front of him wondering just what the hell he was doing there. It was an old house that was tucked away in a nice quiet older neighborhood of Cleveland. But it looked how a nice house should. Was Alex married? Did he have kids? Oh God, did he have kids? Jack didn't think he could cope with grandkids on top of everything.<p>No. He didn't know anything. That's why he was here, to find out about his son. Six months and he still wasn't completely used to the idea. Shaking off whatever paralysis had come over him, Jack got out of his rental and made his way up the drive. Noise came from the backyard but it sounded harmless enough that he ignored it for the moment and just went up the steps to the ring the bell, listening as it echoed inside. A dozen sets of footsteps followed with overlapping cries of \"I'll get it,\" and suddenly the door was pulled open and Jack found himself faced with three teenage girls.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Surprised, he took a light step back. This was not what he had been expecting. All three had brown hair and were waiting for him to speak, clearly as surprised as he was to see him standing there. \"Hi,\" Jack kind of waved, off balance. He had double-checked the address twice.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No pizza?\" the girl in the middle asked with a slight lift of her eyebrows that quickly settled into a disappointed frown when Jack shook his head.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Ah, no. Actually I'm here to see Mr. Harris,\" he told them.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What for?\" demanded the one on the right. Jack looked from her to the others and saw that they all had narrowed their eyes at him. Over their shoulders Jack saw two more girls poke their heads around a doorjamb. What was going on here?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Uh, I'm actually here with news about his parents,\" he focused back on the rightside girl. She gave him a quick once over then stepped back, the other girls also moving aside for him to enter.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"XANDER!!!\" she yelled at the top of her lungs, making Jack startle back at the noise.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\" a voice floated down from the second floor. His son's voice he realized. Alex \xE2\x80\x93 wait, the girl had called him Xander. His name was Xander. The girl yelled again before he could process that thought further.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"SOMEONE'S HERE TO SEE YOU!!!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Coming!\" Xander called down. Jack watched the upper rail of the second floor that showed the upper hallway above him, barely noticing as the girls drifted back to whatever it was girls did here. He didn't have to wait long. He recognized him from the picture Carter had found as the tall young man slowly descended the stairs. Except he had an eyepatch over his left eye. And his hair was longer. Why did he have an eyepatch over his left eye?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey,\" said Xander as he reached the last step. He was wearing blue jeans and a green t-shirt under a workman's vest. His son was a construction worker, a foreman, he remembered. Jack clasped the offered hand with a smile, suddenly feeling like he'd been given too much air to breathe. \"I'm Xander Harris. What can I do for you?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>It was only then that Jack noticed the wary look in his single eye, the way he stepped back slightly after their handshake ended. It was disappointing that he was a stranger to his own son, but Jack knew better than to have hoped otherwise.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Jack O'Neill,\" he introduced himself. \"I've got news about your parents.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"My parents, huh?\" Xander blinked. \"They're dead, aren't they?\" He was not surprised. It was as if Jack had only confirmed what he'd known all along. Jack noticed a blond head this time listening at the doorjamb.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Can we talk somewhere?\" he asked, motioning toward their eavesdropper. Xander turned his whole head so he could see where Jack meant, then nodded and turned to an open sitting room on the right. He closed the doors and motioned for Jack to sit, settling on the beat up couch opposite him. Jack just watched him for a moment, taking him in, trying to readjust his image to fit this calm young man with one eye in working clothes. He didn't know what he had expected, but this wasn't it. \"You knew about your parents?\" he heard himself ask cautiously.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Xander looked away, to the right, to the floor. \"I was in LA during the riots. They were in my uncle's neighborhood. I didn't know for sure . . .\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You were there?\" Jack asked surprised.</p>\r\n\
    <p>But Xander shook his head. \"I was staying with some friends downtown. So do you work for the city or something? You could have just called.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No,\" said Jack looking down at his hands. Oh, God, how was he going to do this? \"The, uh, Clerk's Office called me. I knew your mother a long time ago, and I was mentioned in the Will.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Huh?\" His son's calm face broke in surprise, but he waited for Jack to go on.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I knew her before you were born,\" Jack repeated. \"The Clerk's Office couldn't find you so they gave me your name when I said I could track you down.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"They did?\" Xander still looked confused, but then his mouth clicked shut and his eyes single eye bore into Jack's. \"Why? They don't usually release that kind if information to strangers. Who are you?\" This last was said with suspicion. He had tensed up, ready to spring into action at the slightest provocation, and though Jack knew the kid wouldn't be able to touch him, it still hurt.</p>\r\n\
    <p>He reached into his pocket and offered his son his birth certificate. Xander glanced at it, back at Jack, then really read it. His hands started to shake and Jack wondered what would happen next. Wondered if he was going to get thrown out.</p>\r\n\
    <p>When Xander looked up at him again there was only anger. \"What is this?\" he demanded, low and dangerous.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I just found out about it, too,\" said Jack, looking away from that one terrible eye.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"These can be forged, you know.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It was in her Will for you to know.\" He reached into his pocket again for the pictures. There were only two, both of him and Jessica standing together in front of the beach house. Xander looked at them closely, his index finger brushing over the young faces as if her could reach out and bring them back. He sniffed and stood, and when he glanced at Jack on his way to the door, his eye was brighter than it should have been.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"DAWN!\" he shouted and not two seconds later the brunette who had challenged Jack at the door stuck her head in the door.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah?\" she chirped, eyes slipping past him to land on Jack.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Go check if these are real,\" Xander handed her the birth certificate and the pictures.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What?\" Dawn looked at them then his son in confusion before reading the birth certificate. \"Xander!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dawn, just do it. Please,\" his son asked tiredly. The girl looked at Jack again before nodding and leaving them to an uncomfortable silence.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack wondered how she would know if they were real or not and was suddenly angered by the whole situation. Angry at Jessica for not telling him about Xander, angry at Xander for not trusting him or even his evidence. How the hell was a fifteen-year-old going to verify that they were real anyway?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"She's seventeen,\" said Xander sharply, turning to glare at him. Had he said that out loud?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Sorry, seventeen,\" said Jack sarcastically. As if it made a difference. \"You're just going to take the word of a seventeen-year-old that that birth certificate is real?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Or forged,\" said Xander coldly.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It's not forged.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"We'll see.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How? Is she going to wave her little magic wand?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Something like that.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>They stared at each other, neither one willing to back down for several minutes. His son's arms were crossed across his chest almost like Daniel's protective stance but somehow more dangerous. Maybe it was the eyepatch, or the shaggy head of hair.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You look a little like my uncle when he was young,\" Jack surprised them both by saying. Xander blinked and the hard expression melted to something like curiosity. Maybe if he could accept it, they could be friends. \"I'm sorry for . . .\" Jack paused looking for what he was sorry for. Not being there, not loving him, not playing ball, or meeting his girl, and for all of a sudden dropping this on his shoulders after he found out his parents were dead. Daniel was right; this was far from easy. \"For, you know, everything,\" he finished lamely.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Xander?\" Dawn's quiet voice interrupted the tense silence. They both turned and she looked from one to the other, eyes slightly wide. \"They're real.\" She held out the pictures and birth certificate. After a stunned moment, Xander took them.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Thanks, Dawnie,\" he said staring at them, processing. Dawn looked at Jack again before ducking out and closing the door.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack waited for Xander to acknowledge him, and when he finally looked up there were tears in his eye. He smiled weakly. \"Sorry. I guess it's just hitting me that I'm never going to see Mom again.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry,\" Jack said again.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Xander smiled tightly. \"Thanks.\" They stared at each other again but this time his son was studying him. \"So I guess we should do the bonding thing,\" Xander finally broke the silence.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack smiled in relief. He wasn't going to be kicked out of the house after all. He had a chance here to make it work with this child he didn't know. Once they resettled into chairs and the sofa, Xander began.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So you married?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>He didn't waste any time with the easy stuff. \"Divorced,\" said Jack. \"I got married about a year after I left your mom,\" he went on. It felt weird to explain something that he normally kept close to his heart. But if anyone deserved to know it was the young man before him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Any kids?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack closed his eyes and nodded. \"Charlie.\" He opened them and gazed at Xander's work boots. \"He accidentally shot himself with my gun when he was ten. Sarah and I couldn't make it through his death.\" He could still remember that day as if it were yesterday. He'd never forgive himself.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm sorry,\" Xander almost whispered. There was no anger, no judgement, only pain when Jack met his eye, though he had a feeling that Xander wasn't seeing him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What about you?\" asked Jack. \"Do you have a girlfriend?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No, no girlfriend,\" Xander came back from wherever he had gone. \"She . . .she's gone.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"And all these girls around here?\" Jack felt the need to lighten the mood. How had they managed to pick the one subject that left them both depressed?</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Are unfortunately not my personal harem,\" Xander grinned suddenly. \"They'd all kick my ass from here to England.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack smiled at the thought. \"So what do you do here?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Me and a couple of friends are running a self-defense program for girls for the summer,\" Xander waved his hand at the house in general. \"After Sunnydale, we needed to get out of California. So we ended up here, with no money, and one hair-brained idea.\" He shrugged. \"My friends do the teaching. I'm more of the fix-whatever-gets-broken-guy.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>The doorbell rang and a stampede of footsteps rushed to the door followed soon after by the smell of pizza, which made Xander grin hesitantly, his hands rubbing against his legs with nervous energy. \"Food's here. You want?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack followed his son to the kitchen where thirty girls were attacking as many pizza boxes on the counter. Most of them were dressed in workout clothes and all of them were talking. As Jack watched his son melt into the rush of youth he couldn't help but notice that he was more than Mr. Fix- it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Xander! Allison took two pieces of cheese and I didn't get any!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Allison, give one to Vi!\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"'S not fair!\" the girl in question grumbled as Xander fixed his eye on her.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, who took my drink?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Xander, where are the napkins?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Ask Ellie and Veronica, they're on kitchen duty for lunch.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"No we're not!\" two girls protested with matching looks of innocence. Jack watched as Xander simply raised his eyebrow.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Do I have to check the list?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Fine, we'll find them,\" one of the girls grumbled stomping off to the cabinets.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, Xander, is this your dad?\" Jack suddenly found thirty pairs of eyes fixed on him. He felt like he was facing a squad of piranhas that would tear him to pieces at any second.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I thought your dad died.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"That was his mom's husband who he grew up with. This is his biological dad.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Really? Are you sure?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Dawn said so.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey, all I said was the papers were for real.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Hey!\" Xander's voice cut through all the speculation. He didn't seem too surprised or bothered that word had gotten out in the span of ten minutes, though Jack had a feeling he himself looked shell-shocked. Who wouldn't? He was used to handling only one teenage girl at a time, not thirty, for cryin' out loud.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Everyone, this is Jack O'Neill. Jack, this is almost everyone.\" He leaned in close and whispered, \"Don't let them scare you,\" in his ear and handed him a paper plate with two slices of pepperoni. Xander shouldered room for them at the counter and then the interrogation began.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"So where you from?\" Dawn was the first to ask, squeezing in next to him at the counter.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Colorado,\" said Jack, feeling a little bit better once he took a bite of pizza.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Colorado? Isn't Terry from Colorado?\" someone asked, but since Terry wasn't there to confirm this, Dawn moved on.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What do you do?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I'm in the Air Force.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Really?\" several girls asked. \"Do you fly planes?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack turned to the waiting crowd. \"Sometimes. Not as much anymore.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Air Force, huh?\" Dawn poked his arm to get his attention. \"Name, rank, and serial number.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack grinned at the narrow look she was giving him and rattled off the information. There was an impressed collected gasp when he said 'Colonel,' but when he glanced at Xander, his son had that wary look back in his eye. Jack sighed internally, frustrated that whatever ground he had gained seemed to have been lost.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You don't happen to work on any top secret projects, do you?\" asked Xander. And from the way he said it, Jack knew he was only half-joking. And that scared him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Deep space radar telemetry,\" the practiced lie rolled off his lips. What did Xander know about top secret projects? He was just a kid! His kid. Oh God, his kid! Jack wanted to grab his shoulder and demand answers, but he couldn't, not here in front of all these little girls. Not with a son he wanted a chance with.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Feeling dazed he turned back to the questions the girls kept asking. Do you have a gun? Have you been in a war? Have any of your friends died? Vaguely he recognized something strange in the questions, but preoccupied by what had prompted Xander's question, he couldn't tell what. It took him five minutes to notice that Dawn had disappeared.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Finally, Xander shooed the girls away and they went back to the sitting room and the dilapidated couch. His son regarded him strangely before speaking. \"I didn't mean to wig you out,\" he said. \"It's just . . .this guy one of my friends dated was in the Army. It was a bad break up.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>He didn't say anymore, but Jack got the feeling that bad was an understatement. \"I'm sorry to hear that.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Xander shrugged again. \"So deep space radar telemetry? That sounds . . .fun.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, if you're asleep. And you're a construction worker?\" he asked to change the subject away from issues of national security.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Used to be. Now I'm an out of work, one-eyed carpenter.\" Jack could tell he wasn't happy about it.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"What about this?\" he asked, gesturing to the house.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"It's more my friends' stuff than mine,\" Xander smiled sadly. \"Being a carpenter was all mine, you know?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Jack found himself smiling too, understanding the need to have something that you alone were good at. \"So . . . can I ask what happened? To your eye?\" Jack almost held his breath, waiting to see if Xander would let him in.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"You know how they say 'never run with scissors'?\" Xander finally said. \"It's good advice.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Oh,\" Jack looked away. Something was missing. He didn't know what it was, but he knew a recent wound when he saw one. Xander just wasn't ready to talk about it yet. At least he hoped that was the case, and that one day his son would feel comfortable talking about it with him.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"How long are you staying?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Till Saturday.\" It was Thursday today, so two more days. He wondered if he would be seeing more of Xander. \"Id like to get to know you though. See you again,\" he added, hoping he didn't sound too desperate. \"If I had known, I would have come.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Really?\" Xander sounded like he didn't believe him. \"You barely knew my mother.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Wouldn't matter.\" Jack held his gaze, willing the words to sink in. Xander sat there, still skeptical. \"Will you give me a chance?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"I've got to go check on the girls.\" Xander didn't answer the question. \"Do you have a place to stay?\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>Jack nodded. \"Hampton Inn.\" They both stood up no longer sure what to say to each other. \"So I'll see you tomorrow?\" asked Jack hopefully.</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Yeah,\" Xander nodded. \"I've got to pick up Buffy and Giles from the airport. They'll want to meet you. If you can come around four? That way they'll have time to interrogate you before dinner.\"</p>\r\n\
    <p>\"Four then,\" said Jack. He didn't like the sound of interrogation. There would probably be questions about his intentions toward Xander, death threats, that sort of thing. And Jack realized as Xander awkwardly shook his hand at the door that in an odd way he was looking forward to it.</p>\r\n\
    <hr>Let me know what you think. Good, bad, ugly?"

    The door is very loud as it closes behind him, and Dean shrinks further into himself, away from her reaching hand.
    
    "It's okay, Dean." Her voice sounds sweet but firm, and Dean knows what she really means is <em>You have to stay and do what I tell you</em>. "Your daddy and your baby brother are just going to wait right outside while we talk again. Why don't you go sit down in your seat?"
    
    Dean doesn't look up at her, is careful to keep his eyes on the floor all the way to the little plastic chair next to the table. The chair is yellow. The table is red. Dean thinks he'd probably hate them, if he had any hate left over.
    
    She sits down on the floor on the other side of the little table, and Dean shifts his gaze to the table top. There's paper laid out on it, and crayons.
    
    He really, really wishes Daddy hadn't made him come back here again.
    
    "Now then," she says, "why don't we start by drawing something that's happened this week? Can you do that, Dean? Draw me something you've done, or something you've seen, or something you've thought about since the last time we saw each other. Okay?"
    
    Dean stares at the pieces of paper and doesn't move.
    
    "I'll go first, then," she says, and picks up one of the crayons. "Yesterday..." She sketches quickly as she speaks, drawing the words out. "I spoke to my father." Green and red and yellow. Dean doesn't look.
    
    "Now then, your turn," she says. Dean feels her eyes on him and lowers his head further.
    
    <em>She wants to help you</em>, Daddy had said. <em>Be good, Dean. Do what she tells you</em>.
    
    He doesn't want to draw, doesn't want to show her any part of him. But he picks up one of the crayons and draws a piece of paper towards him. It takes him a moment to decide what his picture should be, because he's not going to draw Sammy or Daddy, not for her. Finally he draws a cake, quick and messy.
    
    "Ah, yes, it was your birthday this week, wasn't it, Dean?" He can hear the smile in her voice. "Did you have candles on your cake?"
    
    There had been candles. Mrs Jones had baked him a birthday cake and put candles on it, and he'd stared at them when she lit them, tiny golden flames. He hadn't eaten any of his cake.
    
    "Okay, good," she says. "I'd like you to draw me a picture of the fire, now. The fire from that night."
    
    Dean puts his crayon down.
    
    "Dean," she says. Her voice is firm again. "You can either tell me about what you saw that night, or you can draw it. It's up to you."
    
    He stares at the table and shivers. He can't tell her, doesn't know where the words have gone, and wouldn't give them to her even if he did. He doesn't want to draw this for her either.
    
    <em>Be good, Dean.</em>
    
    Slowly he picks up the yellow crayon, and hears her draw in breath.
    
    The flames he draws are sharp and jagged, yellow then orange then red, filling the page. He focuses on the crayons and tries not to look.
    
    "That's good," she says. "But it's not all. You saw something else that night, didn't you? Draw it for me, Dean."
    
    He saw a lot of things that night, things he doesn't like remembering - saw his home vanish, saw his Daddy cry. Saw...
    
    "Draw it for me," she insists.
    
    Dean swallows, and picks up the yellow crayon again. Fiddles with the edge of a flame, biting his lip.
    
    "I see lots of cases like yours," she tells him, her voice lower. "Families ripped apart by fires. But none of them had - you're unique, Dean, do you know what that means?"
    
    <em>You're special</em>, Mommy used to say. <em>You're special, Dean. So you've got to be careful.</em>
    
    "Special is one word for it." He knows if he looks up she'll be smiling again. "You're different. You break all the patterns. And I want to know why."
    
    He looks up at her.
    
    The table almost topples over as he scrambles to his feet, and then he's running for the door, reaching up for the handle. He can hear his own breathing, frantic little gasps as he struggles with the door, and then it's open and he's out and he doesn't stop running until he collides with Daddy's legs.
    
    "Whoa, easy, Dean," Daddy says, his hand coming down to touch Dean's head. He stands up, and Dean immediately slips behind him, hiding as best he can, because he can hear the <em>tap tap</em> of her footsteps coming closer.
    
    "Is he -?"
    
    "It's really a good sign," she says. "Children react to grief in all sorts of ways, and if he's starting to express that rather than locking it inside himself, that's real progress."
    
    Dean clings on to Daddy's legs, and wisheswisheswishes Mommy was here.
    
    "I'd like to see Dean again in a week," she tells Daddy. "Please make an appointment with my assistant on your way out."
    
    "Okay," Daddy says. "Thank you for your time. C'mon, Dean, time to go."
    
    Dean lets Daddy take his hand and draw him out of the room, then Daddy sets Sammy's carrier down, and Dean stays close to it while Daddy goes across to talk to the man at the desk.
    
    <em>So you've got to be careful. And if you see anyone with black eyes, you run, Dean. You run and you find me and you tell me right away, do you understand?</em>
    
    "All set," Daddy says, picking Sammy's carrier up again. "Let's go."
    
    Dean follows silently, because he doesn't know what else to do. He can't run and tell Mommy, not any more.
    
    He <em>really</em> wishes Mommy was here.

  content: "<h3>June 2005</h3><br /><br />The first thing Xander learned about puppies was that they had to pee every two hours, day or night, and if they couldn&#8217;t hose down the grass, they had no problem going wherever they were when nature called.  Xander had this running phone conversation in his head to Jack where he complained about that and the chewing and the utter inability of the little runt to learn how to heel.  In the last week alone, he&#8217;d walked probably a mile in circles around the back yard until Buffy had yelled at him about distracting the girls.  Xander had read more dog training books in the last two weeks than demonologies, which, considering he led three sessions a day on How To Figure Out What You&#8217;re Dealing With, was pretty remarkable.  He&#8217;d tried the choke collar, he&#8217;d tried the dog treats, he&#8217;d tried everything short of yelling which is what he wanted to do but that all the dog books said it was a bad idea, and he still couldn&#8217;t get the dog to heel.<br /><br />&#8220;He&#8217;s just a baby, Xander,&#8221; Christa, fourteen and a self-described dog trainer, said.  &#8220;He sits and stays, and he&#8217;s handling the Long Down okay, aren&#8217;t you, Ace?  Aren&#8217;t you just so cute and wonderful?&#8221;  At the center of attention, Ace&#8217;s tail thwapped excitedly on the floor as Christa ruffled his ears.<br /><br />&#8220;Ace, down,&#8221; Xander said before he got any ideas.  They were twenty minutes into the half hour of enforced stillness at the end of another long day of Slayer Camp.  &#8220;Good boy.&#8221;  For all the frustration an excited puppy was in a full house, he was pretty cute and wonderful.<br /><br />&#8220;They like it when you say it excited like a question,&#8221; said Christa.<br /><br />&#8220;Good boy?&#8221; asked Hillary from the couch behind them.  They were in the den in front of the new dancing <i>American Idol</i> show, girls packed like sardines on the couch, the armchairs, whatever was stolen from the dining room, and most of the floor space.  Christa had snagged the best spot in the house on Ace&#8217;s other side, chatting training techniques during the ads to a rapt audience.<br /><br />That was the second thing Xander had learned about puppies: with a couple of exceptions, girls loved puppies and would do just about anything to keep puppy playing privileges.  With things this summer in more upheaval than normal, it was one extra weapon Xander had for his side.<br /><br />&#8220;What a good boy you are!?&#8221; Christa demonstrated, making everyone laugh and Ace thump his tail wildly.  There followed a chorus of praise disguised as questions until Ace couldn&#8217;t stand it any more and jumped up to lick the nearest face, Christa&#8217;s of course.  Xander checked his watch.  Twenty three minutes.  Not bad for a roomful of eager distractions.<br /><br />&#8220;Ace, down,&#8221; Xander grabbed the puppy and put him back into place, ignoring the giggles around the room.  &#8220;You should all be ashamed of yourselves, corrupting the young,&#8221; Xander told the girls in his best mock severe voice, getting even more giggles in reply.  It was mostly the younger set up here, the thirteen and fourteen year olds who sometimes got driven off by the high schoolers from the basement and the absolute privacy of the tv down there.  Xander didn&#8217;t want to know and made a point of only going downstairs if he was specifically invited to fix a problem.<br /><br />Once Ace had settled somewhat, Xander released him and let him bound off.  The books were always very adamant about that, making sure that your puppy knew he still had to listen to you.<br /><br />&#8220;Are you going to teach him to be an attack dog?&#8221; asked Becky.  Ace bounced from girl to girl, licking and nosing and wiggling happily.  He was so innocent and didn&#8217;t have a mean bone in his body.  Thinking of him putting himself in danger, a weapon, scared Xander in the same way that sending these kids out into battle did.  More so, because Ace was tiny and helpless and not built to take a beating.  That was the part of the phone conversation to Jack that Xander left out.  He had a feeling his dad knew how much he loved Ace without it being said anyway.<br /><br />&#8220;I gotta teach him to heel first,&#8221; Xander answered.  Jerry Cho said he had a friend who worked with police dogs if Xander was interested, and had brought up the point that given his proximity to a life high in violence, Ace, like the girls, was probably better off trained.  <br /><br />Jerry was a good guy, and Xander had certainly thought about his offer.  Dawn had found his karate studio last year when she&#8217;d wanted more training that wasn&#8217;t designed for slayers.  Jerry was sharp and by the end of the year he&#8217;d pieced together enough to be dangerous so Dawn had made an executive decision to see if he would help them instead of turn them over to social services.  It was the best decision she had made.  Once the Council money came through, Xander offered him a summer contract to put the technique behind the brute strength of the slayers.  The results had been impressive after he knocked the older girls down a peg or two, even Buffy who for once had the grace to be a good example and not complain about it where anyone but Xander could hear.  It was not long after that that Jerry was teaching Buffy how to teach better and taking in Xander and Andrew for human sized lessons.<br /><br />The last five minutes of the show was back on and the girls settled down to watch the final words from the judges.  Ace had made it to Kelly&#8217;s lap and was contentedly getting his belly rubbed, tired at last from a busy day.  On his left, Courtney leaned a little bit more against Xander&#8217;s shoulder, resting her head.  That was the third thing Xander had learned about puppies: that they had enough energy to keep up with slayers but, like slayers, when they crashed, they crashed hard.<br /><br />The show wound down, the voting lines opened, and while the girls fished for cell phones, Xander went and retrieved Ace who licked his face in greeting when Xander picked him up.  &#8220;Lights out in an hour,&#8221; he said, getting only a few absent hand waves in acknowledgement.  He wasn&#8217;t worried.  They would whine and complain and pretend to ignore him for however long it took for them to cycle through the bathrooms, but they&#8217;d more or less be in bed in an hour.  Good kids, every one.<br /><br />&#8220;Come on you,&#8221; Xander rubbed his cheek against Ace&#8217;s soft puppy fur and took him outside.<br /> <br /><hr /><h3>July 2005</h3><br /><br />The first day was the hardest.  It was Jack and eight little girls set up in the sitting room paying attention as Jack talked about how many people died every year from accidental gunshot wounds.<br /><br />It had been a hell of a phone call.  Jack had picked up, glad to hear Xander on the other end, catching up about life and slayer camp and then bam, &#8220;Hey I have a topic that I need your help with.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Sure, what is it?&#8221;<br /><br />Xander paused, long enough for a truck to drive through the hole in the conversation.  &#8220;So Mae&#8217;s dad thought she should learn how to shoot a gun, to protect herself now that she has super strength.  Just in case.  Anyway, I was thinking that it might not be a bad idea for everyone to at least know what to do if they find a gun.&#8221;  He had trailed off and Jack had stayed quiet.  He could hear the blood rushing in his ears as he struggled to find something to say.  <br /><br />Jack&#8217;s knee-jerk reaction had been, &#8220;Are you nuts?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Look, I know you lost Charlie.  I know what it&#8217;s like to lose someone to a stray bullet by some dumbass,&#8221; said Xander grimly.  &#8220;I&#8217;m just worried that some vampire will be smart enough to take a shot or something, or one of the girls goes after a mugger thinking she&#8217;s invincible and suddenly there&#8217;s a gun on the ground and too many people grabbing for it.&#8221;<br /><br />The silence had been long and heavy but Jack had said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;  God help him, he understood that terrible what if of a kid not knowing what to do with a gun.<br /><br />Cleveland was chaos.  When he saw the weekly schedule, it reminded Jack of boot camp: conditioning, training, classes on hand to hand fighting and weapons, tactics, field medicine.  The weapons just happened to be medieval, the tactics for taking on different monsters, and the field medicine skewed toward girls with abnormal healing ability.  And there were arts and crafts and tv time and cookie making duty and team names that resembled bands.<br /><br />&#8220;Are you sure I can&#8217;t send you some of my Marines?&#8221; he&#8217;d asked after watching Xander break up a fight that started because &#8220;She <i>looked</i> at me!&#8221; and which led to tears and two patrol teams with their backs up that clearly were in the running of some competition that no one else knew about.<br /><br />&#8220;Eighth graders!&#8221; Dawn had rolled her eyes expressively to Jack when she passed, corralling the rest of the girls into their nightly duties of KP, monster research, or patrol while Xander handled World War Three.  Jack sat back and played with Ace and thought about how he was going to peel back another layer of innocence from these kids in the coming week.<br /><br />That&#8217;s what made the first day the hardest, knowing that he was taking the fantastic world of slayers and magic and firmly entrenching it in the gritty, human side of life and death.<br /><br />&#8220;This week&#8217;s safety class is to make sure that if you encounter a gun you know how to handle it safely and that you don&#8217;t accidentally shoot someone.&#8221;  Jack paused to look each girl in the eye.  They each looked back, just as seriously.  It was a striking contrast to the usual giggles and laughter, reinforced by the smattering of half faded bruises from the morning&#8217;s martial arts.  Jack didn&#8217;t insult them by reminding them that guns were not toys, though he dearly wanted to.<br /><br />&#8220;Any of you held a gun before?&#8221; he asked instead.  Two of the girls raised their hands.<br /><br />&#8220;Just a rifle,&#8221; said Maggie, her accent putting her from somewhere with lots of corn.  &#8220;My dad and my brother hunt and I almost killed a rabbit once.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;My friend&#8217;s brother has one,&#8221; said Abi when Jack turned to her next.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t look at me like that,&#8221; she said defensively.  &#8220;I&#8217;m from New York.  My school has metal detectors.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack nodded once and let it go.  There was more than one way to lose innocence after all, and for all its smallness, it was still a big world out there.<br /><br />He started the lesson in earnest after that, starting with a brief discussion of the guns they might encounter and their capabilities.  He didn&#8217;t have a full blown PowerPoint presentation, but he did show them pictures of both the guns and the damage they did to a dummy.  Jack didn&#8217;t falter when he talked about the 9mm handgun, but he thought about Charlie and wondered why his boy had thought it would be okay to look at it that day.  He&#8217;d known better.  Jack had talked to him like he was talking to these girls now.  He&#8217;d known better.<br /><br />Christ, what was he doing here?<br /><br />He was here because Xander asked him to come and help keep his girls safe.  And as much as he hated it, knowing was better than being unprepared.<br /><br />Jack had four more sessions today, and tomorrow he&#8217;d bring out the weapons he&#8217;d brought and teach the girls how to dismantle and clean them.  By the end of the week they&#8217;d learn how to shoot.<br /><br />When the hour was over and the girls had filed out, Jack stayed behind for just a moment.  The door to the sitting room creaked open a few minutes later, and Jack didn&#8217;t need to look up to know it was Xander settling in beside him.<br /><br />&#8220;Thanks for this,&#8221; his son said quietly.<br /><br />Jack sighed and lifted his head from his hands.  &#8220;I just hope they&#8217;re wise enough to handle it,&#8221; he said.<br /><br />&#8220;They are.&#8221;  The assurance was confident and unhesitant.  That had to be enough for Jack.  &#8220;They know it&#8217;s not a game.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack nodded again and scrubbed a hand over his head briefly.  He wasn&#8217;t letting it go, he couldn&#8217;t, but he had made a choice and he was going to see through.<br /><br />&#8220;Hey,&#8221; Xander backhanded his shoulder. &#8220;What do you say we skip dinner here and go out to eat?  I could use a break from all this madness.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack wondered who Xander thought he was fooling and almost laughed when he turned up an innocent smile.  &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Jack said.  Fooled or not, a quiet place where they could chat in peace would be nice.  &#8220;Let&#8217;s do that.&#8221;<br /> <br /><hr /><h3>August 2005</h3><br /><br />There was something soothing about doing the budget when there was money to spend.  Household food &#8211; check.  Gas and water &#8211; check and check.  Salaries for him, Andrew, and Diana &#8211; check, check, and check.  Xander couldn&#8217;t help but grin at the nice chunk of change and the bonus Giles was giving them for getting through last year on a Home Depot salary.  <br /><br />The Council money had been well managed over the centuries and had been left untouched by the First.  New income was generated from both interest and the various consulting firms that were fronts for the Council and did actually do business with the rest of the world who thought simply that they were a historical society preserving the world&#8217;s myths and legends in excruciating detail.  There were art galleries and museums and various other things in there that even Giles hadn&#8217;t gotten to the bottom of yet.  The poor man was understaffed and overworked which explained why he&#8217;d given Xander a ton of money and carte blanche to managing it for the North American Slayers.  It was a daunting task.<br /><br />When the phone rang, Andrew went to answer it.  &#8220;It&#8217;s your dad,&#8221; he said upon returning and passing the handset to Xander.<br /><br />&#8220;Jack!&#8221;  Xander was happy to hear from him.  Jack had missed last week&#8217;s phone call and he&#8217;d been a little worried.<br /><br />&#8220;Hey, kiddo,&#8221; said Jack.  &#8220;How you doing?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Great.  How are you?  I didn&#8217;t hear from you last week.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, you know, it&#8217;s been busy.  A few snakes, a reenactment of <i>The Little Shop of Horrors</i>, a presidential visit.  I almost quit my job.&#8221;<br /><br />Xander laughed.  Jack had said that every time they&#8217;d talked since his promotion.  If Xander thought that having an Air Force colonel for a dad was weird, it was doubly weird him being a general.  &#8220;I&#8217;m assuming you didn&#8217;t?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Someone has to pick out the bunting,&#8221; was Jack&#8217;s flip reply.  &#8220;How are things in Girl Land?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Girls are all home now.  Left yesterday,&#8221; said Xander.  &#8220;The house is all eerie and quiet.  Dawn left two weeks ago with Buffy on their training tour of Europe.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Training tour?  That&#8217;s not some weird bicycle thing is it?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No,&#8221; Xander chuckled.  &#8220;Buffy hasn&#8217;t set up a home base yet &#8211; there wasn&#8217;t any money last year &#8211; so she&#8217;s been going slayer to slayer to give them the rundown and basic training.  Dawn&#8217;s gonna help with the language barrier thing and get in some sisterly bonding.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I though Dawn was going to Oxford,&#8221; said Jack.<br /><br />&#8220;She is but she&#8217;s putting it off a year so she can spend time with Buffy doing this first.  Vi&#8217;s going too but she&#8217;s not leaving till next week.  Then it&#8217;s really going to be quiet around here.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Just the three of you left?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Us and Ace,&#8221; Xander grinned at Jack&#8217;s annoyed huff.  He hated the name Xander had picked for his puppy, though Xander had a feeling it was mostly for show.<br /><br />&#8220;I got the last pictures you sent.  Looks like he&#8217;s happily chewing his way through everything in sight.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You could have warned me,&#8221; Xander retorted.  He&#8217;d lost two shoes of different pairs and the handle of his favorite ax to Ace&#8217;s teeth, and had the photographic evidence to prove it wasn&#8217;t the Garg-whatsits Andrew was convinced had invaded.  <br /><br />&#8220;You know, I think I did,&#8221; said Jack smugly.  &#8220;I seem to recall telling you Ace would eat your room if you didn&#8217;t clean it up.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Okay, first of all, that hardly counts because how was I supposed to know you meant that literally?  I&#8217;ve never had a dog before.  Second of all, will you quit bitching about my room?  It has a very easy organization system and cleaning it would jut mess that up.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Your organizational system nearly killed me on the way to the bathroom.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Just because you can&#8217;t control your bladder in the middle of the night . . .&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh shut up,&#8221; said Jack but without much heat.  Xander laughed.  They&#8217;d been having this argument since Jack had visited.  He&#8217;d stayed in Xander&#8217;s new room &#8211; the old office &#8211; while Xander had temporarily moved back in with Andrew.  &#8220;So what are you up to now that the girls are all leaving the nest?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Trying to figure out what to do with all the money Giles gave us,&#8221; said Xander, glancing back at the table where the computer and official papers were spread out.  &#8220;We have all these funds that used to go toward Watcher salaries that we want to put toward the slayers, but we don&#8217;t want to just give them the money, especially if they&#8217;re not active.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What did Giles say?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;To figure something out.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What about some sort of trust fund?  That way it would go to them, but they couldn&#8217;t spend it for a while,&#8221; Jack suggested.<br /><br />&#8220;Willow was thinking of something like that,&#8221; Xander nodded.  &#8220;She was thinking an education allowance.  They&#8217;re dealing with a lot of poor kids in South and Central America who aren&#8217;t even in school.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Maybe for the girls here you could gear it more toward college?  Or even the option of private schools for some of them.  Get them out of the public system where it&#8217;s bad.&#8221;<br /><br />Xander grabbed a pen and scribbled a note to himself.  It was a good idea.  Public education wasn&#8217;t all it was cracked up to be, even in suburbia.  &#8220;Jerry wants everyone to find a dojo and keep training too.  I was thinking of allocating a bit for that.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Keeping up with those skills is important,&#8221; sighed Jack, and Xander knew just from that that he was thinking, <i>they&#8217;re kids.  They shouldn&#8217;t have to keep up with skills like those</i>.  It was another old argument, one of the first in fact, one that Xander had won.  They didn&#8217;t talk about it directly anymore.<br /><br />Hearing Jack&#8217;s weariness, Xander asked softly, &#8220;How&#8217;s the team?&#8221;  Jack never let on, but Xander knew taking over the base command had meant giving up something special.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re fine,&#8221; said Jack with fondness and forced cheer.<br /><br />&#8220;Well, say hi for me when you see them.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I will.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;And Dad?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah?<br /><br />&#8220;They&#8217;re still your friends, you know.  You can still have them over for dinner.&#8221;  Xander could hear Jack rolling his eyes over the phone.<br /><br />&#8220;Yes, mom.  We&#8217;ll have milk and cookies too, just as soon as we finish our homework.&#8221;<br /><br />Laughing, Xander fell into more easy banter, amazed again that he had this.<br /><br /> <br /><hr /><h3>September 2005</h3><br /><br />&#8220;Seriously though, this looks like congealed barf.&#8221;  Diana ignored Xander&#8217;s glare along with his previous warning.  &#8220;Where do you come up with this stuff, Andrew?  CSI?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, Diana!&#8221; Xander snapped, not risking a glance at Andrew, devastated, in favor of glaring his remaining slayer into submission.  Diana looked him in the eye and glared back.  Arms crossed across her chest.  Jaw set.<br /><br />&#8220;What?  I just telling him what I thought,&#8221; she said, injured innocence dripping off her like oil.  Xander wanted to slap her but he knew just how effective that would be.<br /><br />&#8220;Grab your coat,&#8221; he said instead, standing.  &#8220;Andrew, I&#8217;m sorry.  Save me some for later, okay. Diana and I are going out.&#8221;  He turned abruptly and barked, &#8220;Now!&#8221; when she didn&#8217;t move.  Diana stared back a moment longer just to make sure he knew that he wasn&#8217;t telling her to do anything, then slowly got to her feet and got her coat.  Andrew wouldn&#8217;t look at him, and Xander did him the courtesy of ignoring the moisture on his cheek as he followed Diana out the front door.<br /><br />She didn&#8217;t say anything and neither did Xander, but she did follow when he started walking.  It was unusual since they normally drove to the evening&#8217;s patrol spot, but since Xander wasn&#8217;t looking to exorcise anything other than whatever crawled up Diana&#8217;s ass and died, he didn&#8217;t really care.  Diana was sullen and quiet as they walked.  And walked.  And walked.  Down to the main road, round the block back into the neighborhood, past the park, left at the Methodist church, and another left at the shopping center back into the neighborhood.  They&#8217;d been going for maybe an hour before Diana finally let out a small annoyed sigh.  Xander circled back to the park and by the time they got there, Diana had relaxed another half an inch.  When he led them to the swings, she sat without prompting and Xander let the silence stretch out a bit longer.<br /><br />Finally he said, &#8220;You want to tell me what that was back there?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What?  I didn&#8217;t do anything other than answer his question,&#8221; Diana replied.  &#8220;Not my fault he cooks weird things.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Right, and insulting the dinner he cooked for you was just an accident,&#8221; said Xander.<br /><br />&#8220;God, I&#8217;m sorry, okay?&#8221; Diana huffed, and even if couldn&#8217;t see it in the dark, the eyeroll was most definitely implied.  &#8220;What do you want from me?  It&#8217;s just dinner.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No, it&#8217;s Andrew and he didn&#8217;t deserve that,&#8221; Xander said evenly.  &#8220;He has enough self esteem issues without you skewering something he takes real pride in.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well boohoo for Andrew.  It&#8217;s not like he can&#8217;t take an insult.  You insult him.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yet I&#8217;m not the one who made him cry.&#8221;<br /><br />Diana looked over and quickly away and didn&#8217;t say anything.  Xander just watched her as she toed the swing back and forth a bit.  One hand on each chain, gripping tight.  &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she said again, but this time she meant it.  &#8220;I . . .&#8221; She didn&#8217;t finish.<br /><br />Xander waited, not sure what to say either.  He thought he knew what was going on but he didn&#8217;t know what would make it better.  Vi and Dawn were off doing their thing with Buffy, happy as a pair of girls touring Europe could be.  &#8220;Look,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s going to be a little different with Dawn and Vi gone.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not jealous,&#8221; said Diana.<br /><br />&#8220;You&#8217;re not?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Why would I be jealous?&#8221; she asked in a close approximation of casual.  &#8220;They&#8217;re stuck with Buffy training slayers.  And we both know how much that sucks.&#8221;  Her smile was less close to genuine.  &#8220;And I&#8217;m here.  With you guys.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Still in high school and in charge of the active hellmouth,&#8221; Xander finished.<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Diana sighed the word, the rest of the fight leaving her.  Crickets chirped and leaves rustled, or whatever the hell they did when sitting outside in silence.  &#8220;Xander, I don&#8217;t think I can do this.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Be Chief Slayer.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What?&#8221; Xander said, surprised.  &#8220;Why?&#8221;  Diana had been with them on the Cleveland Hellmouth since they set up shop after the battle with the First.  She&#8217;d helped pick out the <i>house. </i><br /><br />&#8220;I can&#8217;t keep half the demons I learn about straight,&#8221; she stuck out her thumb, &#8220;I hate research and I&#8217;m bad at it,&#8221; her forefinger, &#8220;I always overcompensate with a sword, I telegraph my left side, I can&#8217;t trick the baddies, I&#8217;m not creative, I can&#8217;t think on my feet, I always go the wrong way in strategy exercises, I can barely count, and I look like a frumpy loser.&#8221; All her fingers used up, she threw up her hands.  &#8220;Hell, I scream when there&#8217;s a spider in the shower.  Some big badass I make.&#8221;<br /><br />Xander blinked.  Blinked again.  She&#8217;d obviously been thinking about this for a while.  &#8220;As a former frumpy loser, can I just say that all that&#8217;s a load of crap?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Xander!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Diana!&#8221; he threw back.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me you believe all that.  It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re describing some pod person.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Xander, you don&#8217;t have to say that to make me feel better.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying anything to make you feel better.  It&#8217;s true.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You know I think I know myself pretty well,&#8221; Diana gave him a scathing look full of teenage derision.<br /><br />&#8220;And I think you&#8217;re just scared and grabbing at any excuse you can find to get out of being in charge.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;All right, fine.  I&#8217;m terrified,&#8221; she yelled, twisting in her swing so she was fully facing him.  &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna screw this up.  I&#8217;m gonna go out one night and I won&#8217;t be fast enough or strong enough or smart enough.  I&#8217;ll do something stupid and get you or Andrew killed.  Then &#8211; &#8221;  Lost and definitely overwhelmed, Diana looked close to tears.  She jerked back when Xander reached out, so he let his hand drop.<br /><br />Xander sighed quietly.  &#8220;It&#8217;s okay to be scared, Diana,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Everyone gets scared.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;But they can handle it.&#8221;  Diana shook a strand of hair out of her eyes impatiently.<br /><br />&#8220;So can you.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Xander . . .&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Diana, you were born to fight <i>vampires</i>.  And you&#8217;re telling me you shouldn&#8217;t be scared?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Not when you put it like that.  Now it just sounds stupid,&#8221; she answered thickly.<br /><br />Xander shook his head, eyes drifting over the grass as he tried to come up with what she needed to hear.  Nothing came to him except memories of a lot of bad decisions.  &#8220;Everyone gets scared,&#8221; he repeated.  &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll screw up.  I&#8217;m not saying you won&#8217;t, because you probably will, but that&#8217;s where me and Andrew come in, like a mushy love song.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Great.  I&#8217;ll drown in syrup,&#8221; Diana said to her feet.<br /><br />&#8220;No.&#8221;  Xander did reach out this time and caught her swing, holding on until she looked at him.  &#8220;You won&#8217;t.&#8221;<br /><br />Diana gave a tiny nod, both too old and too young for the responsibility that came with choosing to fight.  Xander had no idea if she believed him.  No idea what else to say that could maybe get through to her that she wasn&#8217;t alone and that she could handle this.<br /><br />&#8220;I miss my mom,&#8221; she said quietly.<br /><br />Xander looked away and gave her a little space, utterly devoid of words.  There was nothing he could ever say to make that better.  Instead, when Diana slid her hand up to meet his on the chain of the swing, he interlaced his fingers with hers and held on.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><hr /><h3>October 2005</h3><br /><br />Jack had just settled in front of the tv with a beer and his DVR when the doorbell rang.  It took him by surprise and he stared at the door for a minute, enough time for the doorbell to ring again, before getting up to answer it.<br /><br />&#8220;Hi, General Jack!&#8221;<br /><br />Of course.  Two teenagers, girls who could have been twins &#8211; same height (what there was of it), similar round features, long straight hair somewhere between dark brown and black, and coats only distinguished by color.  Jack recognized them, but the cognitive dissonance of seeing them on his doorstep had his mind going completely blank.  <br /><br />He did have the presence of mind to raise an eyebrow, however.  &#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said a little uncertainly, looking over the shoulders at the little red Honda in front of his house and then back at the girls.  They grinned, a little nervously, but they didn&#8217;t look like they were in trouble and there were no cops on their tails.<br /><br />&#8220;So we were in the area and thought we&#8217;d stop by for a visit,&#8221; said the one in the green coat.  Jack remembered she had a nickname.  Something treelike but not.<br /><br />&#8220;Verne?&#8221; he guessed and was rewarded with a grin.  &#8220;And . . .&#8221; Jack had no clue.<br /><br />&#8220;Ana,&#8221; Ana helped him out.  &#8220;We&#8217;re real sorry to just show up like this.  My mother would die if she found out.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;So,&#8221; Jack didn&#8217;t like the sound of that.   &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t know you&#8217;re here?&#8221;  His hand flipped back and forth to encompass more than just his house.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, our parents know were on a road trip,&#8221; Verne hastened to reassure him.  &#8220;It&#8217;s all good.  Really.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Except . . .&#8221; Ana looked back at Verne, obviously wanting her to take over.<br /><br />&#8220;We were, uh. . .  We&#8217;re kinda short on cash,&#8221; said Verne in a rush.  &#8220;And we really don&#8217;t want to call home.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;So . . .&#8221;<br /><br />Right.  Jack looked from one nervously twitching girl to the other, resisting the urge to sigh.  This was one side affect of being Xander&#8217;s dad that he had not anticipated.  &#8220;Yeah, okay,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Come on in,&#8221; Jack stepped back to let them pass.  Something was up and they might as well do this inside where it was warm.  He took their coats and asked, &#8220;Want something to drink?&#8221;<br /><br />They followed him into the kitchen where he handed out glasses and offered them the tap since the only thing in the fridge was beer.  They hadn&#8217;t eaten yet, so Jack pulled out noodles and dug up some lettuce and tomatoes for salad.  One benefit of being a stay-at-home general was eating fresh food when he got home.  The girls helped and even found some canned peaches in the cupboard.<br /><br />&#8220;So road trip,&#8221; Jack opened as he put on the ground beef.  He decided that prying could wait till they&#8217;d all eaten something.<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Verne.  &#8220;It&#8217;s been great.  It took forever to convince my dad but it has been so worth it.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Where&#8217;ve you been?&#8221;<br /><br />All over the South and Southwest, it turned out.  Verne did most of the talking.  Ana was from Texas and met up with Verne in South Florida when her dad finally gave in and let her have a few months to finish being a kid.  &#8220;I mean, everyone has to go on a road trip sometime before they&#8217;re trapped in the family business for eternity.&#8221;  The family business was a restaurant &#8211; &#8220;Mexican,&#8221; she said with a look of duh, and all right, Jack should have guessed, but he never liked to assume.  &#8220;My dad is so controlling,&#8221; she told him.  &#8220;Everything has to be done his way, and ever since Sunnydale, he doesn&#8217;t want to let me out of his sight.&#8221;<br /><br />From what he&#8217;d heard of what happened in Sunnydale, Jack didn&#8217;t blame him.  He said as much but only got a sad and condescending look in return.<br /><br />&#8220;What am I supposed to do?  Live in a shoebox?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Besides,&#8221; Ana spoke up, &#8220;magic stuff kinda gets drawn to us because we&#8217;re slayers.  We get drawn to magic stuff.  Trying to avoid it is pointless.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You&#8217;re mom had no objections to the trip?&#8221;<br /><br />Ana shrugged.  &#8220;She&#8217;s hoping it will inspire me to go to college.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You&#8217;re not going?&#8221; <br /><br />&#8220;Four more years of school?&#8221;  She arched a sculpted eyebrow at that idea.  &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t pay me.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;College is very different from high school,&#8221; said Jack.  Verne and Ana shrugged in unison. They&#8217;d undoubtedly heard it before, and it didn&#8217;t look like Jack was going to change their minds.  Not with this whole road trip thing going on.<br /><br />The girls set the table and there were a few minutes of quiet while they ate enough to put Teal&#8217;c to shame.  They were heaping on seconds by time Jack sat back with his beer, and waved them on when Ana shifted self-consciously, suddenly aware that she was pigging out.  Jack had hung around enough to know that the girls ate as much as Marines, he just couldn&#8217;t figure out where they put it all.<br /><br />&#8220;So, you run into many vampires on your trip?&#8221; he asked casually.  He caught them both mid-chew, long enough to confirm what they would rather do than go to college or work at home.  Verne shrugged deliberately and didn&#8217;t back down.<br /><br />&#8220;A few,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;There&#8217;s not many out of the major cities.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Plenty of other things though,&#8221; Ana gave him a toothy grin that faltered when she registered his disapproval.  They were eighteen, for crying out loud.  His thoughts flickered back to watching Vi take on a monster with too many legs too count, amazed, horrified.  He got it.  He did, but he would never like it.<br /><br />&#8220;Does Xander know?&#8221; he asked.<br /><br />&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Verne too quickly and it only took the look that made wayward soldiers sweat for her to backtrack to the truth.  &#8220;No.  We&#8217;re not supposed to go out hunting when we aren&#8217;t in Cleveland,&#8221; she added in a rush, &#8220;which makes zero sense because that&#8217;s the most dangerous place in the country because of the hellmouth.<br /><br />Jesus, didn&#8217;t they understand how <i>stupid</i> they were being?  &#8220;It&#8217;s also the only place you have backup,&#8221; he said, eyeing them both and reading their uncertainty.  They were eighteen and they had practically run away from home to go play heroes out in a world that wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to kill them.  No backup, no one to know they hadn&#8217;t come home on time.  How could they do that to Xander?  How could they do that to their parents?<br /><br />&#8220;You&#8217;re calling him and telling him.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We don&#8217;t need a baby-sitter,&#8221; snapped Verne.  &#8220;We&#8217;ve been slayers for years.  We know what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Really,&#8221; said Jack.  &#8220;So when you&#8217;re bleeding out from the neck in some backwater town that <i>no one knows you&#8217;re in</i>, you&#8217;re going to get out alive.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We&#8217;re not gonna bleed out like that,&#8221; said Ana, but quietly, a token protest that she didn&#8217;t believe herself.  When she looked at Verne and Verne looked at her plate, Jack started looking for the bruises he knew would have long since healed.<br /><br />&#8220;What happened?&#8221; he asked.<br /><br />&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; &#8220;It was stupid,&#8221; they both answered at once, stopping on top of their words.  &#8220;Just . . .&#8221; Verne finally looked up.  &#8220;It was close, you know?&#8221;  Jack nodded and waited for her to go on.  <br /><br />&#8220;It was a mud creature, down in New Mexico, and we didn&#8217;t know how to kill it,&#8221; said Ana.  &#8220;A local hunter came with dirt and a flame thrower while we were getting sucked under.  Saved us.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;He tried to convince us it was some sewer back-up or something,&#8221; Verne smiled wryly.  Demon hunters, Xander had told him when he&#8217;d asked why most of the country was monster free, were regular people who fought evil with a little ingenuity and a lot of luck.  Some were no better than the creatures they hunted, and too many saw the world in black and white, according to Xander, but they kept the malevolent demon population more or less under control outside of hotspots.<br /><br />&#8220;Let me guess, you lost your wallets there,&#8221; said Jack.<br /><br />The girls nodded.  &#8220;Phones too.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Our Council ones.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;And Xander&#8217;s going to be pissed.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack looked from one to the other, two pair of beguiling brown eyes pleading with him, and the other reason for this visit became clear.  &#8220;You want me to call him for you.&#8221;  He couldn&#8217;t believe it.  They were more scared of Xander than him.  On the other hand, if he were their CO, he wouldn&#8217;t be very happy with them either.  Hell, he wasn&#8217;t their CO and he was unhappy with what they&#8217;d done.<br /><br />&#8220;Or at least convince him not to kill us,&#8221; said Verne, only half-joking.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know.  Sounds like you deserve it.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Please, Jack?&#8221;<br /><br />Of course he would.  There was no question of that, and they probably knew it which was why they&#8217;d driven all the way from New Mexico to his house.  &#8220;Finish eating,&#8221; he told them.  Taking it for the agreement it was, the girls smiled in relief and got back to their interrupted dinner.  As they finished up a thought occurred to Jack. &#8220;How did you know where I lived anyway?&#8221; he asked.<br /><br />&#8220;You were pretty easy to look up once we got in town,&#8221; Ana answered.<br /><br />&#8220;And you just happened to know my first name?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re kinda the worst kept secret at camp,&#8221; Verne said.<br /><br />&#8220;Aahh!&#8221; Jack cut her off before she said something he really didn&#8217;t want to know.<br /><br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to hear all about how hot Kat thinks you are?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No!&#8221; Jack said emphatically, standing and getting out of there while the two of them snickered behind him.  &#8220;Yeah, yeah, laugh it up,&#8221; he said over his shoulder.  The girls followed soon after and rinsed their plates but thankfully didn&#8217;t push it.  Jack grabbed the phone.  Verne fidgeted when she saw it in his hand, trying to look casual.  Ana just nodded that they were ready.<br /><br />It took two rings for Xander to pick up.  &#8220;Jack!  You&#8217;re calling twice this week.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Hey, Xander.  My day was great.  Thanks for asking,&#8221; said Jack.<br /><br />&#8220;How was your day?  Blah blah blah.  Now what&#8217;s going on?&#8221; said Xander making Jack smile.  His son was too perceptive.<br /><br />&#8220;Nothing bad,&#8221; Jack reassured him.  &#8220;And I promised them you wouldn&#8217;t kill them,&#8221; he said.  Before Xander could splutter through asking what the hell, Jack passed Verne the phone and retreated to the living room where he could be a little more subtle about eavesdropping.  Verne greeted Xander cheerfully to cover up the nerves that were currently twisting the hem of her shirt out of shape.<br /><br />&#8220;. . . Me and Ana were passing through.  You know, road trip after graduation . . .&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220; . . . There might be vampire slaying involved.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack almost wished he had picked up the other line when Verne held her breath and didn&#8217;t let it go for a full thirty seconds.<br /><br />&#8220;. . . We&#8217;re not apologizing,&#8221; she finally said.  &#8220;This is who we are.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;. . . Then it&#8217;s what we want to do.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;. . . Look, nothing&#8217;s happened to us.  We&#8217;re fine.  We&#8217;ll be fine.  We&#8217;re looking after each other and being careful.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;. . . It was no big deal.  It was a little close, but we got out okay.  And we&#8217;re fine.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;. . . Yes!&#8221;  Jack could hear the exasperated eye-roll from the couch.  &#8220;All right, just a sec.&#8221;<br /><br />Verne came in a moment later and held the phone out to Jack.  &#8220;He wants tot talk to you,&#8221; she said before retreating to Ana in the kitchen.<br /><br />&#8220;Xander,&#8221; said Jack.<br /><br />&#8220;Jesus!&#8221; said Xander.  &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe they just took off like that.  You have a fire poker, right?  You can beat them &#8216;round the head for me?&#8221;<br /><br />Jack chuckled, his eyes darting to the poker he did indeed have.  &#8220;They&#8217;re okay,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;They had a close call and it scared them.  Nothing else would have done it.&#8221;<br /><br />Xander sighed, frustrated, &#8220;I know.  Now I just gotta figure out what to do about it.  I can&#8217;t just let them wander around the country like stray puppies looking for the next ball to chase.  They&#8217;ll get themselves killed.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What about all that crap about destiny and attracting trouble no matter what?&#8221; asked Jack because hadn&#8217;t he been saying this all along?<br /><br />&#8220;Goes hand in hand with a Slayer lifetime of less than two years,&#8221; Xander replied.  &#8220;There&#8217;s inevitability and then there&#8217;s practical precautions like having backup.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;So you&#8217;re going to . . .&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Offer them jobs and drag their asses here where I can keep my on them.  Make them live to regret it.  Just when I thought we finally had a male majority.&#8221;  Xander sighed again.<br /><br />&#8220;With the dog you&#8217;ll be even,&#8221; said Jack.  He had a feeling Xander would be happier with a fuller house anyway.  &#8220;They&#8217;re good kids.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah, charming.  Don&#8217;t forget about the fire poker,&#8221; was Xander&#8217;s answer to that.  &#8220;Put Ana on, would you?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Sure.  Good luck.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Thanks but I&#8217;m not the one who&#8217;ll need it.  Hey,&#8221; he said quickly as Jack got himself off the couch.  &#8220;Thanks for helping them out.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You can pay me back by keeping them safe,&#8221; said Jack.  &#8220;Here&#8217;s your girl.&#8221;  He passed off the phone, smiled winsomely at Verne and said, &#8220;Xander wants me to beat you over the head with the fire poker.&#8221;  Verne played it cool but couldn&#8217;t hide the bob of her throat as she swallowed hard.  Jack grinned mirthlessly, glad because the fear of what Xander would do to her when she screwed around would keep her both in line and alive.  Hopefully for a long time.<br /><br /> <br /><hr /><h3>November 2005</h3><br /><br />Xander peered at the napkins covered in his chicken scratch trying to figure out which one had the guy with the gambling problem and if he&#8217;d even written that detail down.  <br /><br />&#8220;Oh, Don Liter,&#8221; said Daniel.  &#8220;He specializes in East Asian Studies.  He&#8217;s a bit of a hippy.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Daniel!&#8221;  Jack clattered behind them in the fridge grabbing beers.  &#8220;Are you giving him everyone who didn&#8217;t join the SGC?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Jack, you&#8217;ve said it yourself, they need all the help they can get.&#8221;  Daniel lifted his eyebrow meaningfully at Jack and the two of them did their significant look thing back and forth until Daniel finally rolled his eyes and grabbed the beer out of Jack&#8217;s hand.  &#8220;You know I&#8217;m right.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack rolled his own eyes, but the wink he gave Xander over Daniel&#8217;s head as he passed gave away that he was just giving his friend a hard time.  &#8220;What?&#8221; asked Daniel at Xander&#8217;s grin.<br /><br />&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Jack go sit down and watch the game,&#8221; said Daniel without turning.<br /><br />&#8220;Have fun kids.&#8221;  Jack went.  A moment later, &#8220;Andrew!  What the hell is this?&#8221; filtered back through the open doorway.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, this is going to be good,&#8221; said Xander, craning his head to see around Daniel into the living room where Jack was staring at the tv in horror while Andrew tried to explain three seasons of Enterprise and the cultural value of not being interrupted in the middle of a Star Trek Marathon.<br /><br />&#8220;Andrew?&#8221;  Jack gave him a pointed look.  &#8220;My house, my tv, my rules.  My game.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, right, bully the sci-fi geek.  I see how it is.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m having this conversation with you.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Jack!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Daniel.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Be nice.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Xander, hit him for me.&#8221;<br /><br />But Xander chuckled and shook his head.  Jack didn&#8217;t really mean it, of course, even though he would have punched Daniel&#8217;s arm if he&#8217;d been in the kitchen instead.  The two of them were a quiet riot, a whole silent language born from years of close friendship.  Couple that with Jack&#8217;s habit of pretending to be stupid just to wind Daniel up and the holiday had been one long, extended floor show.<br /><br />&#8220;You could also try Jing Hwang.  She&#8217;s also at the University of California, San Diego I think, but that was a few years ago.  You should double check.&#8221;  Daniel flipped the page he was looking at, searching for confirmation.  Shaking his head when he didn&#8217;t find it, he handed the sheet to Xander so he could get her phone number and the proper spelling of her name.<br /><br />&#8220;What&#8217;s her specialty?&#8221; asked Xander as he added her to his list.  He had about fifteen names of people Daniel thought would be approachable by the Watcher&#8217;s Council &#8211; i.e. Xander in his best suit looking to get some help before he drove himself crazy with worry over wandering slayers who thought they were ready to go after monsters alone.  Verne and Ana&#8217;s little road trip had scared him as much as their close call had scared them into coming here to Jack&#8217;s house.  After the scaring and the yelling and the promising and about a zillion phone calls to Florida and Texas, things had worked out and nobody was dead.  Verne and Ana were full time slayers on the Hellmouth, and Xander had a pressing need for there to be more Watchers.  As soon as humanly possible.  Superhumanly, would be better.  Xander didn&#8217;t want to think about how many girls were currently lying through their teeth during their monthly check-ins.<br /><br />&#8220;Biological oceanography.&#8221;  Daniel grinned when Xander frowned at him.  &#8220;You did say anybody.&#8221;<br /><br />Xander had.  He was that desperate.  Still, &#8220;Why the hell would the SGC need a biological oceanographist.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oceanographer,&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of planets out there and they deal with aquatic microbes.  You should ask Sam.  It&#8217;s more her end of the science spectrum.&#8221;<br /><br />Honestly, Xander didn&#8217;t really care that much and just noted that Jing Hwang was unlikely to give him the time of day.  What the hell would a biology ocean person want to do with slaying vampires and demons?  He would probably get laughed out of her office.  He would probably get laughed out of all their offices, he thought, looking back over the names of mostly academics.  And if they did listen and accept the job, Xander had no doubt that he was going to have to train the Wesley out of them before they were fit to back anyone up.  &#8220;This is gonna be a disaster,&#8221; he said.  No way was he going to be able to do this by himself.<br /><br />&#8220;What&#8217;s gonna be a disaster?&#8221; asked Jack, wandering back in and over to the leftovers from yesterday&#8217;s feast.<br /><br />&#8220;This.  Okay, even assuming these people listen to me, let alone believe me for long enough to get them to come to Cleveland, I&#8217;ve still got to train them all somehow.  So they don&#8217;t get anyone killed.&#8221;  Xander sighed and decided that food was a good idea right now.  He joined Jack in grabbing more stuffing and roast vegetables and a couple slices of turkey.<br /><br />&#8220;Hey!&#8221;  Jack turned suddenly over his shoulder.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare touch the remote!&#8221; he told Andrew who slunk back into the couch muttering.  &#8220;Why did you bring him again?&#8221; grumbled Jack.<br /><br />&#8220;He&#8217;s family,&#8221; said Xander around the turkey.  &#8220;Sort of.  And the girls wouldn&#8217;t take him to Florida.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack sighed.  &#8220;As long as he leaves the remote alone.&#8221;  Xander understood his frustration.  Andrew wasn&#8217;t easy to handle even when you were used to him, even now when he was much more settled and mellowed than he used to be.<br /><br />&#8220;He&#8217;s making an effort,&#8221; Xander offered.  <br /><br />Jack nodded and picked at his slice of turkey with his fingers.  &#8220;I know.  I&#8217;m not really complaining,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;You want any help with a training program?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;For your Watchers &#8211; and for the record, that&#8217;s a stupid name.  You hardly watch.  At least I hope you don&#8217;t.  Or I wish you did.  Or, you know.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Xander chuckled.  Jack wasn&#8217;t ever going to change.<br /><br />&#8220;So you want help with a training program?  We&#8217;ve pretty much gotten adjusting people to aliens down to a science.  Ask Daniel.  I bet he could write a real good spiel for you.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;How did your helping turn into me helping?&#8221; asked Daniel, looking up at them over his glasses.<br /><br />&#8220;Because me helping is asking you for help.  Besides, you weren&#8217;t going to say no.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t?&#8221;<br /><br />Jack just gestured to the address book and the paper spread out on the table and raised an eyebrow until Daniel hmmed and grimaced and acknowledged the point by going back to checking for any names he may have missed.<br /><br />&#8220;See?&#8221; said Jack, bumping Xander&#8217;s shoulder.  &#8220;It won&#8217;t be so bad.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You say that now.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;And I&#8217;ll still be right once you get things up and running.&#8221;  He grinned in that way he had of discouraging all arguments to the contrary, and even though he had his doubts, Xander believed him anyway.<br /><br /> <br /><hr /><h3>December 2005</h3><br /><br />&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I let you talk me into this,&#8221; said Xander.  Bundled up against the cold, only his eye and ears were visible and no doubt directing hostile thoughts at Jack for putting them in this situation.<br /><br />Jack grinned.  &#8220;Like I could tell you to do anything,&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;Besides, what&#8217;s not to love?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;The snow, the outdoors, the lack of central heat?&#8221; said Xander.<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s not Christmas without snow,&#8221; Jack told him.  He nodded out to the crusty pond and the evergreens sprinkled with white.  The woods wrapped around them as if nothing else existed but them and the trees, a view Jack never tired of and that he was doubly glad he got to share it with his son this year.  It was just the two of them up at the cabin for a few days before Xander had to get back to Cleveland.  He had almost said no &#8211; they&#8217;d had Thanksgiving together and he had no one to cover him on the Hellmouth until Diana unexpectedly said she could handle everything for a few days with a promise to call at the first sign of trouble.  Jack figured he owed her a pretty awesome Christmas present for that, even if Xander kept complaining about the cold.  He cast another fond glance at Xander in his layers of coats and scarf and hat.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you survived in Southern California.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Hey!  It snowed once!&#8221;<br /><br />Jack raised an eyebrow, not believing it because where Xander grew up was practically a desert.  They didn&#8217;t even have seasons, for crying out loud.<br /><br />&#8220;It did,&#8221; Xander insisted.  &#8220;A little bit.  And was probably mystical in origin, but it still counts.&#8221;  The eye shifted and Jack could imagine Xander&#8217;s expression of disgruntled insistence.<br /><br />&#8220;You had mystical snow?&#8221; said Jack.<br /><br />The lumps that were Xander&#8217;s shoulders rose and fell.  &#8220;Yeah.  Hellmouth.  You know how it goes.&#8221; <br /><br />Jack raised an eyebrow at him, but Xander didn&#8217;t elaborate.  Jack debated asking for a moment, wondering if this was one of those things that he didn&#8217;t want to know about or one that Xander didn&#8217;t want to talk about.  Better not to know, he decided, as Xander paused to stare across the pond.<br /><br />&#8220;I was camping that night, too,&#8221; he said, voice soft.<br /><br />&#8220;Out slaying something?&#8221; asked Jack since Xander had brought it up after all.<br /><br />&#8220;No.&#8221;  He was quiet for a long drawn out breath, then two.  The sky darkened as the sun slipped over the tree line, not quite set, but leaving them shrouded in dusk nevertheless.  &#8220;My dad used to drink, you know.  Tony.&#8221;  Xander didn&#8217;t look at him but kept staring at the far shore, still as the frozen water.  &#8220;It started after he got laid off when I was in seventh grade.  He just . . . changed.  He resented my mom cause she was still working, started yelling at her all the time, expected all the house work to be done, didn&#8217;t help her.  It didn&#8217;t stop when he got another job.  Mom just started drinking, too.  It was worst around Christmas, so I would take a sleeping bag to the back yard to get out of the cross fire.&#8221;  <br /><br />When he turned, Xander&#8217;s face was completely in shadow.  The lip of his jacket had slid down, no longer covering his chin and nose.  &#8220;It was kind of a shock when it started snowing on me,&#8221; he smiled, hiding behind the humor.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Jack softly.<br /><br />Xander shrugged again.  &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t you&#8217;re fault.  And it wasn&#8217;t that bad.&#8221;  He started walking again and Jack joined him a half pace behind.  Bad or not, it should never have happened.  No kid should ever feel like the only escape from his parents was to sleep in the backyard on Christmas.  Even if it wasn&#8217;t Jack&#8217;s fault he couldn&#8217;t help but feel responsible for it anyway.<br /><br />&#8220;Still.  I should &#8211;&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Jack,&#8221; Xander interrupted, stopping him with a hand on his arm.  &#8220;Dad.&#8221;  He smiled again and this time it reached his eyes.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t feel sorry for me.  You&#8217;ll screw up the tapestry of my life or something.  I&#8217;ve seen it happen.  It&#8217;s not pretty.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah, okay,&#8221; Jack nodded.  He&#8217;d seen it happen too, and truth be told, things had worked out pretty damn well considering.  Xander had turned into a hell of a man, and Jack couldn&#8217;t have been prouder if he tried, his influence there or not.<br /><br />&#8220;So!  What are you getting me for Christmas?&#8221; Xander said so brightly that Jack rolled his eyes at the unsubtle change of subject.  He couldn&#8217;t help but return Xander&#8217;s smile though.<br /><br />&#8220;Who said I got you anything?&#8221;<br /><br />Xander bumped his arm.  &#8220;You love spoiling me,&#8221; he said.<br /><br />Jack chuckled because it was true even although Xander didn&#8217;t give him much opportunity to do so.<br /><br />&#8220;So?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What?  Christmas isn&#8217;t for another few days.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Not even a hint?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jack.  He was actually a little nervous about this year&#8217;s present, nervous that Xander wouldn&#8217;t accept it<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s not a cat is it?&#8221;  Xander gave him a suddenly wary glance.  &#8220;Because whatever the girls said, they&#8217;re lying.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s not a cat,&#8221; Jack reassured him, thinking instead of the brochure and the appointment he&#8217;d made at the reputedly best optician in Cleveland.  He&#8217;d been thinking about it for a while although he&#8217;d never gotten up the gumption to ask Xander about it.  His eye was a touchy subject both for its obvious lack and for the time it represented.  Jack understood about scars.  He understood living with them everyday no matter how much you wanted to just get over it.  He also understood the need to move forward.<br /><br />He had a backup present for Xander.  He&#8217;d waffled so much on this he&#8217;d gone ahead and bought the subscription to Woodworking Magazine and the gift certificate to lumber yard.  But Xander had just told him to not feel sorry for him because of his crappy childhood.  He understood about moving forward too, had for a long time, Jack suspected.  Here they were, weren&#8217;t they?  The two of them learning how to be a family despite national secrets and a regular need to save the world.<br /><br />&#8220;You finally got me a car!&#8221; Xander guessed again, into the game now and managing to look ten years younger and be just as annoying.<br /><br />&#8220;Nope!&#8221; Jack replied, enjoying Xander&#8217;s unguarded delight of not being responsible for anything but giving his old man a hard time.  Jack loved seeing him like this.  Loved him, this kid of his, grateful at the twists of life that had led him here.  &#8220;Better than a car,&#8221; he said.<br /><br />&#8220;Better than a car?&#8221; Xander repeated.  &#8220;Not much is better than a car.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;This is,&#8221; said Jack confidently.  Xander cocked his head, his teasing grin sliding into a genuine smile.<br /><br />&#8220;This is,&#8221; he nodded slightly toward the pond and the trees, and Jack had to swallow hard against the sudden lump in his throat.  &#8220;Even if it is colder than vampire&#8217;s tits out here.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack couldn&#8217;t help it, he laughed, sudden and loud which made Xander laugh, echoing off the water and tapering off into the trees.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we came up here, Dad,&#8221; said Xander after a minute when their chuckles had subsided.  &#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you came,&#8221; said Jack.  He reached out and brushed back a strand of hair that had twisted into Xander blindside, sliding his hand to rest his son&#8217;s shoulder.  Xander&#8217;s eye held his, intense and looking straight through Jack to where all the things that were raw and grateful peaked out.  <i>I wish I could have been there for you growing up, but I&#8217;m proud of the way you turned out</i>.  It was all he could do to not flinch away, to stand still and hope Xander saw what Jack wanted him to find.  It lasted a split second that felt like a conversation before Xander shifted away and smiled.  Jack gave Xander&#8217;s shoulder a squeeze and let go, the silence between them warm and comfortable as they resumed their walk.<br /><br />&#8220;You&#8217;re still not going to tell me what you got me are you?&#8221; said Xander a few paces later.<br /><br />Jack smiled, feeling absolutely at one with the world and the young man beside him.  &#8220;No,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;You&#8217;re just going to have to wait and see.&#8221;<br /><br /> <br /><hr /><h3>January 2006</h3><br /><br />Xander hovered by the door a good fifteen minutes before Laurie was supposed to come pick him up for the first date he&#8217;d had since Anya died.  To say he was a little nervous was the understatement of the century.  Okay, maybe not the century, but the week at least.<br /><br />Xander hadn&#8217;t seen Lauire in a few months, since before Thanksgiving when they&#8217;d gone to the clinic where she worked after Andrew had landed in a scrap heap at a construction site and cut himself up on shards of wood and nails.  So the other day when he ran into her at the specialty grocery store searching for stuff for Verne&#8217;s birthday, it took Xander a minute to connect catching up sometime over dinner with a date until Laurie was double checking his address and telling him she&#8217;d pick him up at seven.<br /><br />After that Xander panicked.<br /><br />&#8220;I can&#8217;t go on a date!&#8221; he&#8217;d told Willow on the phone later that night.<br /><br />&#8220;Xander, this is a good thing!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No, no it&#8217;s really not.  What if she&#8217;s &#8211;&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Xander!&#8221;  Willow had cut him off before he could start with the worst case scenarios.  &#8220;I distinctly remember checking her out &#8211; not that way! &#8211; after she found out everything last summer.  She&#8217;s not going to try and kill you.  Now stop being afraid, mister.  And go get some!  And I didn&#8217;t just say that and I&#8217;m shutting up now.&#8221;<br /><br />It hadn&#8217;t helped that Willow had then called Diana and given her strict orders to make sure he didn&#8217;t wear something atrocious, which just got all the girls and Andrew involved.  Then Buffy called with Dawn and Vi, hell, even Giles called, although to be fair, he hadn&#8217;t found out about the date until Xander snapped at him upon answering.  All of which led to Xander in possession of too much advice and finally banishing his household to where he couldn&#8217;t hear them talking about him as he paced in front of the door with only Ace for company, tracking him back and forth, back and forth from the sitting room doorway.<br /><br />He was so tense that when Ace finally lifted his head, Xander sighed in relief, ready to be eaten by just about anything just so the waiting would be over.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh wow!&#8221;  Laurie laughed lightly a startled second after Xander opened the door.  The sound made Xander relax another inch or two, and he couldn&#8217;t help but smile in return.  This was Laurie, whom he&#8217;d known for over a year, who&#8217;d patched up his girls and kept her head on straight under fire.<br /><br />&#8220;Never thought you&#8217;d see the rest of my face, huh?&#8221; he said, his fingers twitching to touch the other reason he was so nervous tonight: his new eye.  It had been three days and it still felt weird not wearing the eye patch, open and exposed even though the gaping hole in his head was now occupied by a shiny new glass eye that matched his existing one.  The girls told him it didn&#8217;t track right, his eye muscles had atrophied in the last two and a half years, but the doc told him they would adjust again and soon no one would be able to tell the difference.<br /><br />&#8220;It looks good,&#8221; said Laurie.  &#8220;You look good.&#8221;  She smiled as she gave him a quick once over, that made Xander feel like blushing and preening simultaneously.  &#8220;Shall we?&#8221;<br /><br />Xander nodded and grabbed the door behind him as he followed Laurie to her car.<br /><br />&#8220;So when did this happen?&#8221; asked Laurie, starting the engine and pulling out.<br /><br />&#8220;The eye came in a couple days ago,&#8221; said Xander, settling into the conversation.  &#8220;My first appointment about getting a prosthetic was just after Christmas.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s quite recent, then,&#8221; said Laurie.  &#8220;You lost it before you came to Cleveland, right?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s been about two and a half years,&#8221; said Xander.  Long enough to mourn.  When Jack had given him the brochure and phone numbers and appointment date, Xander had been stunned.  He honestly hadn&#8217;t though about his lost eye as a lost eye in a long time.  His missing eye was a part of him, his worst scar from what felt like a lifetime of fighting.  After Sunnydale, there had been too much going on, too much grief, no money, no time, and Xander couldn&#8217;t fathom trying to fix something that wasn&#8217;t fixable.  It still wasn&#8217;t fixable, but that piece of Xander that had cracked open in the wine cellar and shattered at the high school had healed without him quite noticing it.<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s okay if you say no,&#8221; Jack had told him.  &#8220;But I want you to at least think about it.&#8221;  Somehow his dad had known it was time.<br /><br />&#8220;Well, it looks great,&#8221; Laurie repeated.  <br /><br />Xander grinned, the last of his nervousness fading.  &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;  It felt pretty great, too.<br /><br />Laurie took him out to Antonio&#8217;s, a little Italian place that was in that range between Olive Garden and an upscale local place.  The lingering looks the eye patch got absent as they were seated and the waiter came to take their drink orders.  It was funny how disconcerting it was; Xander was a little amazed that he had gotten used to the looks when he&#8217;d thought he never would.<br /><br />They chatted over breadsticks.  Xander told her about thinking of getting a bigger and more out of the way place for slayer summer camp, and Laurie told him the latest from the clinic.  She was working a new shift, days instead of nights.  &#8220;Cathy is on the night shift now and Brenda is wonderful,&#8221; she hastened to reassure him.  &#8220;They&#8217;re good people, and you can of course call me anytime.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Even if I don&#8217;t have a medical emergency?&#8221; Xander fiddled with his breadstick.<br /><br />Laurie sat back in her chair, a playful smile darting around her lips as she regarded him brightly.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know after coffee,&#8221; she said.<br /><br />The warmth and Laurie&#8217;s sudden laughter after a moment of faux solemnity made Xander smile in return.  He hadn&#8217;t really thought about this in two years either, and it felt good, finally felt okay to flirt and chat with a beautiful woman over pasta and too many tomatoes.<br /><br />&#8220;So two new girls are with you,&#8221; said Laurie as their laughter died down and their meals arrived.  &#8220;You still haven&#8217;t told me how that happened.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Not really new, just relocated.  They showed up at my dad&#8217;s place in Colorado,&#8221; said Xander.  &#8220;They&#8217;d been slaying on their own after they graduated from high school and they ran into some trouble that scared them enough to decide they should probably check in with me.  Took them a little encouragement to actually go through with it.  Jack doubts that they would have if he hadn&#8217;t called them on it.&#8221;  <br /><br />&#8220;So you took them in.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Hired them full time,&#8221; said Xander.<br /><br />&#8220;And you&#8217;re dad was cool with all this?&#8221;<br /><br />Xander shrugged.  &#8220;Yeah.  He doesn&#8217;t like it but he understands the way it has to be.  He knows they&#8217;re better off with me than wandering around on their own.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;How did he take the whole slayer thing?&#8221; asked Laurie, probably thinking of her own induction when, in the middle of calmly patching up a pair of girls that first summer, the thing that had torn into them had crashed through the clinic window and her two patients launched into battle again.  It wasn&#8217;t until Xander had shown up to direct body disposal and board over the window that she&#8217;d lost it.  He thought for sure she would quit or report them, but the next time he showed up with a girl and a cover story, she and Cathy had taken it in stride and quietly asked what had really happened.<br /><br />&#8220;About as well as you&#8217;d expect,&#8221; said Xander.  &#8220;Worse maybe.  He&#8217;s an Air Force general so when he imagines the worst, he imagines the worst, you know?&#8221;  He smiled wanly, thinking back to Christmas the year before and the nightmare that had been.  &#8220;He stuck around though,&#8221; he added quietly.  It still surprised him even knowing what he did about Jack&#8217;s work.  His own parents had always turned a blind eye, even when the world Xander lived in was staring at them in the face as circus folk.  The sheer amount that Jack cared about him was still unfathomable, and Xander would probably spend the rest of his life trying to wrap his head around it.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; said Laurie.  &#8220;It&#8217;s still amazing that he found you.  I can&#8217;t imagine what it would be like to just all of a sudden have a different father.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Lucky.&#8221;  The word escaped before Xander even thought about it, and he chuckled a little self consciously.  &#8220;Or cursed, depending on how you look at it.  At least now I&#8217;m too old to be grounded.&#8221;<br /><br />Laurie grinned.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t imagine that ever stopped you,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I had four parents, counting the steps, and it never did much good when they were trying to keep me in.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh?&#8221;<br /><br />Laurie told him about the curfew wars, the back and forth between two households that didn&#8217;t like each other, and the crap Laurie and her brothers pulled that was straight out of a sitcom.  Xander hadn&#8217;t laughed so hard in his life.  By the time desert and coffee rolled around they&#8217;d moved on to pranks and love spells and all the humorous ways that magic had a way of backfiring.  Xander managed to snag the bill before Laurie could, even though it had been her taking him out.<br /><br />&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to,&#8221; she protested.<br /><br />&#8220;I want to,&#8221; Xander told her.  He caught her eye and the buzz between them was palpable.  The rusty feeling of warmth that washed through Xander felt right, with only the ghost of guilt lingering.<br /><br />Laurie drove him home and dropped him off with a kiss on the cheek and her phone number.  Xander fingered the paper, thinking of everything and nothing in particular, before finally nodding to himself.  In Sunnydale, if anyone had asked him where he thought he&#8217;d be now, this wouldn&#8217;t have been it.  Not on a street in suburban Cleveland with the Spanish Inquisition waiting for him on the other side of the door, a half grown dog that probably needed to go out, and patrol reports that needed to be compiled and set to London.  But here he was, out in the world, doing his part in the fight against darkness, work tempered by teenagers and long lost parents and a date that didn&#8217;t end with a rescue.  It wasn&#8217;t anything he could have, or would have, predicted but it wasn&#8217;t bad.  Despite everything, it wasn&#8217;t bad at all.<br /><br /> <br /><hr /><h3>February 2006</h3><br /><br />&#8220;The third floor&#8217;s a mess.  Pretty much an empty shell but I can work with that.  I&#8216;m thinking of putting the girls up there, with proper rooms instead of the damned cubicles, and they&#8217;ll have sunlight.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Mm hmm,&#8221; Jack murmured, his mind more on finding SG-4&#8217;s report than on the conversation.  He was listening though.  He was also supposed to be working right now which at the moment entailed cleaning and organizing his desk so he didn&#8217;t have to actually read the reports that had backed up on his desk while he&#8217;d been off flying space ships with his mind and putting up with Harry&#8217;s smarmy face.<br /><br />Xander didn&#8217;t seem to mind, continuing as if Jack hadn&#8217;t spoken in his recital of all the attributes of the house he&#8217;d found.  Xander had been muttering since last summer about needing more space away from neighbors for the slayer training camp.  Suburbia was not the place for training armies, and apparently the woman across the street had called the cops one too many times for Xander&#8217;s comfort.  The place he&#8217;d found was a half built mansion on five acres further out of town who&#8217;s owner had run out of money before it was finished.  As Xander went on about support walls and plumbing and adding another two bathrooms, Jack&#8217;s limited knowledge of do-it-yourself home repair was exhausted.<br /><br />SG-4&#8217;s report had somehow landed in Jack&#8217;s bottom drawer where he kept the printer paper and file folders.  Fishing it out, he added it to the to-read-before-their-next-mission pile, then checked his calendar.  SG-18 was the next team that should have had a report in by now.<br /><br />&#8220;Andrew wants to redo the kitchen too, make it industrial and give him enough stoves and sinks to work with.  The kitchen&#8217;s already mostly finished so we&#8217;ll have to tear out most of what&#8217;s there which I&#8217;m not looking forward to because kitchens are horrible to work with.  I still need to find a contractor to do all this stuff.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You bought the house?&#8221;  Jack looked over at the speaker phone in surprise.<br /><br />&#8220;No, I&#8217;m still waiting on the board meeting which won&#8217;t happen till tomorrow night,&#8221; said Xander.  &#8220;We would have already had it; it was supposed to be on Monday, but someone &#8211;&#8221; his voice rose, so he could be heard by Diana no doubt &#8220;&#8211; had a date that couldn&#8217;t be rescheduled.&#8221;  There was arguing in the background that Jack couldn&#8217;t make out over the line, but he smiled anyway.  &#8220;She blames me,&#8221; said Xander, and Jack could hear the eyeroll.  &#8220;Apparently the axe I was sharpening when he came over last week freaked him out.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You were wearing your eye patch too, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That was totally accidental.  Nothing to do with Brad at all,&#8221; said Xander innocently.  &#8220;He&#8217;s just a skittish kid.  None of that stuff even phased Nick or Tim.&#8221;<br /><br />Nick was Verne&#8217;s boyfriend, a kid she&#8217;d met at the clothing store she worked at part time to get discounts.  Jack remembered that conversation.  Verne had picked up the phone when he called and he&#8217;d gotten to listen to her complain about Xander making her and Ana get jobs to keep them busy during the day.  The fringe benefits seemed to have paid off though.<br /><br />&#8220;Tim&#8217;s Ana&#8217;s boyfriend?&#8221; he asked, grinning.  The week after Verne and Nick started dating, he&#8217;d gotten to listen to Ana complain about being the third wheel.<br /><br />&#8220;Andrew&#8217;s,&#8221; said Xander.  Jack glanced over at the phone again, taken aback.  That was a surprise.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah, surprised the hell out of me, too,&#8221; said Xander.  &#8220;I mean, who would want to date Andrew?&#8221;  That wasn&#8217;t the part that surprised Jack so much, but when he thought about it, maybe it shouldn&#8217;t have.<br /><br />&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s something weird looking for an in,&#8221; he said.<br /><br />&#8220;No, Tim checks out.  That&#8217;s SOP,&#8221; Xander replied.  &#8220;He&#8217;s one of Andrew&#8217;s friends from D&D.  I think Andrew asked him to come over and see his medieval weapon collection or something lame like that and Tim took it for what it sounds like.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack did not even want to imagine what that conversation had been like.  Shaking his head, he said, &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;ll be good for him.&#8221;  Andrew, the poor kid, was awkward and geeky and didn&#8217;t make friends easily from all accounts.  It had taken Xander some shoving to get Andrew to join the Dungeons & Dragons group at the comic store in the first place.<br /><br />&#8220;I hope so.  The hormones raging in this house right now . . .&#8221;<br /><br />Jack laughed.  &#8220;You still seeing that nurse?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Laurie?  Yeah.  We had our second date at the movies the other night.  Took us four tries to get a date that wasn&#8217;t interrupted by monsters.&#8221;<br /><br />If Xander had been in the room Jack would have flipped open the report in his hand as if he wasn&#8217;t suddenly tense.  &#8220;Everything okay?&#8221; he asked.  They didn&#8217;t talk about the nuts and bolts of the dangerous aspects of their respective jobs much.  Jack hadn&#8217;t even told Xander he&#8217;d been off-world last week, and Xander had been too busy with some demon or other to notice he&#8217;d called a day late.<br /><br />&#8220;Now it is,&#8221; said Xander.  &#8220;Ana got a little scratched up, nothing her healing couldn&#8217;t handle.  I&#8217;m fine,&#8221; he added after a beat, sensing the question that was on the tip of Jack&#8217;s tongue.<br /><br />&#8220;Good.&#8221;<br /><br />There was a long pause as they both regrouped from the departure from their normal conversational routine.  Jack glanced at the report in his hand &#8211; SG-12&#8217;s on an archeology dig.  Jack put it in the pile of give-to-Daniel-to-summarize.<br /><br />&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; Xander cleared his throat.  &#8220;Ana&#8217;s the only one unattached at the moment and Diana and Verne are doing the happy couple thing where they keep trying to set her up with guys they know.  Ana&#8217;s not taking it too well.&#8221;<br /><br />And this was where Jack was truly out of his depth.  Both his parenting and commanding skills stopped short of teenage girl infighting.  Sometimes he wondered how Xander stood it.  His son somehow managed a delicate balance between big brother and boss that kept the peace, and was quite frankly, amazing.  Jack still wanted to send some teams of his to Cleveland for a crash course in how to handle getting your ass handed to you by unlikely enemies.  He never would, but it sure would be satisfying to see some of the new Marines get taken down a peg or two.<br /><br />Jack&#8217;s second line rang, interrupting Xander&#8217;s description of the New Cold War that was brewing under his roof.  &#8220;Hey kiddo, I got another call coming in.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;All right.  I&#8217;ll let you go back to your General-like things.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Thanks ever so much,&#8221; said Jack, dry as paper.  &#8220;Take care.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You too,&#8221; said Xander.  When he hung up, Jack sighed, he didn&#8217;t want to go back to work today.  Nevertheless, after scrubbing a hand over his head, he switched to line two.<br /><br /> <br /><hr /><h3>March 2006</h3><br /><br />Jack waited a good two minutes after the gate closed behind SG-5 before telling Walter to let him know when SG-14 checked in.  He had two teams overdue and three more he&#8217;d sent out earlier that morning that were still in the green for then next few hours.  Jack didn&#8217;t like it one bit.  While one team missing two consecutive check-ins could be construed as normal enough, two on the same day was edging into security breach territory.  This was the part that Jack hated about being the general in charge, the waiting.  He trusted SGs 5 and 10 to do their jobs &#8211; he&#8217;d been rescued enough by them himself over the years &#8211; but with nothing proactive to do himself, Jack was going to go stir crazy.<br /><br />Carter&#8217;s lab was a mess as usual, gadgets and gizmos everywhere.  The Colonel herself was glued to the computer going through the security files and the access logs.  &#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know as soon as I find anything, sir,&#8221; she said without looking up.<br /><br />&#8220;So no luck?&#8221; he asked.<br /><br />She looked over at him with a twist of her lips that was more grimace than smile.  &#8220;Not yet.  Nothing&#8217;s out of place.  There may not have even been a breach.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Humor me,&#8221; Jack told her.  He couldn&#8217;t shake his gut feeling about this.<br /><br />Carter nodded, simply trusting him.  &#8220;You&#8217;ll need to leave me alone then, sir,&#8221; she said.<br /><br />Jack couldn&#8217;t help the smirk as he left.  General in charge indeed.<br /><br />When he got back to the control room, Walter stopped him.  &#8220;SG-14 checked in, sir.  Thirty minutes until SG-18&#8217;s due.  And you have a Deputy Director Wells on line two from the IWC.  I tried to get rid of him but he insisted.<br /><br />The breath Jack let out at the news that SG-14 was fine for the moment caught again.  What the hell was Andrew doing calling him in the middle of the morning?  &#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of it,&#8221; he told Walter then hurried to his office.<br /><br />&#8220;Andrew?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Jack!  Thank Zeus!  I thought the sergeant was going to ax the call for sure and then I&#8217;d have to try again and probably be cut off at the switchboard and &#8211;&#8221; <br /><br />&#8220;Andrew,&#8221; Jack cut through his nervous chatter.  &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?  Why are you calling?&#8221;  Why wasn&#8217;t Xander? he thought but didn&#8217;t say.<br /><br />&#8220;Okay.  The first thing you should remember is that I&#8217;m the messenger.  Don&#8217;t panic,&#8221; said Andrew, his voice high and desperate, as all the blood drained from Jack&#8217;s face.  &#8220;Xander&#8217;s in the hospital.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;What?!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Don&#8217;t panic!&#8221; Andrew practically shouted.  &#8220;No one&#8217;s allowed to panic.  It&#8217;s a rule.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Andrew, what happened?&#8221;  Jack tried not to read too much into the kid&#8217;s tone that was inviting him to freak out because <i>his child</i> was in the hospital.  &#8220;Is he all right?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yes.  Maybe.  Diana just said he was going to be all right and then locked herself in her room.  She won&#8217;t come out.  She won&#8217;t even talk to me, and the hospital won&#8217;t talk to me, so you have to call them and talk to them, and then tell me. . .&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Jesus,&#8221; Jack breathed, still trying to process it all.  Andrew sounded on the verge of tears, terrified.  &#8220;What happened?&#8221; he asked again.<br /><br />&#8220;It was just patrol,&#8221; said Andrew.  &#8220;But Xander got hurt and Diana won&#8217;t come out of her room.  Verne and Ana threw protocol out the window and left with Verne&#8217;s boyfriend to try and find the Gargoyles and they&#8217;re gonna get hurt and I don&#8217;t know what to do!&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;All right.  Stop.  Back up.&#8221;  Jack ordered, hearing Andrew&#8217;s frustration and worry and shelving his own feelings for later when he could afford them.  Right now Andrew sounded on the verge of hyperventilating and Jack needed him to calm the fuck down.  &#8220;I want you to take a deep breath.  You hear me?&#8221;  He listened as the kid breathed in and out, in and out.  &#8220;Start from the beginning.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;It . . . I think it started Monday.&#8221; Andrew hesitated, the sound of shuffling papers crinkled over the line then he continued in a stronger voice, reading, &#8220;Monday.  Diana and Verne patrol the riverfront and Erie cemetery.  Hellmouth spot check was calm.  Two bodies found in Fairview Park: teenage boys, 15-16 years old.  Skinny and dirty.  Runes on left forearm &#8211; I&#8217;ve identified those,&#8221; he broke off.  &#8220;They&#8217;re Roman death sigils, adapted in the Dark ages when they were used to mark Gargoyles over the entrances to buildings.  The rune would show up on the bodies of trespassers who&#8217;d been ripped to pieces.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t know that Monday night,&#8221; Jack clarified, trying to keep the facts straight, his mind skittering over the news of two dead boys because, Jesus.  &#8220;What happened Monday?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That was it.  Patrol.  Then everyone went to work or school Tuesday.  I started looking up the runes.  Xander got back from his trip to the University of Florida.  I still hadn&#8217;t found what the runes were last night, but everyone went out anyway &#8216;cause we needed to cover the city.  I stayed home to keep looking.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;That&#8217;s when Xander got hurt?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Him and Diana were ambushed.  Diana called from the hospital, Saint Vincent&#8217;s.  She was fine by then, but she went straight to her room and hasn&#8217;t come out since we got home.  She and Verne got into a fight and then Verne and Ana took off to find whatever jumped them and I told them it was a bad idea because they&#8217;re going in blind and it&#8217;s against protocol.  They didn&#8217;t even tell me where they were going, and now Xander&#8217;s going to come back and I won&#8217;t know where they are.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Did you call Giles?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No.  No, not yet,&#8221; said Andrew slowly like it was something he really didn&#8217;t want to do.  &#8220;He&#8217;s busy in Moscow and it&#8217;s hard to get a hold of him,&#8221; he rushed on.  &#8220;And I could be wrong.  It could be nothing.  I&#8217;m probably just worried over nothing.  And I don&#8217;t really have anything to tell him.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack thought about two missed check-ins that could be nothing.  &#8220;Call him as soon as you&#8217;re off the phone with me,&#8221; he said.  If he was wrong, he was wrong.  If he was right . . .   There was a long drawn out pause that Jack figured was Andrew trying to come up with a good reason not to.  &#8220;Andrew.  Call him.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Okay.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Jack.  He took a deep breath of his own before asking, &#8220;Do you know how badly Xander is hurt?&#8221;<br /><br />Another pause for a different reason.  &#8220;His blind side got torn up.  That&#8217;s all Diana said,&#8221; Andrew said softly.  &#8220;Laurie&#8217;s with him.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack rested his forehead in his empty hand.  He did not need this right now.  &#8220;So Xander&#8217;s out, Diana&#8217;s taken herself out, Verne and Ana rushed into things with no intel, and you think it&#8217;s bad.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I tried getting Diana to come out.  She won&#8217;t listen to me,&#8221; said Andrew helplessly.<br /><br />&#8220;How bad is it?  Can Verne and Ana handle it?&#8221; asked Jack, ignoring the kid who wanted nothing more than someone to fix this for him.<br /><br />&#8220;Gargoyles are gate keepers,&#8221; said Andrew.  &#8220;Powerful gate keepers.  The kind you use to protect something pretty important.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;So bad,&#8221; Jack summed up.<br /><br />Andrew hesitated.  &#8220;I could be wrong,&#8221; he repeated softly.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not always the best at digging things up.  For that you want Dawn, not me.  I&#8217;m just the cook.&#8221; <br /><br />&#8220;Xander trusts you,&#8221; said Jack, hating the doubt he was hearing.  For all that Andrew was a dork and annoying, he was someone Jack couldn&#8217;t help but feel for, and not just sorry for but in the same way as when Xander insisted he was family in his own way.  The only way that mattered.  &#8220;That&#8217;s enough for me.  If you say it&#8217;s bad, it&#8217;s probably bad. Call Giles, call Buffy, call Willow.  Call someone.  Don&#8217;t try to do this alone.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;But they&#8217;ll &#8211;&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Andrew!&#8221; Jack interrupted the whining.  &#8220;Call them.  I don&#8217;t care if you think you don&#8217;t have enough information.  They need to know, and they can help you better than I can.  Next,&#8221; he went on before Andrew could get going again.  &#8220;Call Laurie and tell her to call me as soon as she knows anything about Xander.  Have her say she&#8217;s from the IWC and the call will get through.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;IWC.  What do I do about the slayers?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Verne and Ana are out of contact?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;They have their phones but since the fight they won&#8217;t answer from me or the house.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Why not?&#8221;  Just what had gone down in that fight that had their normally functioning friendships split wide open?<br /><br />&#8220;They think they&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Andrew as if it were obvious, and Jack supposed it should have been.  Unlike the military, the Council taught their slayers to think, and now they&#8217;d gone off on their own without Xander there to rein them in.<br /><br />&#8220;You need to get back in touch with them.  Call from a different number, get Laurie to call them, get Buffy to call them.  Keep trying to get into contact and don&#8217;t stop until you do, understand?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;They&#8217;re just going to hang up on me.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Then talk fast.  Just get them to keep you in the loop.  You have to know what&#8217;s going on in order to help them.&#8221;  Jack hoped they listened.  &#8220;Diana&#8217;s supposed to be in charge, right?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah, she&#8217;s Chief Slayer.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Then you have to get her to <i>be</i> Chief Slayer.  If she won&#8217;t listen to you, go over her head.  Buffy, Willow, someone.  She can&#8217;t afford to hide in her room with people in the field.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;But &#8211;&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Tell her if she wants to cry she does it on her own time.  With Xander out of commission that means you&#8217;re Chief Watcher.  It&#8217;s your job to stand up to her and make her listen,&#8221; said Jack in the tone of voice that expected to be obeyed.  &#8220;You can do this Andrew,&#8221; he added more gently.  &#8220;You&#8217;re already channeling Xander enough to call me.  Just pretend you have one eye, a wicked sense of humor, and backbone of steel.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Be Xander.&#8221;  Andrew laughed nervously.<br /><br />&#8220;General?&#8221;  Walter knocked on the door.  &#8220;SG-18 missed their check-in.&#8221;<br /><br />Crap.  &#8220;Andrew, I&#8217;ve got to go.  Go be a Watcher.  And don&#8217;t forget to tell Laurie to call me.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Right.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Good luck.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Bye.  Thanks.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack hung up, twisted up inside.  The last time something like this had happened, he&#8217;d been on the first flight to Cleveland.  He stared at Walter for a second to get his head back on the here and now of three missing SG teams.  Teams that depended on him to get them back safely.  As much as he wanted to be with Xander, he couldn&#8217;t do anything about Cleveland right now.<br /><br />&#8220;Have SGs 5 and 10 reported in yet?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yes, sir.  Nothing yet from either one.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;All right.  Tell SG-13 we&#8217;re briefing in ten minutes.&#8221;<br /><br />Xander, please be okay, he allowed himself while Walter rushed off.  Then Jack pulled himself back together and got back to work.<br /><br /> <br /><hr /><h3>April 2006</h3><br /><br />Xander was half asleep when he answered the door at six thirty in the morning.  He&#8217;d barely been to bed and was already up and on the books when a loud pounding had interrupted the morning quiet.  Ever since he&#8217;d gotten out of the hospital he&#8217;d been playing catch up.  Catch up on the drama he&#8217;d missed, catch up on the research trying to figure out what was going on under Fairview Park where the Gargoyles were guarding the Threshold, which they still hadn&#8217;t identified despite the minions crawling out of the woodwork, gathering supplies and forces.  It was getting ugly out there and their time was running out.<br /><br />Everyone was feeling it.  The tension in the house was worse than the hormones.  Diana didn&#8217;t think she could lead, and worse, Verne didn&#8217;t think she could either.  The Night of the Disastrous Patrols, as Andrew was calling it, had led to Cold War Slayer, where every move was fought and argued where they thought Xander couldn&#8217;t hear them.  Ana was trying to be diplomatic, torn between her best friend and her gut instinct which told her, like Xander&#8217;s gut told him, that Diana was the better choice even when she doubted herself.  <br /><br />Andrew, on the other hand, had blossomed.  Xander wasn&#8217;t sure what had happened that night, but Andrew had held it together for the day Xander had spent getting his left arm and side stitched back together and then kept it together.  He broke up a fight between Diana and Verne, he took over the Council reports and had willingly called Giles last week for consultation.  He&#8217;d suggested a new patrol rule that active slayers have the GPS in their phones unlocked so they could be tracked, and then he&#8217;d stood his ground until the Board approved it.  Xander wondered if it was Tim&#8217;s influence &#8211; the kid was hanging around more, the next generation of Scooby in the making &#8211; or the fact that when Jack called and Andrew answered he didn&#8217;t immediately pass the phone along anymore.<br /><br />Whatever it was, Xander was grateful for it.  The mauling he&#8217;d taken had put him out of the action for a good week, hopped up on pain killers and antibiotics that Andrew religiously made sure he took, and his normal workload was almost too much.  Adding an apocalypse to the mix had taken the rest out of him.<br /><br />Nevertheless, he still had the presence of mind to grab his axe before opening the door.  The wards hadn&#8217;t pinged, but it was close enough to dawn, when the wards were least discerning, that safe was infinitely better than sorry.<br /><br />&#8220;Ace, shut up.&#8221;  He shoved his barking dog aside, getting a hip between him and the door so he wouldn&#8217;t jump on whoever was out there.<br /><br />It was Courtney with a duffle bag.  Xander was sorely tempted to close the door and open it again to see if she&#8217;d disappear.<br /><br />&#8220;What the hell are you doing here?&#8221; he asked.  She was supposed to be safe in Missouri, and last week&#8217;s phone-in had suggested nothing to change that.<br /><br />&#8220;I ran away from my aunt and uncle,&#8221; said Courtney brashly with a smile that was all teeth.  &#8220;Can I come in?&#8221;<br /><br />Xander took in the buttoned up coat and the hat jammed over her ears as he stepped back to let her pass, his bad hand clamping down on her shoulder as she did.  &#8220;Kitchen,&#8221; he ordered.  He needed coffee if he was going to deal with this.  Badly.<br /><br />Courtney huffed and dropped her bag and backpack by the stairs, pausing for a minute to ignore Xander and fuss over the ecstatic Ace, before eventually following.  Yeah, this was going to be fun.<br /><br />In the kitchen, Xander grabbed a mug and the phone, tossing the latter to Courtney before making a beeline for the coffee pot.  &#8220;Call them.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;I left a note,&#8221; she said.<br /><br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t care.  Call them,&#8221; Xander repeated.  Being on the other side of a runaway sucked, and Xander knew Courtney&#8217;s relatives well enough to know that even if they didn&#8217;t like the slayer business, they did love their niece.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not calling them.&#8221;  Courtney tossed the phone on the counter where it landed with a harsh clatter.  She crossed her arms across her chest, pressed her lips together and glared as only a fourteen year-old could.<br /><br />Xander stared her down but she didn&#8217;t budge, didn&#8217;t even blink, every line of her body communicating anger and stubbornness.  &#8220;Fine.&#8221;  Xander broke the stare and rummaged under the bulletin board for the slayer phone list.  He didn&#8217;t need this crap.  He&#8217;d call them himself.  Courtney looked like she was about to protest, but this time Xander&#8217;s glance stopped her, eliciting another huff with the added bonus eyeroll.<br /><br />&#8220;Hey, Dave?&#8221; said Xander when the phone was answered on the first ring.  &#8220;Xander Harris.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh God, Courtney &#8211;&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Xander quickly.  &#8220;Yeah, she&#8217;s here.  She&#8217;s safe.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh thank God!&#8221;  Xander practically felt Dave&#8217;s sigh of relief in his ear.  &#8220;She was just gone.  She left a note, but we didn&#8217;t know where she was . . .&#8221;  He trailed off to breathe long deep breaths.<br /><br />&#8220;You can relax now.  She&#8217;s with us in Cleveland.  Why don&#8217;t I call you back after I talk to her?&#8221; he suggested.  It would give them time to unwind and hopefully get over any knee-jerk reactions.  Give him a chance to see what crawled up Courtney&#8217;s ass to cross three states to Cleveland.<br /><br />&#8220;So was he happy I&#8217;m gone?&#8221; Courtney demanded snottily when he hung up.<br /><br />&#8220;No, actually he was hyperventilating from relief that you were safe,&#8221; said Xander just as dryly.  &#8220;Funny how people do that when their kid runs away.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Whatever.  I&#8217;m not their kid.  And if you don&#8217;t want me here, I&#8217;ll leave.&#8221;  She turned back toward the door, all ready to stomp out.<br /><br />&#8220;Courtney!&#8221;  Xander called out, keeping his own frustration in check, half worried that she <i>would</i> walk out and then he really wouldn&#8217;t see her again.  But she stopped, and for a second when she looked over her shoulder, he saw the scared little girl who had nowhere else to run.  Xander sighed and ran his good hand through his hair.  &#8220;Have you had breakfast?&#8221;<br /><br />She shook her head and turned the rest of the way around, the attitude sliding back into place even though she didn&#8217;t otherwise move.  Xander crossed to the cupboard with the bowls and pushed her toward the cereal cabinet when he handed her one.  It was all the shove she needed.  Xander got his coffee and fed Ace, moving around Courtney easily as she found the milk and poured herself a glass of orange juice.  It was the space they both needed before this conversation.<br /><br />When they finally sat down at the uncovered part of the dining room table, Xander gave Courtney a few minutes to eat.  She had really crappy timing.  He didn&#8217;t need another girl to wrangle right now, not with this apocalypse breathing down their necks, not with Verne and Diana vying for alpha female.<br /><br />&#8220;How&#8217;s school?&#8221; Xander opened the interrogation, as much to start out easy on himself as on her.<br /><br />&#8220;School sucks,&#8221; said Courtney without looking at him.  She&#8217;d taken her hat off, revealing greasy hair tied back in a messy ponytail.  Xander didn&#8217;t even want to know how she got here.<br /><br />&#8220;Are you passing or failing your classes?&#8221;<br /><br />She shrugged, the picture of not caring when she finally looked at him.  Trouble then, either at home or at school that had crossed over until it didn&#8217;t matter where it had started.  &#8220;Were you fighting?&#8221; he asked.<br /><br />&#8220;I got in a fight.&#8221;  Courtney didn&#8217;t flinch on the surface, daring him to get mad about it, which Xander most certainly was going to do.  Just not now.<br /><br />&#8220;Any reason?&#8221;<br /><br />She shrugged again.  &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;It matters,&#8221; countered Xander sharply.  &#8220;And I think you know that.&#8221;  He knew she did, and the way she shifted away under his gaze confirmed it.  &#8220;So I&#8217;ll be reading you the riot act later.  But for now, you want to tell me why you ran away?&#8221;<br /><br />Courtney didn&#8217;t.  She stared at her cereal bowl and concentrated on getting every last bit of milk.<br /><br />&#8220;I can&#8217;t help you if you don&#8217;t talk to me, kiddo,&#8221; said Xander softly, seeing again not the tough slayer she wanted the world to see but the girl who needed someone to listen.<br /><br />&#8220;My aunt and uncle hate me,&#8221; she said finally.  &#8220;I do everything wrong and they keep telling me to shape up, and they don&#8217;t <i>understand</i>.&#8221;  She turned her glare on him.  &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t even matter.  School&#8217;s not gonna help me get anywhere.  Who cares about grades?  Twenty years from now I&#8217;ll either be dead or slaying stuff and all I need to be able to do for that is read up on how to kill things.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;They don&#8217;t hate you,&#8221; said Xander because he really couldn&#8217;t argue with the rest of it on one cup of coffee.  Fatalism was a thought trap that Xander couldn&#8217;t really begrudge her.  She&#8217;d lost everything to the supernatural a year ago.  She had already made the choice that most of the girls didn&#8217;t even face until they finished school since they still had families and lives to go home to after the summer.  Courtney had already looked into the darkness.  Fought it.  And now thrust back into the ignorance of the real world she was a weapon without a target.  Xander knew exactly how she felt.<br /><br />&#8220;Look, you can stay here for a while,&#8221; Xander sighed.  Courtney blinked, surprised maybe that he&#8217;d given in so easily.  After a moment, she smiled, tentative and genuine, the edge bleeding out of her posture.  &#8220;But when I call your uncle back, you&#8217;re talking to him and telling him you&#8217;re sorry.&#8221;<br /><br />Courtney barely hesitated this time before nodding, and Xander felt like he&#8217;d dodged a bullet.  He hadn&#8217;t been sure how deep her stubbornness ran, but now he figured she at least had the excuse that he was making her to cover how she really felt about her folks.  &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; she said.<br /><br />Xander nodded back, wondering what else she had expected him to do.  &#8220;Go pick yourself out a room.  And don&#8217;t wake up anyone else.  They need to sleep.&#8221;<br /><br />Courtney took her bowl to the sink, but instead of going on upstairs she came back to the dining room and threw her arms around Xander.  &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she whispered into his neck.<br /><br />Xander twisted so he could hug her back.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t be,&#8221; he told her, holding tight.  &#8220;You always have a place here.  Always.&#8221;<br /><br /> <br /><hr /><h3>May 2006</h3><br /><br />When Jack told his team that their layover in Cleveland was actually three days instead of three hours he&#8217;d gotten three stares and five quirked eyebrows.<br /><br />&#8220;We are visiting Xander Harris,&#8221; said Teal&#8217;c after a beat.<br /><br />&#8220;Yep.&#8221;  Jack grinned at them.  Daniel was about three seconds from rolling his eyes and going back to his book, but Carter looked less certain.<br /><br />&#8220;Sir, does he know we&#8217;re coming?&#8221; she asked.<br /><br />&#8220;Yep.&#8221;  Although Jack decided against telling her that while Xander knew he was coming, he didn&#8217;t know about the rest of them.  But Xander wouldn&#8217;t care and the house was more than big enough.<br /><br />Carter sighed and gave him a half-hearted smile, clearly not as enthused about the idea as Jack was.<br /><br />&#8220;It will be good to see him again,&#8221; said Teal&#8217;c, nodding his approval with a tiny smile.<br /><br />Jack actually surprised himself with both how much he was looking forward to it and how much he wanted his team to be there, too.  The trip to the cabin had been wonderful, a badly needed vacation from a rough year for all of them.  Nothing but hanging out and getting away from the Mountain for a week.  Jack had even caught a couple fish and fried them up.  It had been a lot like camping off-world back when they were still one team except without the stress, and it had given them all a chance to wind down and decompress.<br /><br />While he had no doubt that Carter was ready to get back to her lab, and Daniel ready to get back to jockeying for a spot in Atlantis, and Teal&#8217;c probably had something he wanted to do too, Jack wasn&#8217;t ready to get back to business as usual.  He wanted to see his son.  Hell, he wanted to see all the kids.  There&#8217;d nearly been an apocalypse for Christ&#8217;s sake, and while Jack had talked to Xander since its aversion &#8211; and Andrew, Verne, and Ana for that matter &#8211; he still needed to see them and make sure they were all right in person.  <br /><br />&#8220;Dad!&#8221; Xander greeted them at the airport, surprising the hell out of Jack by wrapping him into a hug.  Xander was solid, warm, and whole, and like that, Jack felt the worry and tension that had filled the quiet spaces over the last few months bleed away as he hugged him back.  Tangible proof that Xander was safe.  He looked good, his shirt no doubt hiding his most recent scars but he moved easily and his glass eye was even better to see in person.  Xander was grinning when he let go of Jack and said, &#8220;You brought friends!&#8221;  Jack shrugged innocently at Carter&#8217;s pointed look, feeling a little smug because he had the most important people in his life right here. <br /><br />The house, Xander informed them, was a wreck, &#8220;But not literally,&#8221; he hastened to add as he grabbed Jack&#8217;s bag from him.  &#8220;Just the normal six people and a dog under one roof chaos.  The stuff from the Threshold has mostly been cleared away and we can almost eat off the dining room table again.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Threshold?&#8221; asked Daniel.  They stepped out into the warm spring afternoon, the bustle of airport traffic and travelers all around them as they crossed to the parking garage.<br /><br />&#8220;Latest attempt at opening the hellmouth and bringing about the end of the world,&#8221; said Xander, launching into an abbreviated version of Gargoyles and minions and the three demons that had conspired to bring the Threshold of Dem Eil within ritual distance of the Cleveland hellmouth as they drove to the house.  He skipped over his hospital visit and the subsequent meltdown between Diana, Verne, and Ana.  He left out the near misses, the boyfriend that had nearly gotten everyone killed, and the boyfriend that had ended up saving their asses.  He talked about the counter ritual but not about the woman who gave up her life to stop it.  She had been kidnapped to be the final sacrifice to open the hellmouth and was the only one who could stop it by reversing the steps of the original ritual.  Humans couldn&#8217;t pass through the Threshold twice and survive.<br /><br />&#8220;She told me to tell her family that she loved them,&#8221; Xander had said hoarsely into the phone when he&#8217;d told Jack, exhausted but dry-eyed.  It was the first time Jack had experienced the end of the world in weekly installments, piecing it together like a crossword from what each kid had been willing to tell him.  Thankfully he&#8217;d had his own problems to keep him occupied.  Little things like Replicators and stopping a nuclear strike and apparently time travel somewhere in there.<br /><br />The house was indeed a wreck, but it was still standing.  There was even a greeting party that swamped Jack with hugs while in between Xander introduced Ana and Verne to Daniel, Carter and Teal&#8217;c.  Courtney hung back on the stairs at first until Carter smiled her megawatt smile, delighted to see her.  Andrew showed up last out of the kitchen, a tall gangly kid at his side.<br /><br />&#8220;You must be Tim,&#8221; said Jack offering his hand.  Tim wore glasses and earrings and hadn&#8217;t yet filled out to match his height, but he had a strong handshake.  Beside him, Andrew was visibly relieved that Jack liked him, and Jack couldn&#8217;t help but throw him a wink that made both boys blush.<br /><br />But it wasn&#8217;t till after dinner that Jack finally, completely relaxed.  The kitchen was a mess of noise where the girls were cleaning up with Carter making coffee and talking science with Diana, and Daniel speaking in Spanish with Verne and Ana who kept giggling madly.  Andrew and Tim were already playing video games in the den, having cooked, and Courtney had shyly asked Teal&#8217;c if he had ever seen the damage a crossbow could do and then promptly dragged him outside.  After that, Xander had come over and handed Jack his jacket.<br /><br />&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said quietly.  &#8220;I want to show you the house.&#8221;<br /><br />Xander&#8217;s house was still unfinished, all raw boards and plastic sheets dancing in the early evening breeze.  They&#8217;d brought Ace with them and he shot out of the backseat like a rocket to run around the property like a wild thing.  It was a good place, set back from the road with plenty of space on either side within a perimeter of trees that separated them from their neighbors.  The house itself was huge, about three times the size of the current one in suburbia.  Xander took him on the dime tour, pointing out where the offices would go and Andrew&#8217;s kitchen.  A real library once the dividing wall was knocked out, rooms on the third floor for the girls, training space in the basement as well as the yard where they had real distance for the long range weapons.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;ve even have two people coming for Watcher training this summer,&#8221; said Xander when they had meandered onto the back porch.  &#8220;No commitments yet, but two people willing to give me the benefit of the doubt.  It&#8217;s better than nothing.&#8221;<br /><br />Jack turned so he could get a better look at Xander, a small smile playing around the corners of his mouth.<br /><br />&#8220;What?&#8221; Xander smiled back reflexively, and there it was, that look that was pure O&#8217;Neill around the edges.<br /><br />&#8220;You talked two academics into considering vampires are real,&#8221; said Jack shaking his head at the audacity.  He knew how hard that was; he talked people into believing in aliens and they had actual science and the United States Government to back that up.  &#8220;I&#8217;m wondering how much I&#8217;d have to pay Giles to let you to come work for me.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No chance,&#8221; Xander said lightly.  &#8220;But if you want a couple of slayers to join the Marines, you can have Diana and Verne,&#8221; he offered, making Jack laugh at the image that brought to mind.<br /><br />&#8220;I do not envy you them,&#8221; he said.  He&#8217;d had two months of long-distance bitching about the two from just about everybody.<br /><br />&#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re just lucky you missed my awkward post-adolescence years,&#8221; said Xander.  &#8220;Also known as the barely-graduating-high-school-and-then-going-through-a-job-a-week-while-I-lived-in-my-parents&#8217;-basement years.  It wasn&#8217;t pretty.&#8221;  He leaned down to scratch behind Ace&#8217;s ears, the happy dog&#8217;s tongue lolling in a grin that matched his master&#8217;s.  &#8220;Although that was the year that Anya discovered orgasms.&#8221; <br /><br />How he just threw that out there surprised a laugh out of Jack although he really didn&#8217;t need to know the details, or you know, anything about Xander&#8217;s sex life.  Still, &#8220;That must have been a hell of a year,&#8221; he said.<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Xander smiled fondly in remembrance, and Jack wished again that he could have met Anya.  &#8220;Hey, you still seeing that CIA woman type person?&#8221; Xander asked before either of them could dwell.<br /><br />Jack shook his head, looking back over the dark yard.  &#8220;We called it off,&#8221; he said, still unsure of how he felt about breaking up with Kerry and what she&#8217;d said about retiring.  He thought Xander would have liked her.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Jack brushed off the sympathy.  &#8220;It happens, and it was good while it lasted.&#8221;<br /><br />Xander nodded but leaned close enough to bump his shoulder anyway.  Jack couldn&#8217;t help but smile, warmth easing through him.  &#8220;You don&#8217;t need me to give you the you&#8217;re-still-special-somebody-will-love-you-for-who-you-are speech do you?&#8221; asked Xander a second later.<br /><br />The slap upside the head was met with laughter.  &#8220;Smartass.&#8221;  Ace barked in agreement, jumping up, and wagging his tail excitedly, happy that Xander was happy and ready to run around in celebration.  Xander obliged and went to find him a stick to chase.  Jack stood too, stretched his legs, knee popping, and looked back at the half-finished house.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a hell of a thing you&#8217;re doing here,&#8221; he said when Xander wandered over to join him, Ace trailing with the stick in his mouth, ready to go again.<br /><br />Jack watched him look over the house with his hands jammed into his pockets and his one eye no doubt seeing what it would look like when it was finished.  It would be no small feat.  Xander was building his Council from the ground up with practically no resources, nothing but determination and whatever spare time he had in between crises.  <br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Xander breathed, turning to smile at him.  &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty cool, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;  Everything was in that smile: hope, strength, courage, and the simple joy of Jack being there to share it with.<br /><br />&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Jack smiled back, taking in his son, this house, and the future he was forging.  &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty cool.&#8221;<br />"

    Section 30: Briefing<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Jack sighed contentedly as he sank into one of his usual chairs in the briefing room. Tired and freshly clean, the familiarity around him was comforting. Daniel sat across from him with a cup of coffee, Teal'c, tall and straight next to him. Sam's shoulder wound had kept her in the infirmary where John and Aeryn were also waiting at the Doc's request until their blood tests came back from the lab. D'argo had just come out of surgery when the three members of SG-1 had left for the briefing.</p>
    <p>"At ease people," said General Hammond before Jack even had half a chance to rise. Settling himself at the head of the table, the General turned to Jack. "So, an alternate reality," he began the briefing.</p>
    <p>Jack took it from there. "There's this whole thing with wormholes . . ."</p>
    <p>"Jack," said Daniel gently with a smile. The Colonel graciously let the archeologist continue. "According to John Crichton wormhole systems open into every place and time giving us alternate realities. He thinks that the stargate essentially keeps us in one system that shares the same time so we can go to different places in the same reality. I'm sure Sam will go into it in depth in her report, but that's the basic idea. What he and Sam think happened was a breach in our stargate system that let us out into the overall wormhole and then into their reality."</p>
    <p>"And how did you get back if you could have ended up anywhere?"</p>
    <p>"Crichton can navigate wormholes," said Jack. "He wasn't too clear on how he did it."</p>
    <p>"He told Major Carter and me that he navigated by smell," Teal'c spoke up. "I believe he mentioned French toast."</p>
    <p>"French toast?" both Jack and Hammond chorused, wondering just where that had come from.</p>
    <p>"I do not understand what breakfast has to do with wormholes either," said Teal'c archly.</p>
    <p>"And these people," said the General. "What are your impressions of them?"</p>
    <p>"They're good people," said Jack immediately, seconded by Daniel and a nod from Teal'c. He went on to explain briefly about Chiana and how they met D'argo and Rygel. "They trusted us on their ship and to help them rescue John and Aeryn. And then they got us back here. They're very committed to each other and I don't suggest pissing them off."</p>
    <p>"How dangerous are they?" Hammond asked sharply.</p>
    <p>"I believe they'll only be a threat if we provoke them," said Daniel. "And I promised Aeryn we wouldn't let anything happen to them here." Daniel looked at Jack as he said this. The Colonel read the determination and silent defiant demand for back up should anything go down and solemnly nodded.</p>
    <p>"From what little they said, I gathered that they've survived their own share of being hunted, captured, and tortured," Jack added quietly.</p>
    <p>"Understood," said Hammond. "Colonel, if you would offer them the VIP suites for their stay until their companion has recovered. You're on stand down for the next three days once you get your reports in. Dismissed."</p>
    <p>"Thank you, sir," Jack stood as his CO retreated to his office. Without a word, Daniel and Teal'c fell in beside him and they headed back to the infirmary.</p>
    <p>"So, pizza and movies at your house tomorrow night?" suggested Daniel with a sideways glance at Jack. A little surprised that Daniel was the one suggesting the get-together, Jack nodded.</p>
    <p>"Sounds good," he said.</p>
    <p>Daniel smiled. "Good."</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Mr. Crichton?" the doctor's soft voice roused John from a light doze. A quick glance around found Aeryn paused in her conversation with Sam on the next bed, wondering what was going on. "We weren't properly introduced earlier. I'm Doctor Janet Frasier, chief medical officer for the base. I was wondering if I could have a word with you in my office?"</p>
    <p>"About what?" asked John, surprised by the request. She didn't look particularly threatening, but still, what did she want?</p>
    <p>"I'm just curious about some of the test results we got back," Dr. Frasier answered with a reassuring smile. Beside him Aeryn tensed, but Sam remained calm.</p>
    <p>"What's going on?" the downed scientist asked</p>
    <p>Frasier shook her head. "I'm not sure. That's why I'd like to talk to Mr. Crichton." She waited for John to rise and follow her.</p>
    <p>Curious himself now and still a little leery of the situation, John settled into the offered chair while the doctor closed the door.</p>
    <p>"First, I'd like to reassure you that I don't think anything is wrong. Your blood tests all came back fine," said Dr. Frasier. She sat behind her desk and picked up a brain scan from the top of the paper clutter. John just knew what she was going to ask about. "But your CAT scan . . . was interesting. Did you know that you have an anomalous section of brain tissue?"</p>
    <p>John met the intense eyes that were probing his. "Yeah," he said shortly, not wanting to think about that dark time. "What of it?"</p>
    <p>Dr. Frasier looked back at the scan, self-consciously. "Well, it almost looks like a transplant," she began, "and given how deep it is, I'm surprised you don't have serious brain damage." She looked at him again. "Frankly I'm not sure what to make of it."</p>
    <p>"Frankly, it's none of your business."</p>
    <p>"If it makes you a threat to this base, then it is my business," the doctor replied. "If it was the result of a recent wound or torture there could be other trauma. I have experience dealing with neural implants. I can help you if you let me," she added sincerely, and John saw that she really was concerned about the mismatched part of his head.</p>
    <p>"It happened two years ago," John offered. "Done by a professional with this tool thing that isolated what I needed out. He replaced it with a close match from a donor. Except for some memory loss, there was no lasting damage."</p>
    <p>"No lasting damage?" the doc repeated with a skeptical raise of her eyebrows.</p>
    <p>John shrugged again and let her read what she would from it. He really didn't want to talk about chips and Scorpy right now. "Do I look crazy to you?"</p>
    <p>"No," Dr. Frasier sighed. "You don't. Why that section though?"</p>
    <p>"Had to get rid of a little voice in my ear," said John dryly.</p>
    <p>"Voices, huh?" the doctor gave him a sour smile.</p>
    <p>"Voice?!" Harvey echoed indignantly. "Do I look like a voice to you?" In the middle of an idyllic green pasture, Harvey wore a light blue body suit with a golden halo on his chest. White fluffy wings sprouted from his back, extending out in an impressive display. In a ridiculous yellow bodysuit of his own, John glared at him, unimpressed.</p>
    <p>"Alright, Mr. Crichton," the doc drew his mind back to the matter at hand. "I understand you don't want to talk about it." She smiled at him, perhaps not happily, but it was still a smile, and for that John was grateful. "You'll be happy to hear that your friend is recovering nicely. I got the Goa'uld out and patched his tentacle back together. I'm not sure how his blood toxin affected him yet but he should be up and around within a day or so."</p>
    <p>"Thanks, Doctor," John said, getting to his feet as she did. "When can we see him?"</p>
    <p>"Once he wakes up," she said sternly, leading him back into the main room. As they rejoined Sam and Aeryn at the major's bed, the rest of SG-1 came back from their briefing. Aeryn pulled John aside while the others greeted Sam.</p>
    <p>"What was that about?" she asked quietly in Sebacean.</p>
    <p>"She was wondering about my brain surgery," answered John in the same language.</p>
    <p>"Are we going to have a problem?"</p>
    <p>"She was just concerned. Really, Aeryn," he added off his mate's suspicious stare. "I got the impression that she takes her job very seriously. D'argo's going to be fine, by the way."</p>
    <p>Aeryn nodded, glancing around the room as she did so. John followed her eyes taking in the people around the bed nearby, the nurses working in the corner, the guard by the door. "It's not them I don't trust," she said.</p>
    <p>"One thing at a time, baby," John took her hand in his. "One thing at a time."</p>
    <p>**************************************************************************** ********************************************************************</p>
    <p>Quick AN, 12/9/03: Pathways has been updated, but as you can see with no new post. I just got through revising sections 1-30 and reposted them. If you see anymore typos or grammar flubs, or stuff that just doesn't sit well, let me know and I'll fix it. Thanks for sticking with this story. It really means a lot.</p>

  content: "The first time, Bellatrix doesn't even know the girl's name.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bellatrix is striding through the dark lower levels of the Dark Lord\xE2\x80\x99s headquarters when the young woman rounds a corner and stops just short of running into her.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    She\xE2\x80\x99s perhaps seventeen or so, and almost pretty, Bellatrix observes in the first awkward moment. Not in the way that Bellatrix was at that age, before Azkaban clawed its marks into her face, but in the demure manner of a prim, well brought-up pure-blood girl \xE2\x80\x93 black hair confined in a severe bob, delicate cheekbones, a faint flush to her pale face, and dark eyes now lit up with something like awe as she drinks in Bellatrix\xE2\x80\x99s appearance. Bellatrix is mildly surprised that this child shows no obvious distaste for the scars and lines which mar her face, nor any of the revulsion and fear that she so often inspires.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CMy Lady Bellatrix,\xE2\x80\x9D the girl murmurs reverently, and curtsies deeply. The gesture of respect is hauntingly familiar to Bellatrix from all the childhood hours she spent practising it herself, at her parents\xE2\x80\x99 insistence. Foolishness, of course; these days she curtsies to no one, and looks on those who do with scorn. She smiles mockingly at the girl. <i>A pretty little pure-blooded Hufflepuff, no doubt. Little fool</i>...\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The girl straightens again, raising her eyes to gaze at Bellatrix once more. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m honoured to meet you, my lady. I\xE2\x80\x99ve heard of you all my life...\xE2\x80\x9D Her face is still filled with awe and respect. And something else, which Bellatrix takes several moments to identify. It\xE2\x80\x99s deeply buried and no doubt subconscious, but Bellatrix is almost certain it\xE2\x80\x99s desire.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bellatrix feels her smile widen slightly. <i>Well, well</i>. She reaches a decision. Thirteen years in Azkaban have left her inclined to indulge her whims. And almost-pretty little Hufflepuffs should not be wandering around in the depths of the Dark Lord\xE2\x80\x99s headquarters by themselves. Really, it\xE2\x80\x99s her duty to teach the girl a lesson or two. Using a young fool with a bad case of hero-worship is not the kind of thing which will trouble her conscience, although admittedly, little does these days.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So she reaches out and touches the girl\xE2\x80\x99s fine-boned face, watching with detached, cynical satisfaction as the girl\xE2\x80\x99s eyes widen and then fall shut, and smiling as her breathing hitches. Bellatrix allows her hand to slide lower, tracing the delicate line of the girl\xE2\x80\x99s jaw and the arch of her neck, until it reaches her shoulder.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Then she shoves the young woman abruptly to her knees, hard enough to bruise them on the stone floor. The girl\xE2\x80\x99s dark eyes fly open, and Bellatrix smiles at her cruelly. \xE2\x80\x9CA pretty little Hufflepuff who curtsies so deeply should be perfectly comfortable kneeling, surely?\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For a moment, Bellatrix thinks the girl is about to protest, and really, she is hardly in the mood to listen to the pathetic whimpering of a young fool who deserves whatever she gets. So she doesn\xE2\x80\x99t give her a chance to speak, instead reaching out to tangle her fingers in the girl\xE2\x80\x99s black hair and then tugging cruelly, and is rewarded by a faint gasp of pain.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The little Hufflepuff\xE2\x80\x99s eyes are now filled with so many emotions that Bellatrix is unable to read them all; she can see pain and shock, and something which looks like fear, but also the same flickering of almost-suppressed desire she\xE2\x80\x99d seen before.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For a split-second, Bellatrix considers her options. She could use the Imperius curse, but really, with a Hufflepuff, Imperius hardly seems necessary.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So Bellatrix simply pulls the skirts of her robes up and out of the way with her free hand, watching with amusement as the girl\xE2\x80\x99s eyes widen again in dawning realisation. But before the girl can try to fight her way free, Bellatrix yanks on her hair and drags her mouth to where she wants it to be. It is only much, much later that Bellatrix realises the girl did not actually try to resist at all, and in retrospect she thinks that that should have been her first clue.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The girl\xE2\x80\x99s mouth is hesitant and uncertain as it moves against her, and Bellatrix smiles and yanks sharply on black hair to guide her. She relishes the control, the girl\xE2\x80\x99s helpless obedience, feeling the pleasure slowly building in her as the little Hufflepuff moves her mouth in response to Bellatrix\xE2\x80\x99s silent directions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Then suddenly Bellatrix\xE2\x80\x99s breath catches as the girl does something with her tongue that Bellatrix most certainly did <i>not</i> direct her to do. Bellatrix pulls the girl\xE2\x80\x99s hair savagely \xE2\x80\x93 <i>obey me!</i> \xE2\x80\x93 but the girl pays no heed to the unspoken command, her mouth now ruthless and the sensation shockingly unexpected. Bellatrix yanks harder on the girl\xE2\x80\x99s hair and curses, feeling heat suddenly flooding through her. Her precious control is <i>gone</i>, and she is shuddering, coming, before she fully understands what is happening.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bellatrix grabs the girl by the shoulders and shoves her away as the pressure of her mouth becomes unbearable. She doesn\xE2\x80\x99t release her grip immediately, since her legs are suddenly decidedly unsteady, but instead rests her hands there and tries to calm her breathing.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The girl is looking up at her with a demure half-smile on her lips, and the temerity of her composure almost leaves Bellatrix breathless. \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m actually a Slytherin, my Lady Bellatrix. For future reference.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bellatrix stares at her. The girl\xE2\x80\x99s dark eyes are alight with amusement and satisfaction, and she is no longer bothering to mask the desire she had half-hidden before. Her black hair is now a tangled mess and standing up in all directions, and her pale face is damp. As Bellatrix releases her completely, the girl reaches calmly into a pocket and pulls out a handkerchief, dabbing delicately at her face.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CIndeed,\xE2\x80\x9D Bellatrix finally replies non-committally, straightening her robes, wondering who has really been using whom. Without another word, she turns and strides off along the corridor again, leaving the girl still kneeling on the stone floor.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <i>That\xE2\x80\x99s one to keep my eye on</i>."

    Section 2: Follow the Yellow Brick Road<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Uh...hi." O'Neill was not happy, not happy at all. The alien stood about ten feet away from them. He, at least it looked like a he, was a little taller than Jack with long black hair set high on his head. Two eyes, a nose, and a mouth were where they were supposed to be on a pale white face that had brown lines sectioning it into pieces. A vertical bisector ran from his hair line to his throat, while horizontal lines ran over his check and jaw lines. Rather an ugly piece of work to look at.</p>
    <p>The alien garbled out a few words, glaring at the trespassers. His gun never wavered.</p>
    <p>"Daniel?"</p>
    <p>"Your guess is as good as mine, Jack," the linguist replied. The alien spoke to them again, louder this time, gesturing at their own guns.</p>
    <p>"I think he wants us to put down our weapons, sir," said Carter.</p>
    <p>"Yeah, I can see that," Jack told her testily, running through options in his head. The gate out of the courtyard was a good twenty yards away. There was a chance they would make it, but with Daniel carrying the girl Jack didn't want to risk it unless they had to. Which it looked like they would with Mr. Fun-and-Games getting more agitated by the second. On the other hand, he hadn't shot them yet, and from the noise he was making it didn't look like he wanted to. Oh, Jack had no doubt that he would as soon as they tried anything, but for the moment they were okay.</p>
    <p>But as soon as Jack thought that, another alien stepped out of the building. Angrier than the first one.</p>
    <p>"Get ready to run," said Jack quietly, his eyes intent on the second alien as it stormed towards them . . . and cuffed the other one on the back of the head. The alien shouting got even louder as the two yelled at each other, ending in the second one angrily gesturing at SG-1 to leave already. Jack wasn't about to question orders. "Let's go."</p>
    <p>Jack brought up the rear as his team ran for the outside world. Not followed, they heaved a collective breath before turning to the world around them.</p>
    <p>The street beyond was about as bad as O'Neill had guessed from the junkyard. The streets of the slum, while not packed, were definitely not empty. People like the junkyard guys roamed in tattered clothing, jumping out of the way of the occasional car - it worked like a car anyway - that sputtered by. Grimy like the industrial side of any Earth city, the buildings looked like they were barely standing. Garbage and its smell littered the gutters, leaving little to the imagination about where it had come from. Even in the partly overcast daylight, the neighborhood was in shadows.</p>
    <p>No one seemed to take note of the five non-natives, or if they did, they didn't gaze long. Eyes slid off them like oil, too troubled by their own miseries to care about them.</p>
    <p>"Which way now?" asked Daniel as he glanced around to get his bearings.</p>
    <p>"I believe that way," Teal'c pointed across the street and to the right, "leads to the center of the city."</p>
    <p>"Then that's the way we'll go," O'Neill decided. He looked at the girl in Daniel's arms and hoped she would last till they found her some help. She still looked barely alive; the dressings Carter had put over her wounds were soaked in blue blood.</p>
    <p>The alley they followed to the center of the city led to another main street that led to another couple of dark alleys. Jack felt for sure someone was going to jump out and mug them, but no one did. The people on this planet obviously had learned to steer clear of strangers. He watched as Carter approached a woman in a doorway, but she shuffled off throwing suspicious glares over her shoulder before the Major could say anything.</p>
    <p>"I wonder why know one will talk to us," Carter murmured when she rejoined them. Off Jack's look she said, "No really, sir. A lot of these people have weapons. You would think someone would get curious as to why four aliens are walking through their neighborhood carrying a half dead girl."</p>
    <p>Jack shrugged. It was kinda strange when she put it like that, but still . . . "Maybe they just don't want trouble," he suggested. "I for one am glad for the lack of a welcoming committee."</p>
    <p>"I guess." Carter glanced around them, taking in the shabby buildings once more. "I just wonder what's so bad about strangers that we're being avoided like the plague."</p>
    <p>"Let's not borrow trouble," O'Neill replied, really wishing she hadn't brought that up. They had other problems at the moment, like finding a hospital. "How's she doing?" he asked Daniel who had settled the girl on the pavement for a breather.</p>
    <p>"She's still bleeding but it doesn't look as bad. If she were human she would be dead from the blood loss." Daniel looked up with his mouth set in a grim line. He didn't have to say the rest. Jack nodded. He helped Daniel carefully gather the girl back into his arms and they set off again for the center of the city where hopefully they would find some help.</p>
    <p>Almost half an hour and half the city later, the smattering of people in the streets gradually grew, bursting into the throng of an open market. Unlike the darker streets they had left behind, the market was loud and chaotic, thriving with life and spirit. To Jack it looked like the fish market in Chicago, except with more people jostling each other for space and haggling back and forth. And they all were aliens with black hair and lined faces that . . . moved?</p>
    <p>Jack stopped short in surprise as the face of the guy in front of him actually split along the lines like a stage curtain, revealing five more eyes inside his head like a second face. That was just too creepy.</p>
    <p>"Oh wow," said Daniel softly behind him, clearly as impressed as Jack was. And there were more doing it to. An old lady leaned down to inspect something, her face opening right up.</p>
    <p>"A most interesting feature," said Teal'c. Jack could only nod in agreement.</p>
    <p>Since they were standing like rocks in a river, the four of them quickly pulled themselves together and headed into the maelstrom. And this time they weren't ignored. They recieved curious looks, but the vendors were just as quick to shove goods in their faces in an attempt to sell, sell, sell. Every now and then, as they wove through the crowd, Jack saw other offworlders trading at various stalls. There weren't many, but enough to show that they were a regular presence. Nearby, one such alien, a tall guy dressed in red was leaning so far over the table, Jack thought he was going to fall over. The vendor had backed up as far has he could - which wasn't far given the cramped space he was allotted.</p>
    <p>They were just passing behind them when suddenly the offworlder spun around, his long, pale hair making a whipping sound as it cut through the air. Startled eyes met Jack's, then raked over his teammates, stopping on Daniel. Before he could so much as blink, Jack found himself, once again facing the business end of a gun. This just really wasn't their day.</p>

    "Come on, buddy." Crockett manhandled the flamboyantly dressed man towards the waiting squad car.
    
    "You can't do this!" He protested. "We're innocent! Victims of society!"
    
    "Yeah, sure." Tubbs snorted. "I don't think that cruise ship you robbed would agree."
    
    "But, Sonny," he tried pleading, "you were one of us! Remember how fun it was? Come back with me, to the ship!"
    
    "Sorry, pal." Crockett patted him on the shoulder and started walking again.
    
    "Stop!" the lone woman in the group shouted. "You don't know who they are -- they're noblemen!"
    
    "Take it up with the consulate, lady." Crockett told her. He kept going.
    
    His prisoner scowled as he entered the car. "I bet you're not really an orphan, either."

    Section 31: Mission's End<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>The infirmary was quiet when Jack got back from getting John and Aeryn settled. Sam was fast asleep, her face smoothed of any pain from her shoulder wound. They would probably get an extended downtime once Frasier updated the General on her condition and frankly, Jack was looking forward to it. It had been a long week since his team had first 'gated into the alternate universe and they could do with the rest.</p>
    <p>Two beds over, D'argo lay in recovery on his stomach, his neck bandaged in white. Jack just watched him for a moment, his mind finally tired enough to relax. He felt like he hadn't had time to think in all the fighting and escaping. And the blowing up of ships. And just . . . everything else. Did he always feel this tired after missions?</p>
    <p>"Hey." Janet arrived quietly to check on her patients. "I thought I told you to go home."</p>
    <p>Jack smiled and shook his head. "Don't you know this chair had my name on it?"</p>
    <p>"I know. But you should still get some rest tonight."</p>
    <p>"We're on stand down."</p>
    <p>"Which means you should be resting," Janet glared at him until he looked away and shrugged. It was an old game between them. She knew he wasn't going to move no matter what she said but she had to try.</p>
    <p>"How's D'argo doing?" Jack changed the subject. It wasn't subtle, but she would have seen through subtle too.</p>
    <p>As it was, the doctor gave him a lingering look before going along with it.  "As far as I can tell, he's recovering nicely. I still haven't gotten his blood work back yet but it sure made surgery interesting."</p>
    <p>"Aeryn kept hitting his neck to keep it flowing."</p>
    <p>"That's what they said," Janet nodded.</p>
    <p>"Is there any way we can duplicate its effect?" Jack asked tentatively. "I'm not saying we should experiment on him, but if we have his blood . . . it's a poison that we know kills the Goa'uld."</p>
    <p>"We'll know more when the lab gets back," Janet shrugged this time. "I'll talk to him about it when he wakes up tomorrow, though, see what he thinks."</p>
    <p>"He's a good guy," said Jack. "Pretty straight forward." Janet nodded.</p>
    <p>"Go home, Colonel," she turned to him. "Or at least sleep on one of the spare beds."</p>
    <p>Jack smiled back and waved as the doctor left for home herself. With a sigh he fidgeted around in his chair to find a more comfortable spot while sat watch over his downed Major and their new friend. Eventually he would fall asleep on the empty bed between them, but for now he was content to let his mind wander nowhere in particular and wait.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Sam's eyelids felt heavy, heavy enough that all she wanted was to roll over and snuggle into the pillow beneath her head. The dull ache in her shoulder throbbed gently underneath the pull of the painkillers, effectively squashing her previous desire to roll over. Instead, she opened her eyes to the quiet infirmary. The lights were dim and the room hummed from the monitoring equipment. Colonel O'Neill dozed in a chair next to her bed.</p>
    <p>She smiled. Always at vigil, or at the least, close by whenever she or her teammates were down. Though she would never admit it, Sam found it very comforting - and a sign of imminent disaster if he wasn't there. Closing her eyes again, she fell back into a light sleep.</p>
    <p>The creak of the chair woke her again. Sam didn't know how much time had passed, but now the Colonel was watching her. He smiled when her gaze met his.</p>
    <p>"How are you feeling?" he asked in a low voice.</p>
    <p>Sam had the good sense not to try to shrug. "Pretty well, all things considered, sir," she said. "Had worse." He gave her an incredulous look, which was rather comedic and made her smile. "Really, sir. I'm fine."</p>
    <p>"You call a staff blast 'fine'?" He was teasing her.</p>
    <p>"You've said worse."</p>
    <p>"Not by much."</p>
    <p>"That's because you don't *say* anything. You just pretend you're not hurt. Sir."</p>
    <p>"And who is it that spends most of their time in the infirmary?" he replied archly with a pointed look.</p>
    <p>"Daniel," Sam shot right back, tongue firmly in cheek. The Colonel opened his mouth to say something but then shut it, conceding the point with a grin. For Sam, it was like the mission had finally ended. The banter felt good after the last few days and helped relieve the tension wrought from combat and a precarious situation.</p>
    <p>"We're on stand down for a couple of days," O'Neill told her, settling back into his chair with another groan of plastic.</p>
    <p>"How are the . . . others from Moya?" Sam didn't quite know what to call them as a group since they had no official name.</p>
    <p>"D'argo's recovering. John and Aeryn are asleep in the VIP quarters. Daniel wants to have them for dinner tomorrow night. They've taken everything in stride so far," he answered.</p>
    <p>"Once D'argo has recovered, they're going back?"</p>
    <p>"We haven't talked about it yet, but I guess so."</p>
    <p>"Did Janet say how long that would be?"</p>
    <p>O'Neill shook his head. "Why?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"I want to talk to John about wormholes again. There's so much we just touched on when we were figuring out how to get back. This whole new perspective on wormholes is just fascinating - sorry, sir," she stopped herself before his eyes glazed over. But it was fascinating. What she'd learned already had given her ideas for a dozen experiments, especially now that they had their own spaceship they might actually be able to form their own free wormhole, though they probably shouldn't do it near Earth, since John had said something about destroying planets. Maybe -</p>
    <p>"Carter," the Colonel said a little more loudly to get her attention. "You can ask the Doc tomorrow. Go back to sleep."</p>
    <p>All of a sudden, tomorrow couldn't come fast enough. New breakthroughs were always exciting. But the ache in her shoulder settled Sam down somewhat. She knew from experience that pushing herself now would only hinder her recovery, so she closed her eyes and tried to sleep. But the Colonel was snoring long before she was.</p>

    Section 32: Above Ground<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>It was a blustery day above ground with overcast skies and the hint of rain in the air. Contrary to Jack's teasing, Daniel had actually grown up with weather like this in New York, and though it wasn't home like the desert was home, it held good memories for him. It was invigorating he mused, like refreshing water after a parched day in the heat.</p>
    <p>They were in downtown Colorado Springs on a Friday afternoon. Daniel and Teal'c were showing John and Aeryn the sights. They had started that morning with the scenic drive down Cheyenne Mountain which had only been a mild hit, Aeryn apologetically telling them that you've seen one set of impressive mountains, you've seen them all. So now they were in the city poking around shops and boutiques. They had just left a local ceramics place with beautiful tea sets and bowls and other decorative pieces that cost more than they were worth. It was a little gaudy for Daniel's taste, but John and Aeryn seemed to like the bright colors.</p>
    <p>"Rygel would love that place," John commented as they left.</p>
    <p>"Really?" asked Daniel, wondering what the small alien would see there of interest.</p>
    <p>"He can't pass up worthless pretty things," John explained. "He's got to be one of the greediest people I know."</p>
    <p>"Well, he used to be a king, didn't he?" Daniel pointed out. "He's used to having everything at his beck and call. You can't really fault him for his upbringing."</p>
    <p>"Except he was deposed over two hundred cycles ago," said Aeryn with a sideways look up from the scarves she was browsing on a sidewalk rack.</p>
    <p>"Oh," said Daniel, surprised by this new bit of information. He was prevented from replying by a subtle nudge from Teal'c. This conversation was better suited for a more secure location. So Daniel dropped it and continued on.</p>
    <p>They didn't stay long with the scarves, though Daniel did notice Teal'c eyeing a dark green toboggan with white snowflakes and made a note to mention it to Janet's daughter Cassie who always gave Teal'c a hat for Christmas. Next they wandered through a bookstore where Aeryn looked a little lost before John dragged her off to the children's section. Daniel let them go, his own attention caught by The Divinci Code, a mystery that explored the origins of the Christian Church. He wondered briefly what influence the Goa'uld legacy had on the Early Church other than the perseverance of pagan worship. Deciding he really should get a life outside of work, Daniel wandered on. He passed Teal'c in the magazine section with a copy of People on his way to check on John and Aeryn.</p>
    <p>It took a few minutes, but he finally found them on the floor under the Dr. Seuss shelf with easily twenty books scattered around them: ABC's, Green Eggs and Ham, Fox in Socks, The Lorax to name a few on top. They both looked up when he stopped at the end of the aisle, not wanting to intrude.</p>
    <p>"Dr. Seuss?" he asked lightly.</p>
    <p>John grinned. "That's how I learned to read. Which one's your favorite?"</p>
    <p>Daniel shrugged. "Never really read them," he said.</p>
    <p>"You're kidding," said John incredulously. "You never read Dr. Seuss?"</p>
    <p>"I lived in Egypt until I was about eight," Daniel explained. "I probably spoke better Arabic and French than I did English when I was learning to read."</p>
    <p>John just shook his head. "Not even The Cat in the Hat?" Daniel shook his head. "So what did you read?"</p>
    <p>"Egyptian mythologies and other history stuff my parents had around. When I did read, of course," the archeologist smiled. "Mostly I was just underfoot."</p>
    <p>"Well, now's you're chance," said Aeryn with a nod to the piece of floor beside her. "It's almost as good as Sesame Street."</p>
    <p>After politely declining, Daniel went off to browse in the world history section until they left half an hour later. By that time it was getting late enough that they headed back to the car and took off for Jack's neighborhood. Since Jack was picking up food on his way home with Sam, Daniel and Teal'c had been charged with the night's movie selections.</p>
    <p>"So there are a few . . . uh, rules, when it comes to movies," said Daniel as they entered the Blockbuster. Teal'c went on in while Aeryn and John waited. "No military movies, no sciencey movies, and no historical movies pre - 1700. We don't get action movies with lots of cars and stuff blowing up, or family films where someone dies - that includes the dog. No thrillers." Daniel paused, trying to think of what he missed.</p>
    <p>"So what do you watch?" asked John.</p>
    <p>"Comedies," said Daniel. "Happy endings. A surprising amount of sci-fi since Teal'c loves it."</p>
    <p>They started with the new releases and worked their way through the rest of the store. Surprisingly, John didn't seem to mind the restrictions the team had toward movies in an effort to get away from their everyday life on the front lines. He seemed to naturally gravitate toward the more lighthearted movies anyway, the ones that Daniel felt showed why life was worth living and fighting for. In the end it was Teal'c who decided for them by simply handing John a movie and saying, "She must see this."</p>
    <p>John smiled and didn't argue.</p>
    <p>They arrived at Jack's house just as the pizza guy left. Daniel didn't bother to knock on the way in. "Jack?" he called, leading the way inside.</p>
    <p>"He's in the kitchen," said Sam from the couch. Her left arm was bandaged tightly across her chest but otherwise she looked good.</p>
    <p>"How's the arm?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Same. Hey, guys," she greeted the others behind him.</p>
    <p>"What movies did you get?" Jack emerged from the kitchen with beers for all except Sam and Teal'c who got Coke. "John, Aeryn, make yourselves at home," he smiled at his guests. "Danny, the pizza's on the counter."</p>
    <p>While Daniel was in the kitchen retrieving the food and paper plates he heard Jack's indignant "Teal'c!" and a laugh from Sam as they found out what the night's entertainment was to be.</p>
    <p>"It is a classic, O'Neill," said Teal'c calmly as Daniel returned. "And it was you who showed me this movie."</p>
    <p>"But we've seen it a million times," groused Jack. Reluctantly, he put in the movie while everyone else grabbed pizza and settled in. "And if anyone says it - "</p>
    <p>" 'My name is Inigo Montoya," Daniel, Sam, and Teal'c chorused. "You killed my father. Prepare to die.'"</p>
    <p>Jack sighed loudly like a put upon parent while the rest of them just grinned happily as The Princess Bride began.</p>

    Section 3: New Friends<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Reflexively, Jack raised his own weapon a second later and put himself between Daniel and the alien that was shouting at them. The nervous and silent crowd pulled back quickly, leaving them in a bubble of space. One part of Jack's brain carefully took note of it while the other was getting royally pissed off. Just what the hell was going on?!</p>
    <p>"Daniel, you didn't accidentally do anything to him, did you?" Jack asked when the alien finally finished yelling.</p>
    <p>"Uh, no. I don't think so."</p>
    <p>"Sir," said Sam, "I think he just asked us a question."</p>
    <p>"Well that's great. Too bad we don't know what it was," Jack glared at the alien. He was tall, probably a foot taller than Jack, with brownish red hair in thin braids. What Jack had originally thought was pale hair was in fact a set of tentacles, covered in tattoos. The alien's hard expression softened slightly after Jack spoke. Then he said something else.</p>
    <p>"Daniel? Teal'c?" Jack was starting to get nervous with this whole communication problem.</p>
    <p>The alien's eyes narrowed. "What . . . are you?"</p>
    <p>Jack could practically hear Daniel's jaw drop. As it was, only a lifetime of training and combat kept Jack's gun in his hands and fixed on the alien that had just spoken English. Fricken English. The broken stargate hadn't done its language trick so how did this guy speak English?</p>
    <p>Before they could get an answer though, a flying green slug whizzed into their bubble talking a mile a minute to the red giant. Jack sighed in relief as the big guy pointed his weapon into the air. With a shift and a click, he snapped it together and sheathed it in a holster down his back.</p>
    <p>"The authorities are coming," he said turning back to SG-1, again speaking in clear English. "We must go before they get here. I will carry the girl."</p>
    <p>Whoa, that was quick. "I don't think so," said Jack.</p>
    <p>"The authorities here do not take kindly offworlders who cause trouble. We need to get out of here now if we want to avoid getting thrown into a cell. Your companion is tiring, and we need to move quickly," the alien said briskly.</p>
    <p>This was so not good. "Why should we trust you?" Jack asked.</p>
    <p>"We don't have time for this!" the little green slug announced suddenly. Jack glanced at it, not really surprised that it spoke English too. "We are the only ones on this planet who speak your language, and unless you want to spend the rest of your short pathetic life in a zoo, I suggest you come with us, human."</p>
    <p>Jack glanced back Daniel and Carter in surprise. Did he just say human? "We - "</p>
    <p>"It's now or never," the giant snarled as he grabbed O'Neill's arm and pulled him through the crowd that had resumed its normal activity. Jack shook his arm free as the commotion not a hundred feet away grew louder. Craning his neck, he saw ten of the indigenous aliens with some not so nice looking faces approaching. People drew back in obvious fear. That and the growing agitation of the two offworlders made his decision.</p>
    <p>"Alright," said Jack "We'll come with you. But you're not touching the girl."</p>
    <p>A pained expression flitted across the giant's face, but he didn't have time to argue. Instead, he spun on his heel and led them through the market to a nearby side street.</p>
    <p>Once in the relative safety of the shadows, the two aliens slowed their pace but continued walking. Jack just hoped they knew where they were going. The two never let SG-1 fall behind; in fact the giant walked beside Daniel and kept looking at the girl he held in his arms. Jack was starting to get annoyed with this whole situation.</p>
    <p>"So, you got names?" he asked the two aliens not so kindly.</p>
    <p>The giant shot him an annoyed look. "D'argo. This is Rygel."</p>
    <p>"Dominar - " the slug began only to be cut off by the giant in his own language. They continued on in silence, seeming not to care whom SG-1 was. Vaguely insulted, it only added to Jack's annoyance.</p>
    <p>A glance at Carter, told him she was nervous about the situation too, but was taking it in stride. Teal'c nodded at him to say he was on guard, and Daniel's look told him that the archeologist was getting tired but was equally determined to keep going and keep the girl safe. Jack shot a look at the aliens then back at Daniel. His friend nodded with a tight smile.</p>
    <p>"Hey, I think we've gone far enough," said Jack, coming to a stop. The aliens exchanged a look then both looked at the girl. D'argo shook his head.</p>
    <p>"We need to get Chiana to help. Our lodging house isn't far," he told them. Let me carry her. We'll talk once she's safe."</p>
    <p>If Daniel hadn't been on the verge of falling down, Jack would never have allowed it. As it was, he had already followed them this far, and if the looks the giant gave the girl were anything to go by, he had no ill intentions toward her. "Chiana?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"Her name. We're crewmates." The giant stared into Jack's eyes, and the Colonel had a feeling that he was going to carry her no matter what.</p>
    <p>"Alright."</p>
    <p>D'argo immediately gathered the girl into his arms, whispering to her in his own language as he turned and continued down the street.</p>
    <p>"Sir, do you think this is wise?" asked Carter quietly. "It might have been better to wait for the authorities."</p>
    <p>"I don't think he's going to hurt her," said Jack.</p>
    <p>"Still, we're trusting them an awful lot here. I've gotten turned around in all these streets. I don't know if I could get us back to the 'gate."</p>
    <p>"I too am concerned," said Teal'c. "However, these two are the first beings we have encountered that we can understand. And they have not shown us any hostility since the tall one lowered his weapon."</p>
    <p>"He knew we were human," added Daniel.</p>
    <p>"But is that a good thing or a bad thing?" Jack asked, wondering what to make of it.</p>
    <p>"A good thing, you dolt!" the little green slug, Rygel, turned and snapped. Jack and his team started in surprise. Obviously they had good hearing. "Otherwise he," the creature jerked a finger at D'argo, "would have blown you're heads off for touching her. You're lucky to be alive."</p>
    <p>"We're here," D'argo said, ignoring their conversation. They had reached a medium sized building that had definitely seen better days. The neighborhood wasn't as bad as the one his team had arrived in, but Holiday Inn it was not. D'argo and Rygel had a brief conversation as they headed through the lobby cum bar that ended when the flying slug went to talk to the one of the locals at the counter. "This way." D'argo led them to the stairs.</p>
    <p>"Where did your friend go?" asked Daniel as they followed him.</p>
    <p>"To get a healer," came the reply. The giant led them down a hallway to an unlocked room where he put the girl down on the bed. Jack didn't miss the concern on D'argo's face or the anger when he inspected her injuries.</p>
    <p>"She's a friend of yours?" he asked.</p>
    <p>D'argo glanced up at him but didn't answer right away. "Yes," he finally said. "Where did you find her?"</p>
    <p>"In a junkyard," said Jack. "Somewhere . . . " He waved his hand vaguely in the direction of the outside world.</p>
    <p>"Where you landed?"</p>
    <p>Landed? You could say that. Jack looked at his team, wondering how much they should tell this stranger. "Yeah," he said, and left it at that. D'argo nodded, his attention already back on the girl. He was taking off the last of her clothing - carefully since much of it was stuck to her drying blood.</p>
    <p>"Will she be alright?" asked Daniel. He approached the bed slowly, concern written on every line of his face. Sam too inched forward to sit on the room's sole chair near the bed. Jack waited till she glanced at him before nodding and taking up a more comfortable position by the door with Teal'c.</p>
    <p>"I hope so," D'argo answered. "She's strong."</p>
    <p>The whirring sound Jack had come to associate with Rygel approached, followed soon after by the slug himself and one of the locals. SG-1 received a funny look, but the healer didn't comment. Daniel moved out of her way to let her get to her patient, their alien companions assisting her and answering questions.</p>
    <p>While they were busy, all SG-1 could do was wait.</p>

    [Voice: filostrato]
    [003] Chidden have I been so often and by so many of you for the sore burden, which I laid upon you, of discourse harsh and meet for tears, that, as some compensation for such annoy, I deem myself bound to tell you somewhat that may cause you to laugh a little: wherefore my story, which will be of the briefest, shall be of a love, the course whereof, save for sighs and a brief passage of fear mingled with shame, ran smooth to a happy consummation.
    
    [Voice: filostrato]
    [004] Know then, noble ladies, that 'tis no long time since there dwelt in Romagna a right worthy and courteous knight, Messer Lizio da Valbona by name, who was already verging upon old age, when, as it happened, there was born to him of his wife, Madonna Giacomina, [005] a daughter, who, as she grew up, became the fairest and most debonair of all the girls of those parts, and, for that she was the only daughter left to them, was most dearly loved and cherished by her father and mother, who guarded her with most jealous care, thinking to arrange some great match for her. [006] Now there was frequently in Messer Lizio's house, and much in his company, a fine, lusty young man, one Ricciardo de' Manardi da Brettinoro, whom Messer Lizio and his wife would as little have thought of mistrusting as if he had been their own son: who, now and again taking note of the damsel, that she was very fair and graceful, and in bearing and behaviour most commendable, and of marriageable age, fell vehemently in love with her, which love he was very careful to conceal. [007] The damsel detected it, however, and in like manner plunged headlong into love with him, to Ricciardo's no small satisfaction. [008] Again and again he was on the point of speaking to her, but refrained for fear; at length, however, he summoned up his courage, and seizing his opportunity, thus addressed her: "Caterina, I implore thee, suffer me not to die for love of thee."[009] Whereto the damsel forthwith responded: "Nay, God grant that it be not rather that I die for love of thee."[010] Greatly exhilarated and encouraged, Ricciardo made answer: "'Twill never be by default of mine that thou lackest aught that may pleasure thee; but it rests with thee to find the means to save thy life and mine."[011] Then said the damsel: "Thou seest, Ricciardo, how closely watched I am, insomuch that I see not how 'twere possible for thee to come to me; but if thou seest aught that I may do without dishonour, speak the word, and I will do it."[012] Ricciardo was silent a while, pondering many matters: then, of a sudden, he said: "Sweet my Caterina, there is but one way that I can see, to wit, that thou shouldst sleep either on or where thou mightst have access to the terrace by thy father's garden, where, so I but knew that thou wouldst be there at night, I would without fail contrive to meet thee, albeit 'tis very high."[013] "As for my sleeping there," replied Caterina, "I doubt not that it may be managed, if thou art sure that thou canst join me."[014] Ricciardo answered in the affirmative. Whereupon they exchanged a furtive kiss, and parted.
    
    [Voice: filostrato]
    [015] On the morrow, it being now towards the close of May, the damsel began complaining to her mother that by reason of the excessive heat she had not been able to get any sleep during the night. [016] "Daughter," said the lady, "what heat was there? Nay, there was no heat at all."[017] "Had you said, 'to my thinking,' mother," rejoined Caterina, "you would perhaps have said sooth; but you should bethink you how much more heat girls have in them than ladies that are advanced in years."[018] "True, my daughter," returned the lady, "but I cannot order that it shall be hot and cold, as thou perchance wouldst like; we must take the weather as we find it, and as the seasons provide it: perchance to-night it will be cooler, and thou wilt sleep better."[019] "God grant it be so," said Caterina, "but 'tis not wonted for the nights to grow cooler as the summer comes on."[020] "What then," said the lady, "wouldst thou have me do?"[021] "With your leave and my father's," answered Caterina, "I should like to have a little bed made up on the terrace by his room and over his garden, where, hearing the nightingales sing, and being in a much cooler place, I should sleep much better than in your room."[022] Whereupon: "Daughter, be of good cheer," said the mother; "I will speak to thy father, and we will do as he shall decide."[023] So the lady told Messer Lizio what had passed between her and the damsel; but he, being old and perhaps for that reason a little morose, said: "What nightingale is this, to whose chant she would fain sleep? I will see to it that the cicalas shall yet lull her to sleep."[024] Which speech, coming to Caterina's ears, gave her such offence, that for anger, rather than by reason of the heat, she not only slept not herself that night, but suffered not her mother to sleep, keeping up a perpetual complaint of the great heat. [025] Wherefore her mother hied her in the morning to Messer Lizio, and said to him: "Sir, you hold your daughter none too dear; what difference can it make to you that she lie on the terrace? She has tossed about all night long by reason of the heat; and besides, can you wonder that she, girl that she is, loves to hear the nightingale sing? Young folk naturally affect their likes."[026] Whereto Messer Lizio made answer: "Go, make her a bed there to your liking, and set a curtain round it, and let her sleep there, and hear the nightingale sing to her heart's content."[027] Which the damsel no sooner learned, than she had a bed made there with intent to sleep there that same night; wherefore she watched until she saw Ricciardo, whom by a concerted sign she gave to understand what he was to do. [028] Messer Lizio, as soon as he had heard the damsel go to bed, locked a door that led from his room to the terrace, and went to sleep himself. [029] When all was quiet, Ricciardo with the help of a ladder got upon a wall, and standing thereon laid hold of certain toothings of another wall, and not without great exertion and risk, had he fallen, clambered up on to the terrace, where the damsel received him quietly with the heartiest of cheer. Many a kiss they exchanged; and then got them to bed, where well-nigh all night long they had solace and joyance of one another, and made the nightingale sing not a few times. [030] But, brief being the night and great their pleasure, towards dawn, albeit they wist it not, they fell asleep, Caterina's right arm encircling Ricciardo's neck, while with her left hand she held him by that part of his person which your modesty, my ladies, is most averse to name in the company of men. [031] So, peacefully they slept, and were still asleep when day broke and Messer Lizio rose; and calling to mind that his daughter slept on the terrace, softly opened the door, saying to himself: Let me see what sort of night's rest the nightingale has afforded our Caterina? [032] And having entered, he gently raised the curtain that screened the bed, and saw Ricciardo asleep with her and in her embrace as described, both being quite naked and uncovered; [033] and having taken note of Ricciardo, he went away, and hied him to his lady's room, and called her, saying: "Up, up, wife, come and see; for thy daughter has fancied the nightingale to such purpose that she has caught him, and holds him in her hand."[034] "How can this be?" said the lady. "[035] Come quickly, and thou shalt see," replied Messer Lizio. [036] So the lady huddled on her clothes, and silently followed Messer Lizio, and when they were come to the bed, and had raised the curtain, Madonna Giacomina saw plainly enough how her daughter had caught, and did hold the nightingale, whose song she had so longed to hear. [037] Whereat the lady, deeming that Ricciardo had played her a cruel trick, would have cried out and upbraided him; but Messer Lizio said to her: "Wife, as thou valuest my love, say not a word; for in good sooth, seeing that she has caught him, he shall be hers. [038] Ricciardo is a gentleman and wealthy; an alliance with him cannot but be to our advantage: if he would part from me on good terms, he must first marry her, so that the nightingale shall prove to have been put in his own cage and not in that of another."[039] Whereby the lady was reassured, seeing that her husband took the affair so quietly, and that her daughter had had a good night, and was rested, and had caught the nightingale. So she kept silence; [040] nor had they long to wait before Ricciardo awoke; and, seeing that 'twas broad day, deemed that 'twas as much as his life was worth, and aroused Caterina, saying: "Alas! my soul, what shall we do, now that day has come and surprised me here?"[041] Which question Messer Lizio answered by coming forward, and saying: "We shall do well."[042] At sight of him Ricciardo felt as if his heart were torn out of his body, and sate up in the bed, and said: "My lord, I cry you mercy for God's sake. I wot that my disloyalty and delinquency have merited death; wherefore deal with me even as it may seem best to you: however, I pray you, if so it may be, to spare my life, that I die not."[043] "Ricciardo," replied Messer Lizio, "the love I bore thee, and the faith I reposed in thee, merited a better return; but still, as so it is, and youth has seduced thee into such a transgression, redeem thy life, and preserve my honour, by making Caterina thy lawful spouse, that thine, as she has been for this past night, she may remain for the rest of her life. In this way thou mayst secure my peace and thy safety; otherwise commend thy soul to God."[044] Pending this colloquy, Caterina let go the nightingale, and having covered herself, began with many a tear to implore her father to forgive Ricciardo, and Ricciardo to do as Messer Lizio required, that thereby they might securely count upon a long continuance of such nights of delight. [045] But there needed not much supplication; for, what with remorse for the wrong done, and the wish to make amends, and the fear of death, and the desire to escape it, and above all ardent love, and the craving to possess the beloved one, Ricciardo lost no time in making frank avowal of his readiness to do as Messer Lizio would have him. [046] Wherefore Messer Lizio, having borrowed a ring from Madonna Giacomina, Ricciardo did there and then in their presence wed Caterina. [047] Which done, Messer Lizio and the lady took their leave, saying: "Now rest ye a while; for so perchance 'twere better for you than if ye rose."[048] And so they left the young folks, who forthwith embraced, and not having travelled more than six miles during the night, went two miles further before they rose, and so concluded their first day. [049] When they were risen, Ricciardo and Messer Lizio discussed the matter with more formality; and some days afterwards Ricciardo, as was meet, married the damsel anew in presence of their friends and kinsfolk, and brought her home with great pomp, and celebrated his nuptials with due dignity and splendour. And so for many a year thereafter he lived with her in peace and happiness, and snared the nightingales day and night to his heart's content.

    The bartender smiled as she passed across his drink. "There you go, sugar."
    
    Dean nodded and took his glass over to the table in the corner next to the window. He scanned the bar under guise of taking a long swallow, satisfying himself that no one but the bartender was paying him any real attention. He was pretty sure she wasn't a potential threat, though he'd been wrong before.
    
    He kept a small part of his attention on the door - a lesson learned the hard way three weeks earlier, and the new scar on the back of his neck burned a reminder - but angled his head so that he could look out of the window.
    
    The bar across the street seemed very brightly lit against the darkness outside. It looked classier than the one Dean was in: bigger, airier, more modern music. Bigger windows. It made spying on his brother much easier.
    
    Sam was hanging out on the edge of a larger crowd of other college students. They were laughing and talking, clearly enjoying their Friday night. Sam wasn't laughing, but he was smiling.
    
    Dean took a long drink and glanced around his own bar again before returning his attention to Sam. His brother looked like he was doing okay: if not necessarily happy, then at least content. Looked like he was settling in just fine. Looked like he hadn't given his family a second thought.
    
    Dean downed the rest of his drink and stared at his glass. Having a second sounded downright tempting, but it would blunt his reflexes. It was too risky when he didn't have anyone to watch his back. Then again, he was rapidly reaching the point of not giving a damn.
    
    A quiet <em>beep</em> from his cell phone caught him off-guard, and he snapped his head up to look at his brother again, half-expecting Sam to be looking straight at him, phone in hand, having spotted him at last. But Sam was evidently still oblivious to his presence, grinning at some guy who appeared to be telling him a joke.
    
    Dean flipped open his cell and stared.
    
    <em>1 new message. From Dad.</em>
    
    He clicked the button to read the message, and found himself staring at a set of coordinates.
    
    Dean told himself that what he was feeling was relief. His father was working a pretty long-term undercover job, and Dean hadn't heard anything from him in over a month. The fact that his father felt secure enough now to send a text message had to be a good sign. Maybe the cult was getting less suspicious of him. Maybe he'd be able to get in touch more often now. Maybe he'd come back soon.
    
    Maybe he just hadn't been able to risk anything longer than coordinates. <em>Hey son, hope you're still in one piece</em>, that kind of thing was probably just too risky right now.
    
    Dean slid his cell phone back into his pocket, then stared longingly at his empty glass. He sighed and glanced back out of the window one last time. Sam was now chatting animatedly with a couple of other students, gesturing with one hand as he explained something. Dean swallowed and stood up.
    
    Sam was fine. Dean wasn't needed here.
    
    And he had a job to do.
    
    <hr>
    
    Figuring out where the coordinates pointed to didn't take long, but it was far enough away and the hour was late enough that Dean decided against setting off that night. Instead he plugged his laptop into the phone outlet and searched for local websites about Coeur d'Alene. He got lucky - one of the local newspapers had a website, and Dean scoured it, looking for whatever had attracted his father's attention.
    
    It didn't take him too long. Several people had gone missing in recent months, it seemed, vanished in the woods. The details online were pretty sketchy, though.
    
    "Probably worried about scaring off the tourists," Dean muttered under his breath, and powered down the laptop. The rest could wait until he got there.
    
    For now, he tossed the laptop onto the spare bed - <em>Sam's bed</em>, his traitorous brain persisted in calling it - and checked that his knife, gun and salt were all within easy reach before he climbed into his own bed. He settled down and thought about the distance he had to cover. Sixteen, seventeen hours, easy. The sensible option would probably be to split it across two days.
    
    But for his father to have contacted him... it had to be urgent. And even if it wasn't... well, it wasn't exactly like Dean had any reason to hang around here.
    
    He closed his eyes and waited for sleep to take him.
    
    <hr>
    
    It was late evening and Dean was exhausted by the time he arrived in Coeur d'Alene. He found a motel room first thing, and didn't bother going any further than the vending machine for something to eat. By the time he settled down in a nearby diner the next morning, armed with copies of the local newspapers and a stack of pancakes brought by a waitress with a tired but genuine smile, he was feeling much better.
    
    The newspapers here had far more information than he'd been able to find online. There was a front-page article about the most recent disappearances; it seemed four people from the surrounding area had vanished in the last month alone. The more in-depth feature a few pages further in had several other details Dean found interesting. Another three people had been found dead during the past month in the woods near Fernan Lake. There was no obvious connection, apparently, except the lack of any clear cause of death in each of the three cases. The medical examiner had ruled them to be heart failure.
    
    "Refill?" the waitress offered, appearing at his booth again.
    
    "That'd be great... Peggy," Dean said, reading her name-tag and shooting her a grin. "Say, don't suppose you could join me for a few minutes, tell me a bit about this place? I just got into town."
    
    Peggy cast an uncertain glance at the counter, but weakened under his smile and slipped into the booth opposite him. "Well, we're not too busy yet, I guess I could take a break for a few minutes. You here on vacation?"
    
    "Something like that," Dean said, wrapping his hands around his coffee cup. "Thought I might do some hiking out in the woods near one of the lakes. I, uh - trees, you know, they're awesome."
    
    "Hiking isn't so much my thing, I'll be honest with you," Peggy said. "But there sure are some beautiful lakes near here. Lake Coeur d'Alene, of course, and Fernan Lake. Then there's Hayden Lake, up to the north - plenty more up that way."
    
    "I was thinking of heading out to Fernan Lake, actually," Dean said. "But then I read this article in the paper, and it sounds like it might be kind of a dangerous area to go hiking. People dying, people going missing..."
    
    "Oh lord, yes," Peggy said. "It's so strange. I mean, well, accidents do happen, and sometimes tourists can get lost in the woods and run into problems, but these were local folks, lived here for years. And - oh, I don't know."
    
    "What?" Dean prompted.
    
    "Well, they're saying the people who died all had heart attacks," Peggy said. "But one of them was a college student - she was only twenty-one. And with three deaths in a month... people talk. There've been rumors about those woods for years." She flushed and looked down at the table. "Silly local superstitions, you might say."
    
    "I don't know about that," Dean said, trying to keep his interest subtle. "Seems to me there's always some reason for local superstitions. What are the rumors about?"
    
    "People say they see lights out there, sometimes," Peggy admitted. "They say there're places in the woods where compasses don't work properly, just lead you off in the wrong direction or spin round and round. Every so often someone'll come out of the woods and not remember a thing that happened since they went in."
    
    "Wow," Dean said. "Anything like that ever happen to you?"
    
    "Like I say, hiking isn't my thing," Peggy said with a smile. "I stay out of the woods." Her smile faded slightly. "But my brother-in-law, he went hiking out there once, not long after he moved here. He was gone a whole weekend, my sister was near out of her mind with worry. When he came back... he couldn't remember a thing. Doctors said he must have hit his head: they called it amnesia, said that was why he was so confused, but there wasn't a mark on him. He won't set foot in those woods these days."
    
    "It really does sound like a dangerous place to go hiking," Dean said slowly.
    
    "People dying is new," Peggy said. "We never had that before - oh, a couple of deaths, maybe, years and years back, but nothing like this. People getting lost, getting confused, sure, but not dying. It never seemed all that serious until now." She lowered her voice, leaning forward. "There's some that say the government's up to something out there - experiments or something - and that's what's causing it all." She straightened again, glancing over at the counter, where a customer was now waiting to be served. "At any rate, you might be better off sticking to the woods near one of the other lakes. And now I'd better be getting back to work." She slid back out of the booth.
    
    "Thanks, Peggy, I appreciate your help," Dean said warmly.
    
    He sipped his coffee and read through the articles again, more slowly this time. Lights in the woods sounded like will-o'-the-wisps, maybe; that might also explain the confusion Peggy had referred to. But something about that theory just didn't sit right. 
    
    He left Peggy a large tip and headed out to find the local library.
    
    <hr>
    
    The library turned out to be well-stocked with newspaper archives and Dean spent the morning ploughing through them. He didn't much enjoy this part of the job without Sam or Dad. They both <em>liked</em> research, could happily spend hours on it. Having to do it all himself - he was capable enough, but hell, Dean considered himself a man of action. And short of luring the cute reference librarian into a dark corner of the stacks, Dean didn't think he was going to find much action here.
    
    Dull or not, by the time lunchtime rolled around, Dean was feeling fairly satisfied with the information he'd found. He'd learned that, in addition to the college student, the other two people to die in the woods recently had been a thirty-year-old jogger and a local businessman. There was no obvious connection between them, except for the way they'd died. He'd also been interested to learn that the college student's boyfriend was one of the missing people. They'd been out in the woods together.
    
    His research had also confirmed most of what Peggy had told him. There were several articles dealing with the strange rumors about the woods near Fernan Lake - strange flashes of light, compasses not working properly. He'd dismissed the government conspiracy theory immediately: people tended to find it easier to believe in that kind of thing than in the supernatural - too much time spent watching The X-Files, maybe. But the more he'd read, the more he'd come to the conclusion that whatever was going on didn't sound like will-o'-the-wisps. The descriptions given by people in interviews weren't like those he'd seen on other jobs.
    
    He'd even managed to track down the deaths from 'years and years back' that Peggy had referred to in passing. A few people had died in the woods over the years, but in most cases there had been a clear cause of death. Back in 1979, though, there had been five mysterious deaths - two of them, like the current cases, with no obvious cause of death. The other three bodies had been badly mutilated, with fevered speculation in the local newspaper about whether a dangerous animal was on the prowl in the woods, or whether there might be a more human predator out there. No explanation had ever been found, but after that spate of deaths, the woods had been quiet again.
    
    Until now.
    
    Dean shot one last appreciative grin at the reference librarian and gathered up his research.
    
    If his dad had been there, he'd have insisted on tracking down the families of some of the victims and trying to get more information from them. If Sam had been there, he'd have insisted they needed more of an idea about what they were dealing with before they went plunging into anything.
    
    But Dean was alone. And as far as he was concerned, it was time to go to the source.
    
    <hr>
    
    He left the car parked off the side of the road, far enough out of town that no one was likely to come across it. He double-checked his pockets - cell phone, compass, map, gun, salt, holy water, drinking water, M&amp;Ms... all the essentials - and set off into the woods.
    
    He'd researched the exact locations where the bodies had been found and now he headed in that direction, keeping a sharp eye on his compass as well as the woods around him.
    
    What he'd told Peggy about liking trees had been bullshit, of course. Dean preferred towns, for the simple reason that they tended to offer more in the way of coffee and alcohol and cute reference librarians with dark hair and bright eyes. But there <em>were </em>things he liked about being outside of civilization, like the way the fake veneer of normality fell away. People spent their lives turning on the lights to keep from being afraid of the dark, and Dean always took a savage sort of satisfaction in the way that all disappeared out in the woods. It might not be safe, but at least it was honest, and Dean would take facing up to the reality of the way the world was ahead of running off to college and pretending to be normal any day.
    
    "Not naming any names, of course, <em>Sam</em>," he muttered under his breath, taking an obscure comfort in the childishness of it, as if Sam were there to bitch at him for being a jerk.
    
    It was only mid-afternoon and the woods weren't as dark as he'd expected, sunlight filtering down among the leaves and tinting the world green. Dean hummed Blue Oyster Cult songs as he walked along, trying not to wish that Sam or his dad were there to talk to. Trees were goddamn boring.
    
    He'd been walking for just over an hour when the compass needle suddenly spun through three hundred and sixty degrees. Dean stopped and stared at it, then looked around warily. Trees and more trees: there didn't appear to be anything out of the ordinary about this spot. He eyed the compass again. The needle had stopped spinning now, but it was pointing in a completely different direction than it had before.
    
    "Well, shit," Dean muttered, and stowed the compass back in his pocket, figuring it was more likely to be a hindrance than help in finding his way at this stage. It was just as well he'd found out about that phenomenon before heading out. He imagined someone not watching their compass so intently and being led in completely the wrong direction. The number of people who'd gotten lost out in these woods no longer seemed so surprising.
    
    The weird deaths, though, and the lights. It didn't explain that. Or why the compass was acting screwy in the first place.
    
    Dean continued in the direction it had been pointing before it began spinning. He wasn't planning on going too far, not when he couldn't count on finding his way back, and especially not when it was likely to start getting dark soon, but he wasn't ready to give up quite yet.
    
    Ten minutes later, he stopped again and stared around. He figured it would probably be a bad idea to keep going at this point: there was still no sign of anything weird, apart from the compass, and he thought he'd be better off coming back out again the next morning - this time maybe with a ball of twine, like some kid going into a labyrinth, so he could find his way back.
    
    He was turning to head back, orienting himself carefully, when he saw the lights.
    
    They were over to his left, only partially visible through the trees: brilliant flashes of red and blue and a sickly shade of green. Dean stared at them. Okay, definitely not will-o'-the-wisps. The way these lights <em>moved</em>... He chewed on his lip, thinking. On the one hand, he really wanted to get a closer look at them and try to figure out what they were. On the other hand, there was a damn good chance that something was trying to lure him off course and get him hopelessly lost.
    
    Then someone started screaming.
    
    Dean swore and started running in the direction of the lights, gun in hand. The screaming didn't stop. It might be a trap, but Dean couldn't take the risk, not if someone really might be enduring that much pain.
    
    It had cut out by the time he drew closer, close enough to see the dark figures who were shooting the jets of light at each other. For a moment, Dean wondered if they were shades of some kind, before one of them turned and he got a clearer view.
    
    They were human.
    
    Dean dropped to the ground, staying behind cover as best he could while trying to get a good enough view to figure out what was going on. He peered from behind a bush, parting the leaves to see better.
    
    They were definitely human, dressed in weird black robes and wearing creepy-ass masks that hid their faces. The robes reminded Dean horribly of the necromancer he'd run into three weeks earlier, but he forced himself to stay calm and recognize the differences. Necromancers didn't go in for masks like that, and they weren't exactly the kind to work together, either.
    
    Because now that he was closer, it was clear that these figures weren't attacking each other - they were working together to attack something or someone else out of Dean's view. The jets of light were coming from something in their hands, like short st-
    
    Like... <em>wands</em>.
    
    <em>Oh, you gotta be kidding me. What the hell?</em>
    
    Dean kept low against the ground but crept forward, trying to get a better look at what was going on and what the jets of light coming from the 'wands' - he had to be wrong, he couldn't even <em>think </em>the word with a straight face - were being aimed at. It was hard to stay out of sight with the masked figures moving around, but he didn't want to go charging in without a better idea of what they were doing. Especially considering the screaming he'd heard before. Then again, the screaming was the reason he had to see what was happening.
    
    His breath caught as he finally spotted the target: there were two girls on the other side of the clearing, his age or slightly younger, also wearing dark robes but unmasked. One was lying sprawled on the forest floor, unconscious or dead, her red hair stained darker with the blood that was slipping across her face. The other was crouching over her, wild blonde hair hiding her face as she fumbled with something around the other girl's neck.
    
    One of the masked figures yelled something that sounded like Latin, and a jet of purple light shot from its wand and hit the blonde girl. She cried out as it knocked her backwards, away from her friend, and Dean could see blood dripping from a deep cut in one of her arms.
    
    That was enough for Dean. He had a pretty good idea now who was responsible for the deaths and disappearances in these woods, and he wasn't about to stand back and let them kill another two people.
    
    He brought his gun up, but before he could shoot, one of the dark figures yelled something that sounded freakily like 'Abracadabra' and sent sickly green light shooting towards the unmoving red-haired girl.
    
    The blonde had ripped something from around her own neck, however - a chain or a necklace, maybe, from the glimpse Dean got - and she threw it at her friend, a moment faster. Her aim was good: it landed on the other girl's chest.
    
    And the red-head vanished, the green light smashing into the ground where she'd been lying instead.
    
    <em>Holy fuck</em>.
    
    The blonde had managed to get to her knees now, and Dean saw that she was holding a wand of her own in her uninjured hand. He hesitated. If she was one of them too, should he really intervene?
    
    She made a swift, complicated gesture with her wand, her lips shaping something Dean couldn't hear, and silver light flooded from her wand, engulfing one of the masked figures, who shrieked and vanished. The three remaining figures snarled and raised their own wands, and Dean saw the girl take a deep breath, lifting her head with a dignified calm that surprised him. Her eyes seemed very large in her pale face.
    
    <em>She's a witch or something</em>, Dean told himself.<em> For all you know, she's as bad as the rest of them. For all you know, she deserves it. Stay out of it.</em>
    
    That calm expression, though...
    
    <em>Fuck this</em>.
    
    His first shot took one of the masked figures through the shoulder, knocking them to the ground, and he caught sight of the girl rolling clear of another flash of green light and then pushing herself up, staring in his direction. He didn't let himself get distracted, however - he shot the second masked figure in the arm. It was fucking annoying that they were human, because shots like that were stupid. Dean knew how good he was with a gun, but he also knew how risky it was, shooting to <em>not </em>kill. Humans were an all-around pain in the ass when it came to hunting. Give him a poltergeist any day of the week.
    
    The third figure disappeared with a panicked cry as he turned his gun on it, before he could even shoot, and Dean blinked, staring at the empty space where it had been standing. He recognized his mistake immediately, seeing the second figure he'd taken out raising its wand again out of the corner of his eye, but he was turning too slowly to shoot it first -
    
    A wave of red light struck the masked figure and it collapsed, the wand slipping out of its fingers and rolling across the forest floor. Dean snapped his head round and stared at the girl, who had turned her attention to the remaining masked figure, slumped on the ground. She raised her wand, opening her mouth, but the figure disappeared before she could say anything.
    
    Dean stared around for a moment, and then pointed his gun at the girl.
    
    She was watching him now, her wand aimed at him, and ridiculous though it was to feel threatened by a piece of wood, Dean had seen what she could do with it and he <em>really</em> didn't like it. She might have saved his life by taking out the masked figure that had been about to attack him, but that didn't mean much.
    
    The girl frowned at him slightly, as if he'd said something that had confused her, and lowered her wand. "Are you Martin?"
    
    Dean stared at her, not lowering his gun yet. Her accent was weird... British, maybe? "What?"
    
    "Martin," the girl said patiently, as if they were having the conversation over coffee in a diner. "Are you Martin Miggs?"
    
    "...No," Dean said, and finally lowered his gun. She seemed far too calm to be about to try to kill him. "Is that who you were looking for? Who are you?"
    
    "Oh no, I wasn't looking for Martin," the girl said serenely. "I just thought, with the gun, you might be him. It's still nice to meet you, though." She frowned down at her injured arm as if wondering what had happened to it.
    
    "Who are you?" Dean demanded again, trying not to get side-tracked. He started walking cautiously across the clearing towards her. "What are you doing out here? What the hell's going on?"
    
    The girl looked up at him again, unblinking. "I'm Luna. Luna Lovegood. And I think... I think a Wrackspurt may have caught me."
    
    Before Dean could even try to make any sense out of that, her eyes rolled back and she collapsed to the ground, unconscious.
    
    <hr>
    
    The cut on her arm looked nasty, particularly since he didn't have a first-aid kit with him. He wasn't sure whether it was what had made her pass out or not, though. It was bleeding pretty heavily, but hardly 'spurting'. Assuming that was even what she'd been talking about.
    
    Then again, people said some pretty weird things when they were on the verge of passing out. Sam had once sworn blind, past the point of all reason, that Dean had dyed his hair blond while they'd been separated - for five minutes, and in a haunted house without working plumbing, so when and where Dean was meant to have done it only Sam knew - and Dean had been on the point of demanding to know whether his brother needed his eyes tested when Sam had taken a swandive, which had at least cleared up that mystery. So maybe the girl had just been talking nonsense.
    
    He ripped off the tattered sleeve of her robe and used it to bandage the wound, the best he could do until they got back to the Impala. Assuming they made it back. Dean no longer knew which direction he'd come running from when he'd seen the lights, and he couldn't trust his compass. On the other hand, he didn't want to just hang around when there was a chance the masked figures might come back. And the one still lying there wasn't dead and might wake up from whatever the girl had done to him at any moment.
    
    He swore and levered the girl to her feet, then gave up and hauled her up into his arms. Hopefully she would wake up soon, because he didn't think he could carry her the whole way back to the car, even if he did somehow manage to find the way. He hesitated, then tentatively reached down for her wand, bracing himself, half-expecting it to give him an electric shock. But he felt nothing when he touched it. Oddly, that seemed even less reassuring. He slid it into his pocket anyway, readjusted his grip on the girl, and set off, judging the direction as best he could.
    
    By the time she sighed a little and opened her eyes ten minutes later, Dean had long since reached the conclusion that he was hopelessly lost, and it was a relief to have a distraction. He lowered her to the ground and fished out his bottle of drinking water.
    
    "Hey. You awake?"
    
    She looked at him with a vagueness that made him worry she might be worse injured than he'd thought. "Oh. Martin."
    
    "Not Martin," Dean said. "Dean. Here, have some water."
    
    She took a sip and blinked at him. "You don't look like Dean. Do you draw, too?"
    
    "...No," Dean said. "I'm - another Dean, I guess."
    
    "Oh. What do you do, then?" the girl asked conversationally.
    
    <em>Man, shouldn't she be making more sense now she's awake?</em> "I - I hunt. Look, who are you?"
    
    "I told you, I'm Luna," she said. "You got rid of the Wrackspurt, didn't you? Thank you, Dean."
    
    Deciding that debating that issue was only going to derail the conversation further, Dean said, "You're welcome. So what are you, Luna? A witch, or something?"
    
    "Yes, I'm a witch," Luna said. She was watching him with an uncomfortably direct gaze now. "And you're a Muggle, aren't you? I wasn't very good at Muggle Studies, I'm afraid."
    
    <em>God, I hate witches. Though since when do witches really wave goddamn <strong>wands </strong>about?</em> His train of thought was interrupted again, though. "Muggle?"
    
    "A non-wizard," Luna said. "Is there a reason we're sitting in the middle of the woods? I'm sure they're nice woods, but the Death Eaters will probably come back."
    
    <em>Death Eaters?</em> "I - we're lost. My compass won't show the right way out here -" Dean paused. "Which, I'm guessing, is down to something you lot have done, yeah? Any chance you could sort that out, sweetheart? Because we could be sitting out in these woods for a good long while, otherwise."
    
    He took satisfaction in seeing <em>Luna </em>blink in confusion for once. "There..." She hesitated, frowning, before suddenly nodding as if she'd figured something out. "There's a house near here - hidden from Muggles. There are protections against Muggle devices. Do you have my wand?"
    
    Dean eyed her. "In my pocket. But why should I give it to you?"
    
    "People have been known to lose body parts, carrying wands in their pockets," Luna said dreamily. "Sometimes quite important body parts."
    
    Dean pulled out the wand hastily. Luna smiled at him, and he honestly couldn't tell whether she was laughing at him or not.
    
    "I can find the way, if you give it to me," she said. "Or we could sit here a while longer. These really are nice woods." She looked around with apparently genuine interest.
    
    Dean shook his head and passed her the wand. They were going to wander around forever if they couldn't find a way out, and he didn't think he'd be able to handle her weird style of conversation for that long.
    
    Luna balanced the wand carefully on her palm and whispered, "<em>Point me</em>."
    
    Dean watched skeptically, then felt his mouth drop open as the wand spun of its own accord to point in a different direction. He shut his mouth again immediately - it was stupid, after the fight he'd just seen, to be weirded out by sight of something as minor as that, but there was something creepier about it than the jets of light they'd all been shooting around the place.
    
    "That's north," Luna said brightly. "Which way do we have to go?"
    
    <hr>
    
    It took more than two hours in the dark to reach the Impala, and by the time they got there Luna was almost out again, stumbling along. Dean had been forced to wrap his arm around her to support her, against his better judgment. It saved on time wasted when she stopped to apologize to the trees she bumped into, though.
    
    Yeah, Dean wasn't even going to think about that one.
    
    He opened the back door of the car and lowered her onto the bench seat, returning a few moments later with the first-aid kit. He unwrapped the robe from around her arm and examined the wound. It could probably use a few stitches, but it could wait until - 
    
    ...Was he seriously planning to take her back to the motel to patch her up? Dean bit his lip and stared at the girl slumped in the back seat. Disturbing though the idea was, he could only imagine the havoc Luna would manage to cause at a hospital. He might be able to explain away her strange clothes and accent, but not so much her... general weirdness. Besides, he still didn't really know what was going on in the woods. From what she'd said, those masked figures might come back any time, and he still didn't know who they were or what they wanted.
    
    <em>...Son of a bitch</em>.
    
    Dean pushed the girl properly into the car and closed the door, then climbed in the front. It was going to be a long night.
    
    <hr>
    
    Cleaning the wound took him a while: traipsing through the woods hadn't done it any good, despite his makeshift bandage.
    
    "Shouldn't it be healing by now?"
    
    Dean looked up, startled; he hadn't realized she was conscious. Luna was watching him with mild interest.
    
    "I'm just cleaning it," Dean said, clearing his throat. "I think it may need stitches."
    
    "I've seen stitches before," Luna said gravely. "But I still have my wand. I'm sure I'll be strong enough to heal it in the morning."
    
    Dean stared at her. "What, just like that? A wave of the wand, and that's it?"
    
    "Normally we use potions," Luna said. "But there's a lot you can do with a wand. Of course, you can only heal yourself up to a certain point. Then you're in too much pain to concentrate properly, and it can get a bit counterproductive. But once I've had some sleep I'm sure I'll manage."
    
    Dean gave up. Potions? Wands? Magical healing? He wasn't going to deal with any of that shit tonight. "Fine, whatever." He slapped a clean bandage on her arm; let her worry about it in the morning with her hocus pocus.
    
    "Is this your home?" Luna asked, glancing around.
    
    "No," Dean said. "It's a motel." At her frown, he added, "Like... a place where you rent a room."
    
    "Oh, I see," Luna said, her frown evaporating. "We have them too, we just don't call them that. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?"
    
    Dean looked at her arm. "You can stay." He looked up sharply at her face. "You can stay because I've got a lot of questions I want answered, sweetheart. And in the morning you're going to answer them. Got that?"
    
    "Yes," Luna agreed calmly. "Thank you." She reached down and began to maneuver the weird black robe she was wearing carefully over her arm and head. Dean shut his mouth with a snap and turned away quickly, caught off-guard. Then glanced over his shoulder, sneaking a peek at pale skin marred by an occasional bruise and a long, thin scar down her back. He made himself look away again.
    
    Once she was safely - albeit nakedly, <em>Jesus</em>, though he should have been expecting it, since she hadn't exactly had a suitcase of clothes with her - beneath the covers, Dean snapped off the lights and quickly stripped down to his shorts, feeling oddly exposed even though there was no way Luna could see anything. He wasn't really planning to sleep, not with some crazy chick in the room with him and no one there to watch his back, but if he pretended, he stood a better chance of avoiding any more weird conversations with her.
    
    "Don't go trying any hocus pocus on me in the middle of the night," he warned her gruffly, sliding into his own bed.
    
    "I won't," she said seriously.
    
    It shouldn't have reassured him, but it did. Dean lay there and listened to her breathing as it smoothed out. It was weird, having someone sleeping in the same room as him again. He'd picked up a few chicks since... well, since, but he'd taken very few of them back to his room, and none had stayed the night.
    
    Would it be so bad if he closed his eyes? She'd saved his life back in those woods, probably, even if he had returned the favour. If she'd been going to abracadabra him, she could have done it back there.
    
    Anyway. Even if she did, would it really matter?
    
    <hr>
    
    It was the whisper that woke him the next morning - words that his half-asleep mind didn't understand, but he knew there shouldn't be <em>any</em> words being whispered in his motel room. He jolted to a sitting position, knife already in his hand.
    
    The girl was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the other bed, holding her wand against the arm that had been injured. Even as Dean watched, though, she lowered the wand again, her arm unmarked as if nothing had ever happened. She looked up at Dean and smiled.
    
    "Good morning. That's an interesting knife."
    
    Dean reluctantly stuck it back under his pillow. Luna smiled wider and tucked her wand behind her ear. Dean narrowed his eyes - it wasn't coincidence that she'd put her weapon away as soon as he had his. He was quickly coming to the conclusion that, weird or not, this girl wasn't half as oblivious to what was going on around her as she seemed.
    
    "How's your arm?" he asked, after an awkward moment's silence.
    
    "Oh, it's fine now, thanks," Luna said, glancing down at it.
    
    "Useful trick," Dean observed, thinking back to a dozen times when he or his father had been injured and he would have killed for that ability.
    
    "I'm no Healer," Luna confessed. "All I really know is basic first-aid and few tricks I've picked up. But it's a handy skill to have, especially these days."
    
    "About that," Dean started, then stopped. There was no way he could handle all of this without something to eat. "On second thought, you hungry?"
    
    "A bit, yes," she said. "We didn't have much chance to eat, the last few days."
    
    "Okay." Dean eyed her. "Can I trust you to stay here and not cause any trouble while I grab a shower? And then we can go find somewhere to eat, and you can fill me in on what the hell is going on here."
    
    Luna smiled again. "I'll be good."
    
    Well, she hadn't killed him in his sleep, so it was probably safe enough. Dean slid out of bed and headed for the bathroom, only to stutter to a halt halfway there, suddenly realizing - at the feeling of her eyes on him - that he was only wearing his shorts. He hastily grabbed a change of clothes from his bag and shut the bathroom door behind him, all without looking back.

    Section 4: Deals<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>For the next arn, everything around D'argo melted away until only he, Chiana, and the healer existed. Clamping down on his emotions, he helped the old Qujagan woman clean and bandage his lover's many wounds. And he wasn't going to think about it. No, because if he thought about it he would take on the planet single handedly until he found those who had done this to her. And then he would rip them apart alive until their screams drained away with their lives.</p>
    <p>"I've done all I can," the healer's soft voice said. "Her bandages need to be changed every few arns. It would be better if she sleeps. There is much pain."</p>
    <p>D'argo nodded, not trusting himself to speak. Blue blood was already beginning to seep through the first bandages they had tied. If not for her shallow breathing, Chiana almost looked like she was merely sleeping.</p>
    <p>"Is it safe to move her?" he asked. The healer shrugged.</p>
    <p>"There is much pain," she repeated. "It would hurt, but she needs care more." The healer's hand ghosted along the side of Chiana's face, careful not to disturb her wounds. "May Ekan look gladly upon you, child," she whispered. With a sad smile for D'argo, she stood and left.</p>
    <p>"I talked to Pilot," said Rygel. "Norianti will be ready when we get back to Moya."</p>
    <p>"Good." D'argo looked up at the humans that had found Chiana. "We should take them with us," he said.</p>
    <p>"Right, just what we need. Four more humans to get us into trouble."</p>
    <p>Before D'argo could reply, the human that had carried Chiana spoke again. "Will she be okay?" he asked.</p>
    <p>The Luxan looked back at the still Nebari before answering. "She should be eventually. We need to get her back to our ship though," he turned back to he humans. "You should probably come with us."</p>
    <p>"Do you mind if we have a little chit-chat before you start making the honeymoon plans?" the gray-haired man sitting by the door asked. D'argo nodded briefly, missing neither the cold glare nor the sarcasm. They had the time to spare, and he had questions of his own - like how the hell four humans with guns got to this end of Tormented Space. Not to mention the fact that they appeared to find all of this normal. They were very different from the majority of the humans D'argo had met on Earth.</p>
    <p>"I don't think we've been properly introduced yet," said the man who had carried Chiana. "My name is Daniel Jackson from the planet Earth. This is Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter, and Teal'c." They all stood as he indicated each in turn. Both his voice and motions were gentle; Jackson obviously didn't want to offend them. He wore a weapon on his thigh though, and appeared more than capable of using it. O'Neill was the wary gray-haired man well armed with a guarded expression. D'argo recognized his rank as important and nodded to him in acknowledgement. The woman was also well armed but her face was softer and more open. The dark skinned man was Teal'c who had stood silent and motionless by the door since they had arrived. The perfect soldier. D'argo didn't like him.</p>
    <p>"You said you were D'argo and - "</p>
    <p>"Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth of the Hynerian Empire," Rygel interrupted Jackson. D'argo rolled his eyes and got to his feet, moving so that he was between Chiana and the strangers. "As you should know since we were on your planet half a cycle ago."</p>
    <p>The four humans looked at each other, clearly surprised. "You were on our planet?" asked Daniel Jackson.</p>
    <p>"Yes, for over a monen," Rygel continued coldly. "That's where we learned to speak your language. What I want to know is how you got here."</p>
    <p>"We would have known if you had landed on our planet," said O'Neill, not believing them. "We would have been the first to know."</p>
    <p>D'argo and Rygel exchanged a look, each asking the other, How could they not know? "This can't be good," D'argo said in his own language so the humans couldn't understand. Not only should they have been recognized from the TV, but there was no way the humans could have gotten out here without the wormhole that Pilot and John had effectively collapsed forever.</p>
    <p>"Dominar," Jackson said eliciting a surprised but nevertheless smug smile on Rygel's lips, "when do you think you were on Earth?"</p>
    <p>"At your Christmas," Rygel replied, more warmly than before. D'argo fought the urge to roll his eyes.</p>
    <p>"You shouldn't have the capability to get here," he added. The humans glanced at each other again. D'argo could see that they were a very close- knit group. He wondered if they would help him get John and Aeryn back. Since Chiana had been his only other reliable fighter, it would be nice to have the extra firepower.</p>
    <p>"Jack, I think we should tell them," said Jackson quietly. "I think we can trust them, and they might be able to help."</p>
    <p>O'Neill glanced briefly at his subordinate, then at Chiana then back at D'argo who calmly met his gaze. This was not the time to flinch.</p>
    <p>"We came here through the stargate," said O'Neill.</p>
    <p>"And what's that?" D'argo had never heard of it.</p>
    <p>"It's a device that creates a wormhole between two places in space," Carter explained.</p>
    <p>"Wormhole?" Rygel glared at D'argo as if it were his fault. The Luxan sighed heavily himself.</p>
    <p>"A subspace - "</p>
    <p>"We know what wormholes are," D'argo cut her off, rubbing his eyes tiredly. Did they ever know! "Where is this device? Is it a ship?" he asked.</p>
    <p>"No," said O'Neill. "It's a metal ring. The one here is in a junkyard."</p>
    <p>"Where you found Chiana?"</p>
    <p>O'Neill nodded.</p>
    <p>"Can you work it?"</p>
    <p>Again, the four traded looks. "No," Carter replied. "The device we normally use to dial home with is missing. And we don't have a power source to do it manually."</p>
    <p>"So you are stranded," said Rygel. "Four humans who know about wormholes stuck on this hostile planet. D'argo's right. You better come with us if you don't want to get yourselves killed."</p>
    <p>"Why? What's the danger?" asked O'Neill.</p>
    <p>"Two of our friends were kidnapped by the government here. We found out it's because they are unknown aliens. One of them is human," said D'argo meeting the other man's eyes. "He has also had a price on his head for the last three cycles because he knows about wormholes. You are in a lot of danger, and not just from the people here."</p>
    <p>"And you'd be willing to help us?" asked Carter. She traded another look with O'Neill. "At what price?"</p>
    <p>D'argo grinned. "You help me break my friends out. Chiana's too injured to help, and Rygel's too small to hold a decent weapon."</p>
    <p>"I am not small! I am well proportioned," declared the Hynerian with a sniff.</p>
    <p>D'argo snorted. "Yeah, you keep telling yourself that." He turned back to the humans. "That leaves just me."</p>
    <p>"It seems like your getting more out of this deal than us," said O'Neill. "Not that I doubt you, which I actually do, but we help you in exchange for . . .?" he lifted his eyebrows, "Nothing?"</p>
    <p>Now that he thought about it, D'argo admitted that it did sound like half the deals he and Moya's crew kept getting handed. "Crichton knows about wormholes. He's the only one that does in this part of space. From what we know about your planet, you shouldn't be able to be here. He might be able to get you back."</p>
    <p>"Oh that's easy," Rygel grumbled. "Just have to reform a collapsed wormhole."</p>
    <p>Ignoring him, D'argo added, "Or we'll find you a power source for your machine."</p>
    <p>"And if we don't help?" asked O'Neill.</p>
    <p>D'argo again looked at Rygel and saw the sad understanding there. "Then you walk away now. We won't stop you. I'll rescue my friends on my own, and you will have to find your own power source without getting captured yourself." His Hynerian friend looked away. D'argo turned back to O'Neill whose sarcastic expression had changed to understanding. "What will it be?"</p>
    <p>"Looks like you made yourself a deal," said O'Neill.</p>
    <p>"Thank you."</p>
    <p>"So what's next? Your ship?" The human commander was all business now.</p>
    <p>"Yeah," D'argo replied, this time turning to gather Chiana carefully in his arms, his returned anger warring with the urge to cry for her pain. "Pilot, Stark, and Norianti are waiting for us."</p>
    <p>"I though you said you were alone?" queried Jackson.</p>
    <p>"To fight, yes. Pilot can't leave Moya, and Stark and Norianti are a little . . ."</p>
    <p>"Insane," Rygel finished while D'argo was still searching for nicer words. "Crichton unhinged was more stable than those two."</p>
    <p>"Rygel, shut up," D'argo sighed as he followed the Hynerian from the room followed by their mysterious human allies.</p>

    once upon a time in land not so far away, the denizens of yulechat, scattered across the globe, all found themselves in the grave peril. for traveling through the channel was a most fearsome grue!
    
    "o noes" they cried. whatever could they do?
    
    but then there came a thundering, echoing throughout the channel. the hippos were rising up out of their repose, ready to fight off the invader. they danced and they danced, tangoing and pirouetting in all caps.
    
    so powerful was their artistry, and graceful their movements, that the grue fell, slain by their power of awesome. all of yulechat rejoiced! there were cabana boys, orgies and hot chocolate for all!
    
    all was well, until out of the darkness came a low voice moaning for brains. It was a zombie grue!
    
    plz read and respnd! :):) if 20 gagillion ppl comment i'll post the next part!

    THE CLERK'S TALE\r\n\
    Part I\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ther is, right at the west syde of ytaille,\r\n\
    Doun at the roote of vesulus the colde,\r\n\
    A lusty playn, habundant of vitaille,\r\n\
    Where many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde,\r\n\
    That founded were in tyme of fadres olde,\r\n\
    And many another delitable sighte,\r\n\
    And saluces this noble contree highte.\r\n\
    A markys whilom lord was of that lond,\r\n\
    As were his worthy eldres hym bifore;\r\n\
    And obeisant, ay redy to his hond,\r\n\
    Were alle his liges, bothe lasse and moore.\r\n\
    Thus in delit he lyveth, and hath doon yoore,\r\n\
    Biloved and drad, thurgh favour of fortune,\r\n\
    Bothe of his lordes and of his commune.\r\n\
    Therwith he was, to speke as of lynage,\r\n\
    The gentillest yborn of lumbardye,\r\n\
    A fair persone, and strong, and yong of age,\r\n\
    And ful of honour and of curteisye;\r\n\
    Discreet ynogh his contree for to gye,\r\n\
    Save in somme thynges that he was to blame;\r\n\
    And walter was this yonge lordes name.\r\n\
    I blame hym thus, that he considered noght\r\n\
    In tyme comynge what myghte hym bityde,\r\n\
    But on his lust present was al his thoght,\r\n\
    As for to hauke and hunte on every syde.\r\n\
    Wel ny alle othere cures leet he slyde,\r\n\
    And eek he nolde -- and that was worst of alle --\r\n\
    Wedde no wyf, for noght that may bifalle.\r\n\
    Oonly that point his peple bar so soore\r\n\
    That flokmeele on a day they to hym wente,\r\n\
    And oon of he, that wisest was of loore --\r\n\
    Or elles that the lord best wolde assente\r\n\
    That he sholde telle hym what his peple mente,\r\n\
    Or elles koude he shewe wel swich mateere --\r\n\
    He to the markys seyde as ye shul heere:\r\n\
    O noble markys, youre humanitee\r\n\

    As ofte as tyme is of necessitee,\r\n\

    That for to been a wedded man yow leste;\r\n\
    Thanne were youre peple in sovereyn hertes reste.\r\n\

    Of sovereynetee, noght of servyse,\r\n\

    That we shul deye, as uncerteyn we alle\r\n\

    The diner was almost deserted, much to Dean's relief: Luna was taking everything in with an undisguised curiosity that was bound to attract attention. And that wasn't even taking into account what she was wearing. Dean had finally made her put his leather jacket on over her robes, in the hope of passing them off as a dress or something. With that and the wand - now stuck in her hair, which she'd put up in some weird knot - Dean was just relieved that there weren't more people around to stare at them.
    
    "So," Dean said, to take his mind off the way she looked with his jacket almost swallowing her up. "You owe me a lot of answers, sweetheart."
    
    Luna nodded and took a sip of orange juice. "I suppose so. Where do you want me to start?"
    
    "How about you tell me what you were doing out in those woods, and who the guys in black were?" Dean suggested.
    
    "They were Death Eaters," Luna said.
    
    Dean raised his eyebrows expectantly. "I'm guessing you don't mean cannibals."
    
    Luna looked thoughtful. "Not that I'm aware of. Although with some of them it might explain a thing or two. No, the Death Eaters are the followers of the Dark Lord..."
    
    The explanation was long and complicated, even without taking into account Luna's habit of going off on strange tangents. Finally Dean held up a hand to stop her. "Okay, hold up. Let me see if I've got this straight. So there's, like, a whole wizarding world out there and right now it's at war because some asshole with a thing for melodramatic titles wants to take over?"
    
    "I can't tell you his name," Luna said. "They put a curse on it, so they would know every time someone said it. Though it wasn't his real name anyway. It seems silly to go to all the trouble of changing your name if you're not going to let anyone use the new one afterwards. He could have just stuck with his real name. But the Dark Lord can be a bit stupid sometimes."
    
    "...Right," Dean said. "So this 'Dark Lord' decides it would be great if nobody could kill him, and basically chops up bits of his <em>soul</em>?" It sounded weird, but Dean had seen too many fucked-up things over the years to disbelieve her because of that alone.
    
    "They get stored in objects," Luna said gravely. "He can't be killed unless we find and destroy all of them. Some of them we've already dealt with - an old diary and a ring. Some of them haven't been found, but we know what they are, or think we do. Harry -"
    
    "That's your friend, the kid you said he didn't manage to kill," Dean interrupted, double-checking he was still following her wandering explanation.
    
    "Yes, that's right," Luna said. "Harry Potter. Harry can't leave the country at the moment - he and his friends have been in hiding for almost five years now, trying to avoid being captured and to find the other Horcruxes. He's the only one who can kill the Dark Lord. So we came to -"
    
    "Whoa, hold it," Dean interrupted again, his attention still caught by what she'd just said. "They're trying to find <em>what</em>?"
    
    "The Horcruxes," Luna repeated. "That's what the objects bound to the bits of soul are called."
    
    Dean stared at her. "A <em>whore-crux</em>? You've gotta be kidding me."
    
    Luna blinked at him serenely, just the faintest upturn at the corner of her mouth to hint that she might understand his reaction. "Harry and his friends have found and destroyed a few of them already," she went on. "But there are a few we haven't found yet. We think the Dark Lord gave one to Bellatrix Lestrange for safe-keeping - she's one of his most loyal followers, a very powerful witch. And a bit crazy."
    
    "And you think she brought it here? Why <em>here</em>?" Dean demanded, regretfully tabling his Horcrux jokes for the time being.
    
    "We think she kept whatever it is in her bank vault to begin with," Luna said. "But when she realized Harry knew about it, she escaped with it. We don't know for certain whether she brought it here, but she and her husband have three houses in your country. It's... difficult to get in and out of Britain at the moment, so we think she decided that taking it out of the country was the safest way to keep it away from us."
    
    "And one of these houses is out in the woods near here," Dean said. "So you and your friend -" He noticed the flicker of pain that passed over Luna's face, but kept going. "- You were checking out the house. Did you find the... the whore - Did you find it?"
    
    "No," Luna said quietly, looking down at her glass. "We were still searching when the Death Eaters - the Dark Lord's followers - found us. We tried to get away - we wanted to go back later, try again - but there were too many of them, and one of them managed to hit Ginny with an Unforgivable Curse."
    
    Dean couldn't help but feel sorry at the look on Luna's face. "She gonna be okay?"
    
    Luna turned her glass around and around. "I don't know. I activated my Portkey - it's a magical object which transports you over long distances. It should have taken her back to Britain, to a safe place. They'll do what they can to help her."
    
    "Hey, you healed your cut like it was nothing," Dean reminded her, wondering why he was trying to cheer her up. "I bet she'll be fine."
    
    Luna shook her head slowly. "The curse they used on her... it causes pain. Imagine the most pain you've ever felt in your entire life, and then multiply it by... a lot."
    
    Dean couldn't help but remember the necromancer he'd run into three weeks ago. The scar on the back of his neck seemed to burn again as he thought about it.
    
    "Concentrated pain," Luna said, barely above a whisper. "It drives the victim mad, sooner or later. The Death Eaters held it on her for... a minute or two, I don't know how long exactly. She was screaming." She lifted her glass and took another sip of her juice. "So I don't know if she'll be okay. I hope so. Ginny's a good friend. But I've no way to get in touch with anyone to find out."
    
    Dean took a swallow of his coffee. It wasn't like there was anything he could say to make it better.
    
    "So," he said after a moment. "What's your plan now? Head back home?"
    
    "No," Luna said. "I have to go back to the house and look again."
    
    Dean frowned at her. "How do you know the guys in the masks won't come back again?"
    
    "I don't," Luna said. "But I need to find out whether the Horcrux is there or not."
    
    Dean thought about it, then shrugged. Wasn't like it was any of his business, whether she wanted to get herself killed or not. On the other hand, he was there to stop any more innocent people from getting murdered by witches and evil wizards and whatever the fuck else.
    
    "Fine," he said shortly, setting his cup down on the table with a hard <em>clack</em>. "We'll both go."
    
    Luna met his eyes, looking surprised for the first time since he'd met her. "Why?"
    
    "People have been dying in those woods," Dean reminded her. "I want it stopped. You're a witch, right? There's got to be something you can do."
    
    Luna looked thoughtful. "I might be able to tamper with the protections on the house..."
    
    "Right," Dean said, and got to his feet. "So let's go."
    
    <hr>
    
    The walk through the woods took a while, and the way Luna kept her wand in her hand made Dean even more nervous, even if she just seemed to be using it to figure out what direction they should be going.
    
    Dean didn't break the silence between them, busy thinking about what she'd told him. Crazy though it was, he believed her. He'd seen too many fucked-up things to discount it just because of how weird it was. And the fight he'd witnessed did a lot to sell her story. Fine. It didn't mean he was about to start trusting her. Even if she was on the 'good' side of whatever crazy war was going on in her world, it didn't change the fact that she was a witch. And Dean wasn't about to start trusting goddamn witches any time soon.
    
    Luna paused and Dean eyed her edgily. "What?"
    
    "The clearing where we fought the Death Eaters should be just up ahead," Luna said. "It would be safer to circle round it, but I'd like to check whether our things are still there."
    
    "Things?" Dean asked warily.
    
    "Belongings," Luna said vaguely. "Supplies." She started moving again, wand still in her hand.
    
    Dean muttered a curse under his breath and went with her, pulling out his gun.
    
    The clearing was deserted, but Luna didn't appear to relax, and Dean couldn't either, not with the memory of the way the masked figures had just <em>vanished </em>the day before. He figured he couldn't count on seeing or hearing them approaching through the woods.
    
    Damn, but he hated magic.
    
    Luna was looking around, her expression distracted. She moved to the side of the clearing where she'd fought the day before, and he saw her eyes land on the bloodstained ground where her friend had been lying. She didn't say anything, however, just continued on, studying the ground now. Dean followed, splitting his attention between keeping an eye on her and watching out for evil magicians teleporting in.
    
    Luna paused at the far edge of the clearing, crouching down and parting the bushes, standing up again a moment later with two small bags in her hand. Her attention was on the ground again, and she walked slowly around the edge of the clearing.
    
    "What are you looking for?" Dean asked finally.
    
    "Ginny's wand," Luna replied. "It might not be here any more, if the Death Eaters came back and found it, but..." She paused, then flourished her own wand. "<em>Accio</em>, Ginny's wand!"
    
    Dean took an involuntary step back as a wand flew out of a crack between two tree roots and into Luna's hand.
    
    "That must come in handy when you lose your keys," he said, trying not to let it unsettle him too much.
    
    "You Muggles use keys more than we do," Luna said. "We usually stick to locking charms." She smiled at him, slipping the wand into one of the bags, then one bag inside the other. The remaining bag she slung over her shoulder and onto her back. "The house is this way."
    
    It was hard to follow her now, somehow. It wasn't like he couldn't see where she was going, but there was no path, and the trees and bushes seemed to be doing their best to thwart him. He kept going off-track.
    
    "Oh," Luna said suddenly, coming back to his side. "Is it hard for you to find your way?"
    
    "No," Dean said defiantly. Damned if he was going to let her show him up. "It's just a bit tricky to see the wood for the trees out here."
    
    Luna blinked at him, but before he could properly savor the triumph of confusing <em>her</em> for once, she said, "You should hold my hand."
    
    Dean stared at her. "Um, not that I'm complaining, sweetheart, but we only just met."
    
    "Don't worry, you don't need to be shy," Luna said, catching hold of his hand and interlacing her fingers with his. "You're not a wizard, so the protections on the house are trying to turn you away. If we hold hands, the house knows you're with me and leaves you in peace."
    
    She started walking again and Dean went with her, trying not to think about the cool hand in his.
    
    "Thought there'd be more hocus-pocus involved," he muttered. "Not just <em>holding hands</em>."
    
    "Holding hands can be very powerful," Luna said dreamily. "Like the old handfasting ceremonies when people got married..."
    
    Dean only just stopped himself from yanking his hand away. "<em>What</em>?"
    
    "Besides, just casting a spell wouldn't have been nearly as much fun," Luna said.
    
    Dean looked at her suspiciously, but her serene expression gave nothing away.

    Section 33: Day On<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Jack was enjoying his day off. Last night had been nice in the company of others, but now was time to be alone, and it was time he treasured. He had a nice late start followed by the relaxing pleasure of watching the hockey game his faithful VCR had taped for him while he had been offworld. He was halfway through the third period with the Kings scoring point for point against the Sharks when the phone rang. He almost didn't answer it.</p>
    <p>With a sigh, he pressed pause. "Hello."</p>
    <p>"Colonel O'Neill, this is Corporal Sanders. The General needs you to come in for a meeting about your last mission, sir."</p>
    <p>Jack's heart sank. So much for a day off. "Alright, I'm on my way. Has the rest of my team been called in?" By rest of his team, he meant Daniel since Janet hadn't wanted Carter on her own in her house and had thus confined the Major to the infirmary.</p>
    <p>"No, sir."</p>
    <p>"I'll take care of it. Thanks." He hung up and gazed mournfully at the paused game. It would be there when he got back he supposed. Still, nothing to ruin his day off like a call from the base. He rang up Daniel then grabbed his jacket and was out the door.</p>
    <p>One drive, three checkpoints, and two elevators later, Jack was striding down the halls of the SGC. He met Daniel in the locker room where they both quickly changed into blue uniforms.</p>
    <p>"Any idea what this is about?" asked Daniel.</p>
    <p>"Nope," said Jack. "Though it better be good. It's five to four in the third period and I'm not waiting another week to see who wins." Daniel gave him a blank look before following him out the door to the briefing room.</p>
    <p>They were the last to arrive. General Hammond sat at his usual place at the head of the table. Dr. Frasier and two other men Jack didn't recognize sat on his left, both wearing Major's insignia. On the right Major Davis, the SGC's Pentagon liaison, sat with a two star General. Their guests looked up in surprise when they entered.</p>
    <p>"Ah, Colonel O'Neill, Dr. Jackson," General Hammond greeted them. "This is General Forge and Drs. Rhodes and Dendron. They're with the medical group at Area 51 that studies the Goa'uld. And they are very interested in our guest, Mr. D'argo."</p>
    <p>"General, Majors," Jack nodded to them before sitting gingerly at the table next to Dr. Rhodes. Daniel took the seat next to the General.</p>
    <p>"General Hammond, what is this?" Forge demanded sharply. He looked appraisingly over Jack and Daniel, trying to figure out what Hammond was playing at. Jack had a pretty good idea.</p>
    <p>"General Forge here read Dr. Frasier's report on the poisonous properties of our guest's blood," Hammond ignored Forge's question and instead gave his men a pointed look.</p>
    <p>"General," said Forge.</p>
    <p>"Forgive me, General Forge," Hammond turned his attention back to the visitor. "Colonel O'Neill and Dr. Jackson were the ones who made first contact with Mr. D'argo and his people. I think it only prudent that you are aware of the political ramifications of your request."</p>
    <p>"And what request would that be?" asked Daniel.</p>
    <p>"In order to do the necessary research they need a supply of the toxin in his blood," said Doc Frasier. "And until we can produce it ourselves . . . "</p>
    <p>"You need the source," Jack finished. "Didn't we already go through this with Teal'c?"</p>
    <p>"Colonel, I'm sure you can appreciate the difference between the situations," said Forge down his nose. "Here we have a known poison that has proven very effective against the Goa'uld. This will not be a random study."</p>
    <p>"I'm sure he'll appreciate that," Jack smiled sarcastically. "Have you even asked him?"</p>
    <p>"He hasn't woken up yet," said Dr. Frasier.</p>
    <p>"Colonel," Davis spoke up, "the Pentagon is looking very closely at this matter. We're here to ask for his help now."</p>
    <p>Jack looked at Daniel who replied with a silent lift of his eyebrows before looking down at the table. They both heard Davis's unspoken warning that the Pentagon might not be in an asking mood later.</p>
    <p>"Enough stalling," said Forge impatiently. "This is a waste of time. General Hammond, I have orders here and unless you want me to report on your obstruction of those orders, you will let me and my men inspect the alien."</p>
    <p>Hammond visibly bristled. "And I'm sure, General Forge, that you can appreciate the diplomatic implications of treating a guest of this facility as a lab rat. Now before I let you anywhere near Mr. D'argo, you will listen to Colonel O'Neill's assessment of the political situation. Colonel?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir," said Jack though he had no idea what to say. He didn't think escaped prisoners really factored into political situations.</p>
    <p>"General, if I may," Daniel came to Jack's rescue. Hammond nodded for him to continue. "Mr. D'argo is actually Captain D'argo. His ship and most of his crew are waiting for him in their reality. You know about the faulty stargate that took us to their reality?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, what does that have to do - "</p>
    <p>Daniel spoke over Forge's impatient reply. "It was his scientists that figured out a way to get us back to our reality. Since the stargate was in hostile territory, Captain D'argo was forced to come with us when we were attacked. We discussed this as possibility, but if he and his two soldiers that are also here are not returned soon, you can bet that his crew will stop at nothing to get him back."</p>
    <p>"The crew of one ship?" Forge asked incredulously.</p>
    <p>"General, the hangar of this ship could eat an aircraft carrier for breakfast," said Jack. Not that it was filled with anything, but he wasn't going to tell him that.</p>
    <p>"But according to your report, they can only get into our reality. They don't know the coordinates of Earth." General Forge said smugly. "I don't think they'll be giving us any trouble. My orders stand. General Hammond, if you're quite through."</p>
    <p>Hammond glared at him. "General - "</p>
    <p>"General Hammond," Forge but him off crisply. "My orders supercede any of your protests. Until the President orders otherwise, you will give me my patient."</p>
    <p>Jack watched his CO simmer with repressed rage. "Don't think this is over."</p>
    <p>"Yes, it is. Now take me to my alien."</p>
    <p>Janet tried to protest, but the General politely ignored her using his own doctors as his ammunition against her. At Hammond's shake of the head, Jack and Daniel held their own protests as an airman led General Forge to the infirmary. Hammond retreated to his office and the red phone. They had lost this round, but they were not going to lose the next.</p>

    Section 34: More Problems, More Plans<p>************************************************************************ ************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"Shall we go visit Sam?" Jack turned to Daniel with an unhappy grimace as they walked down the hall. But Daniel shook his head.</p>
    <p>"Teal'c is there with her. We need to let John and Aeryn know. I don't think they're going to take this very well." Jack gave him 'duh' look and didn't dignify it with an answer, but Daniel went on. "I'm serious, Jack. D'argo was going to go on a suicide mission into a prison filled with soldiers just to rescue his two friends. He blew a whole in the side of a building. What do you think the two of them will do?"</p>
    <p>"Alright, alright, I get the point," said Jack stepping onto the elevator and hitting the button that would take them up to the VIP quarters as opposed to the infirmary. "You don't think they'd try to spring him while he's still wounded, do you?"</p>
    <p>Daniel gave him a sideways glance. "You would."</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>"How long do we have?" asked John. His insides felt like they had been doused with ice. He looked over at Aeryn, but her formerly smiling face was closed off and worried. Before them, Jack and Daniel exchanged a glance.</p>
    <p>"The General's working on it," said Jack. "I don't know."</p>
    <p>"That doesn't give us much time," said Aeryn quietly.</p>
    <p>"Time for what?" asked Daniel with a quick worried glance at Jack. For some reason, the move annoyed John, like they were parents who knew their kids were up to something and were trying to weasel it out of them.</p>
    <p>"Hey, we're not going to let them take him," he snapped. "You say you don't want these people to get their hands on him? Then help us get him out of here before they do."</p>
    <p>"John, look, General Hammond is on the phone with the President," said Daniel. "We didn't let them take Teal'c, we're not going to let them take D'argo."</p>
    <p>"And what if the President doesn't help?" demanded John. "What then? They take him and it's too late for us to get him back!"</p>
    <p>"Hey, hey," Jack lifted a calming hand. "We didn't say we weren't going to help. We just can't do this with you two flying off the handle."</p>
    <p>"So we just wait for you to talk them out of this?" asked Aeryn. "We've dealt with madmen like this before, and they're not going to stop just because you tell them to. We have to get out of here now, before the situation gets any worse."</p>
    <p>"We need our weapons," said John. Daniel and Jack didn't protest; they didn't say anything. That in itself scared John more than their assurances that nothing would happen to D'argo. What chance did they really have of getting the President to order the dogs off?</p>
    <p>"Daniel? Wasn't Sam really interested in getting a look at their guns and how they worked or something?" asked Jack never taking his eyes of John.</p>
    <p>"What - "</p>
    <p>"And weren't you just fascinated by the artwork on D'argo's sword thing?"</p>
    <p>"Oh," said Daniel with a small grin. "Yeah, very interested,"</p>
    <p>"Thank you," said John relieved.</p>
    <p>"Don't thank us," said Jack innocently. "It's all in a day's research. If you're bored with your room, I'm sure Teal'c and Sam would enjoy showing you around the base. So if you'll excuse us, Danny has to get his toys and I have to go talk to the General about a phone call." Jack and Daniel both nodded and left.</p>
    <p>"What do you think?" John asked Aeryn when they were alone again. The stalwart warrior let out a small smile of her own.</p>
    <p>" 'If only we had a wheelbarrow, that would be something,'" she quoted the movie from the night before.</p>
    <p>John snorted at the reference. "No holocaust cloak either." He reached out and took her hand pulling her into a close hug for a moment. Aeryn relaxed against him, tension flowing through every muscle. John closed his eyes. "Why does everything happen to us?" he murmured into her loose hair.</p>
    <p>Aeryn shook her head, not bothering to answer. Instead she said quietly, "We need a back-up plan."</p>
    <p>John couldn't stop the shudder that ran through him. "I hate the back-up plan," he whispered.</p>
    <p>"Come on." Aeryn pulled back enough to kiss him lightly. "We need to get properly dressed." Letting go of each other, John's hands lingered on her waist as he followed her to the dresser where they exchanged their borrowed denim and cotton for black leather.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Winona, Aeryn's pulse pistol, and D'argo's blade were waiting for them in Daniel's office when they were ostensibly getting a tour. "He's a civilian," Jack had told them when he met them to inform them of the plan. "He can get away with it."</p>
    <p>When Daniel stepped out to get some coffee, their airman shadow waiting just outside the cracked door, John and Aeryn secreted their weapons away, all the while talking about the oddities lying about the room. John had never seen so much old junk in a room before, except on tv in some old movie. His own office at IASA had been just as cluttered at times, but this was truly amazing. Jool would drool over this room and the secrets it held. The thought brought John up short, reminding him just how far from home they really were. When Daniel returned they were more than ready to go.</p>
    <p>"Jack's with the General?" Aeryn asked. "When will he have them out of the infirmary?"</p>
    <p>"I'll call him when we get there," said Daniel. "Then they'll page General Forge and his doctors and you can kidnap your friend." He gave them a sardonic smile. "Teal'c will help you get to the gate room. No one will question you."</p>
    <p>John didn't reply. He wasn't holding his breath. He wouldn't relax until they were safely in the wormhole. How desperate was that thought?</p>
    <p>The infirmary wasn't much further and they continued on in tense silence. Only when they got there, there were too many soldiers in the hallway. And too many loud voices in the infirmary, one of them Dr. Frasier's, another one Jack's. Retreating to just out of sight, they stopped to listen.</p>
    <p>"My patient is still in recovery!" The doctor's strident tones rang out through the corridor. "To take him now would set back his recovery. If he dies then where will your research be!"</p>
    <p>Frell, John cursed, steaming from this new development. Hands braced on his hips, he looked at Aeryn who gazed back darkly, just as unhappy. "Back- up plan," she said flatly.</p>
    <p>"Back-up plan," John sighed. They turned to Daniel. John drew Winona, Aeryn drew her gun. "We're not going to hurt you," he said. Then before Daniel could say anything, John grabbed him into a headlock and rounded the corner. Five startled soldiers turned looked up and after a brief hesitation, raised their guns.</p>

    Section 5: Taxi<p>**************************************************************************** ********************************************************************</p>
    <p>"That's your ship?" O'Neill asked. He and his teammates had once more followed the two aliens through the streets of the city, this time further inward to a bustling spaceport. The ship they were now approaching was silver and, in Jack's opinion, kinda looked like a bug, rounded and squat. But hey, anything was better than pyramids.</p>
    <p>Neither D'argo nor Rygel answered his question since it obviously was their ship. All of a sudden, D'argo barked, making Jack start.</p>
    <p>"Voice recognition code," said Carter interestedly. "Is it like a password or are the sensors keyed only to your voice and speech patterns?" When D'argo ignored her, Carter just shrugged to Daniel. "Since he used his own language I'd guess that it's tied to his native language. Obviously no one here can reproduce it. There's probably a password though for when he's on his home planet. I wonder how far that is from here." Jack and Teal'c joined her and Daniel as D'argo spoke again and a door opened, a set of step stairs descending to meet them.</p>
    <p>"Cool," said O'Neill.</p>
    <p>"Sounds like he has a set of vocal commands for different functions," Daniel commented.</p>
    <p>"So what that first one was for?" asked Carter curiously.</p>
    <p>Ahead of them, Rygel had already disappeared inside. D'argo called for them to hurry up from where he waited by the steps. O'Neill prodded Carter in the ribs to get her walking again toward the ship. She hid it well, but Jack could tell from the gleam in her eyes that she couldn't wait to uncover the secrets of this unknown technology. She was just geeky that way he smiled to himself as he followed his team up the steps. The interior was small, and aside from his people, Rygel, D'argo, and the unconscious white girl, empty. Jack looked around for another door, suspicions prickling the back of his neck.</p>
    <p>"Where are your insane friends?" he asked casually. The weight of the gun in his hand all of a sudden felt very reassuring. Not that he thought they'd try anything. Just pull one over on him. And Jack didn't like the thought of that one bit.</p>
    <p>"On Moya," said Rygel as if that explained everything, "our ship."</p>
    <p>"And this is . . .?" Jack raised his eyebrows. From where he stood, this looked like a ship too.</p>
    <p>"*My* ship," D'argo answered. "Don't touch anything."</p>
    <p>"Oh. Okay." Jack relaxed slightly, still a little confused.</p>
    <p>"It's probably just a shuttle, sir," Carter whispered helpfully into his ear.</p>
    <p>"I knew that," he growled back. Carter ignored his glare and moved forward out of the way as D'argo bent to settle the girl on the floor, where apparently the passengers would be sitting too since the only chairs belonged to the pilots.</p>
    <p>"You, uh . . ."</p>
    <p>"Daniel," the archeologist supplied.</p>
    <p>"Yeah. Make sure she doesn't get jostled in the flight," D'argo ordered. "It should be a smooth ride, but just in case - "</p>
    <p>D'argo's caution was cut off by an alarm going off and a voice speaking in the language that sounded like the one he had used to open the door. "Frell!!" The giant leapt to his feet, knocked Jack out of the way and rounded on Major Carter. "You stupid woman! I told you not to touch anything!"</p>
    <p>"Now wait just a minute!" Jack threw himself between his 2IC and the raging D'argo. No way was he going off on one of his people. Jack met the alien's glare with one of his own, letting D'argo know that if he wanted to yell at her, he would have to go through O'Neill.</p>
    <p>"D'argo just fix it before we're all blown to bits!" Rygel snapped, breaking the tension. With an honest to God snarl and shake of his head, D'argo pushed both Jack and Sam toward the back and drew his gun, barking commands. Before Jack could even protest in their defense, a console opened and D'argo inserted his gun like a key. Instantly, the alarm ceased blaring. Complete silence.</p>
    <p>"What the hell just happened?!" Jack's voice snapped into the quiet like a whip.</p>
    <p>"Your stupid soldier activated the self-destruct sequence!" D'argo snarled back, fire burning in his eyes as he glared at Carter.</p>
    <p>"I didn't touch anything!" she protested. "Colonel, I swear, I was only looking."</p>
    <p>"Well your 'looking' must have involved your skin because alien DNA is what activates the self-destruct," D'argo shot back. "You can't touch any of the panels in here unless I've spit on you first."</p>
    <p>SG-1 stared at him. Jack said the first thing that came to mind. "Eww. That's just gross."</p>
    <p>D'argo rubbed a hand over his face, like a tired parent. "Just don't touch anything. And you might want to sit down for takeoff."</p>
    <p>Teal'c, Jack, and Sam sat on the floor next to Daniel and the girl. "Please put you seatbacks and tray tables in their - "</p>
    <p>"Upright and locked positions," Rygel and D'argo chorused. "Will you just shut up?"</p>
    <p>They knew? Jack turned and met his team's equally surprised looks. How could they know? The feeling that something was seriously wrong again wiggled into place at the back of Jack's neck. First, they claimed to have visited Earth, now they *knew* one of the most quoted lines in modern Earth society. But there was no way they could have landed on Earth without the SGC knowing about it. *They* had even said the humans should know about them. Jack could only hope that he hadn't led his team into another trap. He listened with half an ear as Daniel and Carter attempted to ask questions of their alien hosts, but the two, fed up and annoyed, either told them to shut up or ignored them until Sam and Daniel gave up.</p>
    <p>With a flick of his head, Jack got their attention. He nodded at their two new friends then at his weapon. Sam and Daniel traded a look then nodded. A glance at Teal'c told Jack all that he needed to know. They would be ready for anything.</p>
    <p>************************************************************************</p>
    <p>Consciousness fluttered like a butterfly through his head. It was pretty. Lots of colors on a black background. But it was cold. Everything was cold, he realized. John woke. He shivered, the hair on his body rising. "Oh God, not this again," he croaked through dry lips. Slowly, so the light wouldn't hurt too badly, he opened his eyes. Yep, he was naked.</p>

    Everyone <i>thought</i> a chat baseball game was a good idea. Except for those who lived in countries where Cricket was preferred. Or hockey. Or strip poker. But the baseball fans formed a not-so-silent minority and overruled them.
    
    It would have gone just fine except for the murder of one of the Mets. (Did I mention they were playing an "all-star" team, composed of whomever they could distract from the majors. This mostly involved Mets, who are easily distracted, but also Albert Puljolz whose name I will never be able to spell and the Boog who'd learnt about Shu's adoration and come to pledge his true love.)
    
    Anyway, no one cared about the Met, since he'd been one of the players who'd failed to deliver last season, but NCIS insisted on investigating anyway. I'm not sure why, as it certainly isn't their jurisdiction, but give me a break, this is instafic to test the database.
    
    So Gibbs and co. show up and Shu is torn between her hopeless crush and her Gibbs addiction. Meanwhile, Snow is being tormented by Jules via the Lambertfic, a debate has broken out over the best way to make latkes, half of chat has gone to bed and/or just woken up, several people have gone off to write-or-die, and the grue may have got a few Mets (not that anyone noticed).
    
    At which point, the game is called on account of Snow (the precipitation rather than the chatter), and everyone decides that a snowball fight would be more fun anyway.
    
    Sadly the Mets botch this, as they botch everything, and chat emerges victorious and there is hot chocolate and nommy food for all. And shu and boog got married, with snow setting off rockets to send them on their way to wedded bliss.

    It's hard enough to get Dean onto the plane for a half-hour flight, so Sam is profoundly grateful that his brother is too busy pretending not to panic and humming Metallica to notice that the flight they've checked into is to London, England, not London, Ohio.
    
    When the pilot makes his announcements and Dean <em>does</em> realise just how long he's going to be on the plane, Sam only just escapes receiving an injury to a part of his anatomy they'd both <em>really</em> rather stayed in working order. He waves the tickets under Dean's nose desperately.
    
    '...the hell you think you're - Led Zeppelin...?' Dean's brought up short from his rant.
    
    'Exclusive, one-off reunion concert,' Sam says smugly. 'Chance of a lifetime.'
    
    Dean opens and closes his mouth a few times, helplessly.
    
    'I'll still have to kill you for this,' he says finally. His hand settles heavy and warm on Sam's thigh. 'After the show.'
    
    Sam just keeps grinning.
    
    <hr>
    
    Dean doesn't stop grinning the whole way through the show, even when an extremely fat and sweaty guy presses up against him and spills beer down his leather jacket. He's still flying high when the last song's been played and the crowd is spilling out on the street.
    
    'When they played <em>Nobody's Fault</em>, oh dude. I can die happy, now.' Dean's happy glow diminishes for a second when he realises what he's said, because they've had a moratorium on those kind of comments for a while now.
    
    Sam doesn't stop smiling. 'Yeah, about that. You might want to hold off for a while.'
    
    Dean stares at him. 'Sam, if I try to break the deal -'
    
    'If <em>you</em> try to break the deal, yeah.' Sam pulls out a little wooden carving, recognisably Dean except for how it has a big shiny patch smack bang in the middle of its chest. 'You really think I'd bring you all the way to England just to see a bunch of granddads? That guy who spilled his drink on you is the foremost expert in soul magic in the Western hemisphere. He just had to baptise you in the flesh to make the spell stick.'
    
    'Then this...' Dean gestures at the Dean doll. 'You got my soul back?'
    
    Sam just smiles, the kind of smile that says if he tries to say anything he'll end up crying like a girl.
    
    '<em>Dude</em>.'
    
    And maybe Sam could have gone with the crying thing after all, because Dean kisses him right there in the street, big Hollywood smacker, and maybe that even tops seeing Led Zeppelin play live.
