All mailers include Resque::Mailer

This uses the resque_mailer gem to send email asyncronously by default when
using deliver (puts it into a background job)

Jobs are persisted to queues as JSON objects.

The latest version of resque_mailer supports this for active record structures
this is recomended as it gets round the horrible message which is 
create_after and the resque job running before the data is commited.

Additionally if the thing passed is deleted before the email is sent
the data in the email would have been correct.
