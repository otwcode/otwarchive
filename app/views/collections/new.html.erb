  <li>Only registered users can post, so you don't need to worry about spam: you can leave your collection unmoderated. You can always reject works afterwards if there <em>is</em> a mistaken submission.</li>
  <li>The best way to set up a regular challenge (eg, an annual challenge like Yuletide, 
      or a weekly one like sga_flashfic) is to create a closed parent collection and then add a new, open, subcollection for each challenge.
   </li>
   <li>
      If you limit membership for each challenge (eg, for a gift exchange), people can sign
      up for each subcollection separately. If you just want the whole thing moderated, have people sign up as members of the parent collection; they'll then be able to post in every subcollection.
