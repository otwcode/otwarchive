<ul class="notes">
  <li>Keep in mind that only registered users can post anyway, so leaving your
      collection unmoderated will not open you up to spambots or similar issues. 
      Mostly users won't add items to a collection inappropriately, so you don't
      need to add the overhead of approving stories and members unless you really 
      need it. You can always reject stories after the fact.</li>
  <li>If you would like to run a regular challenge (eg, an annual challenge like Yuletide, 
      or a weekly challenge similar to sga_flashfic), the best way to do that is to set 
      up one parent collection, set it to be closed (meaning that people can't
      add stories directly to the parent collection) and then add new subcollections 
      for each challenge.
   </li>
    <li>
      If you limit membership for each challenge (eg, for a gift exchange), you can have people sign
      up for the subcollections separately. If you just want the whole thing moderated,
      you can have people sign up and be members of the parent collection, and then they will 
      be able to post in each subcollection automatically.
