  Hello from the Archive of Our Own!
</h2>

<p>
  A fanfic archive including your works has been backed up to the AO3 by <%= @archivist %>.
  We'd like to make sure you don't mind, and give you a chance to claim those works if you want to.
  And if you don't already have an account, we'd like to invite you aboard!
</p>
  
<p>
  If you're concerned about privacy: these works have been locked to registered users only, 
  so your works will not be publicly readable and will not appear in search engines unless 
  you (or the archivist) unlock them manually. You can also choose to remove your contact 
  information from the stories or delete them entirely.
</p>

<ul>

    <li><%= link_to(work.title.html_safe, work_url(work)) %><%= (work.fandom_string.blank? ? "" : " (#{work.fandom_string})") %></li>
  <% end %>
