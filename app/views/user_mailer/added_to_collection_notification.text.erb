Dear <%= @user.default_pseud.byline %>,

The collection maintainers of <%= @collection.title %> have added your work (<%= @work.title.html_safe %>) to their collection!

You are receiving this notification because you have previously elected to allow automatic inclusion of your works into collections on the Archive of Our Own.

If you would like to remove your work from this collection, please visit your "<%= user_manage_collection_items_page_name(collection_item) %>" page: <%= user_manage_collection_items_url(@user, collection_item) %>.

If in future you would prefer to individually accept or reject requests to add your works to collections, please edit your Preferences (<%= "#{root_url}users/#{@user.default_pseud.name}/preferences" %>) and untick the box next to "Automatically agree to your work being collected by others in the Archive.".

Thanks!
<% end %>
