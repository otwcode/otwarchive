Hello from the Archive of Our Own!
  
You're receiving this e-mail because 852 Prospect (http://852prospect.org/archive/), the Sentinel Adult Fiction Archive, has recently been imported by Open Doors (http://opendoors.transformativeworks.org), into the Archive of Our Own (root_url). Because this e-mail address is connected to one registered on 852 Prospect, the associated 852 Prospect stories have been automatically added to your AO3 account.
  
852 Prospect's software has become somewhat creaky over the years, to the point where all updates are now required by hand. Looking for a more sustainable home for the archive, the archivist alice ttlg has decided to move 852 Prospect to AO3. (You can read the rest of the announcement at http://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/215, and find additional information on Open Doors' FAQ page at http://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/faq. For any questions not answered in the FAQ or this e-mail, please contact Support at <%= root_url %>support.)

If this is a mistake and these are not your stories, please don't delete them! Contact Support and we will whisk them away to wait until someone else comes along to claim them. :)

All of these imported stories are restricted to registered users only (to keep them out of Google searches), so your works will only be readable by logged-in users unless you choose to make them fully visible. By the current archivist's request, all unclaimed imported works will be unrestricted and open to all visitors 3 months after the import, just like the original archive site. For help removing restrictions, orphaning, or deleting your works, please contact Support.

These works were written under the e-mail <%= @external_email %>.

<% @claimed_works.each do |work| %>
* <%= work.title.html_safe %>: <%= work_url(work) %>
<% end %>


To preserve rec lists and bookmarks, the imported archive's web addresses will redirect to the imported copy of these works.  If you've already uploaded a copy of these stories and you did NOT use the import from URL feature, once the archive import happens there will be two copies of the same story on the archive. Please don't delete the newly imported copies as it will break the redirect--instead, please claim the the stories and request that Open Doors reset the redirect to point toward the pre-existing copy on AO3 by contacting Open Doors at http://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/contact/open%20doors with your AO3 account name, your account name on the imported archive, and links to both the original archive URL, and the URL of the fanwork designated as the redirect.

If you have other stories on the imported archive under an e-mail address you can no longer access, please contact Open Doors (http://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/contact) with any information that can help verify your identity.

For other inquiries, please contact Support.

Many thanks!
