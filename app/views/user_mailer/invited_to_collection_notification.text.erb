Dear <%= @user.default_pseud.byline %>,

The collection maintainers of <%= @collection.title %> would like to include your work (<%= @work.title.html_safe %>) in their collection!

To approve or reject this request, please visit your "Collection Items" page: <%= user_collection_items_url(@user) %>.

If in future you would prefer to automatically approve requests to add your
works to collections, please edit your Preferences (<%= "#{root_url}users/#{@user.default_pseud.name}/preferences" %>)
and tick the box next to "Automatically agree to your work being collected by others in the Archive.".

Thanks!
<% end %>
