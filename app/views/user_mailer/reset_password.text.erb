<%= @user.login %>, the following generated password has been created for you: <%= @password %>

After you log in using this generated password you will be asked to change your password to something you can remember. If you do not use this generated password within a week, it will expire, and you will have to request a new one.

If you did not request this password reset, you may ignore this email and your previous password will continue to work.
