  <p>Dear <%= style_bold(@user.default_pseud.byline) %>,</p>

  <p>The collection maintainers of <%= style_link(@collection.title, collection_url(@collection)) %> have
    added your work (<%= style_link(@work.title.html_safe, work_url(@work)) %>) to their collection!</p>

  <p>You are receiving this notification because you have previously elected to allow
  automatic inclusion of your works into collections on the Archive of Our Own.</p>

  <p>If you would like to remove your work from this collection, please visit your
   <%= style_link("Approved Collection Items page", user_collection_items_url(@user) + "?approved=true") %>.</p>

  <p>If in future you would prefer to individually accept or reject requests to add your
    works to collections, please edit your <%= style_link("Preferences", "#{root_url}users/#{@user.default_pseud.name}/preferences") %>
    and untick the box next to: <%= style_quote("\"Automatically agree to your work being collected by others in the Archive.\"") %>
  </p>

  <p>Thanks!</p>
<% end %>
