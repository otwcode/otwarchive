  We would like to invite you to join our beta test and create an account! If you do, the stories will automatically be added
  to your account as soon as you have done so, and you will have full control over them.
  If you already <strong>have</strong> an archive account, just log in and reload this page, and we'll assign you the stories. Otherwise,
  please choose from the following!

  If you don't want to claim these stories on the archive, you can either orphan them (leave them in the archive with your contact information
  and optionally your name removed), or delete them. You can also tell us not to email you in future and/or not to import stories with this email 
  address in future.
