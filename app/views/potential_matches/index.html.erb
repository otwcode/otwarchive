    Your challenge doesn't currently have any match settings defined. To set them up, please
    go to Challenge Settings and enter them in the <strong>Minimum Number To Match</strong> section. 
    You will then be able to use the archive matching tools to help you create 
    and send out assignments for all your challenge participants, after signup is over.

  <h3>No Potential Recipients</h3>
  <p class="note">
    <strong>Warning!</strong> These participants have no potential <strong>recipients</strong>: no one else
    signed up for the challenge has requested anything that matches what they have offered. 
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    Every participant needs at least one potential recipient, so you will need to either
    edit your match settings or edit their signups (or delete them). 
    Then regenerate potential matches to continue.
