  <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) establishes the procedure the Organization for Transformative Works

  <h3 class="heading" id="removal_options">My work was posted on AO3 without my permission. What can I do?</h3>
  <p>If you encounter content on AO3 that you believe infringes on your copyright, you have the following options:
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="/abuse_reports/new">Submit an Abuse report</a>:</strong> Abuse reports are evaluated by the
        Policy & Abuse committee for violations of the <a href="/tos">AO3 Terms of Service</a>, and held to a very
        high <a href="/tos_faq#report_anonymity">standard of confidentiality</a>. When submitting an Abuse report
        about copyright infringement, you must provide a link to the violating content on AO3 and clearly identify
        the original source in your report description. For more information, please refer to the <a
        href="/tos_faq#report_infringement">Terms of Service FAQ</a>.</li>
      <li><strong><a href="#takedown_instructions">File a DMCA takedown notice</a>:</strong> DMCA takedown notices can
        only be filed by the copyright owner or someone legally authorized to act on their behalf. DMCA notices must
        be sent to the OTW's designated agent and comply with all <a href="#takedown_requirements">legal
          requirements</a>. DMCA notices are not subject to confidentiality. The OTW reserves the right to make
        public all DMCA notices that we receive, though some information may be redacted for privacy.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Please <strong>do not</strong> submit an Abuse report if you intend to file a DMCA notice. Submitting both an
    Abuse report and a DMCA notice about the same content may delay the processing of both requests.</p>
  <h4 class="heading" id="takedown_instructions">Filing a DMCA takedown notice</h4>
  <p>To initiate a formal DMCA takedown request, contact the OTW's designated agent using <a
      href="https://www.transformativeworks.org/contact_us/?who=Legal%20Advocacy">the Legal committee's contact
      form</a>, via email to legal@transformativeworks.org, or by mailing a letter to:</p>

  <p>We prefer to receive DMCA requests through the contact form or by email.</p>
  <h4 class="heading" id="takedown_requirements">Requirements of a DMCA takedown notice</h4>
  <p>The takedown notice must substantially comply with the requirements of 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(c)(3)(A). You are also
    required to consent to the jurisdiction of a United States court. The legal requirements of a valid DMCA
    takedown notice include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
    <li>your contact information;</li>
    <li>identification of the copyrighted work being infringed upon (for example, a URL or publication listing);
    </li>
    <li>the URL(s) of the specific content on our site that you believe to be infringing;</li>
    <li>a statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the content is not authorized by the copyright
      owner(s), their agent, or the law;</li>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>a statement, <strong>made under penalty of perjury</strong>, that you are authorized to act on
          behalf of the copyright owner; and</li>
        <li>a statement that the information you have provided is accurate.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Per 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(f), you may be subject to liability if you knowingly and materially misrepresent your claim
    that the content infringes on your copyright.</p>
  <h4 class="heading" id="takedown_process">DMCA takedown process</h4>
  <p>If the OTW receives a DMCA takedown notice that fulfills all <a href="#takedown_requirements">legal
      requirements</a>, we will remove the content once we review the validity of the infringement claim.</p>
  <p>When the content is removed from AO3, the information you provided in the DMCA takedown notice will be forwarded
    to the owner of the account responsible for posting the content. We may also send a redacted version of the DMCA
    takedown notice to <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/">Lumen</a> and other third parties at our discretion.</p>
  <p>If the account owner believes that their content does not infringe upon your copyright, they may file a DMCA
    counternotice disputing the takedown. The account owner can file a DMCA counternotice at any point after the
    content has been removed; there is no time limit.</p>
  <p>If the OTW receives a valid DMCA counternotice, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you. You will have 10
    business days to file a lawsuit to prevent the restoration of the content. If you do not notify us within 10
    business days that you have filed a lawsuit, we will allow the content to be restored in accordance with 17
    U.S.C. ยง 512(g)(2)(B)-(C).</p>
  <h3 class="heading" id="appeal_options">I was notified that my work was removed from AO3 due to a DMCA takedown
    notice. What can I do?</h3>
  <p><a href="/content#II.D">Copyright infringement</a> and <a href="/content#II.E">plagiarism</a> are violations of
    Sections II.D and II.E of our <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>, respectively. For more information, please
    refer to our <a href="/tos_faq#copyright_plagiarism_faq">Terms of Service FAQ</a>.</p>
  <p>If the OTW receives a valid DMCA takedown notice for content you uploaded to AO3, we will <a
      href="/tos_faq#complaint_notification">remove the content and notify you by email</a>. We may also send a
    redacted version of the DMCA takedown notice to <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/">Lumen</a> and other third
    parties at our discretion.</p>
  <p>If your content was removed due to a DMCA takedown notice, <strong>you <em>cannot</em> reupload or repost the
      content unless you have filed a DMCA counternotice to dispute the takedown</strong>. If you reupload or
    repost the content without filing a DMCA counternotice, we may <a href="#repeat_offenses">suspend your
      account</a>.</p>
  <h4 class="heading" id="counternotice_instructions">Filing a DMCA counternotice</h4>
  <p>If you believe that your content does not infringe on the copyright owner's rights, you can file a DMCA
    counternotice to dispute the takedown. By filing a counternotice, you are indicating that <strong>you are
      willing to defend your use of the original copyrighted material in court</strong> if the party who submitted
    the original takedown notice chooses to pursue legal action against you.</p>
  <p>If you are considering whether to file a DMCA counternotice, we recommend that you contact an intellectual
    property lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction, so that you are aware of your legal rights and
    obligations. You can also review the <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/topics/14">Lumen DMCA Explanation and
      FAQ</a>.</p>

      <li>a statement that you will accept service of process from the party who submitted the original takedown

    <h3 class="heading" id="repeat_offenses">Repeat offenses</h3>
    <p>As required by 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(i)(1)(A), we may <a href="/tos_faq#penalty">suspend</a> users who repeatedly
      violate others' copyright. The OTW has the discretion to decide what qualifies as a repeated offense.</p>
