<h4>Troubleshooting Importing</h4>

<p>If your text gets truncated at the point of an em dash or accented character, you might have to manually set the encoding.</p>

<p>If you are importing a chaptered work from fanfiction.net or any efiction archive (that is, an archive that uses "viewstory.php" in the URL), 
  you only need to enter the URL of the first chapter and the entire work will be downloaded with the chapters preserved. (As a result, you cannot turn multiple fanfiction.net or efiction works 
  into the chapters of a single work.)</p>

<p>Unless you check the override box, any information you enter under Work Tags will only be used if the importer cannot determine tags from the work itself.</p>

<p>You will be able to edit and complete the standard header information after the import has been completed.</p>
