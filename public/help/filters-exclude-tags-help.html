<h2 class="heading">Tag Filters</h2>

<p>The filters list the ten most popular tags for each tag category. To filter by any other tags, you need to use the "Other tags to exclude" field.</p>

<p>If the tag you want to exclude isn't in the top ten, start entering the tag you need in the "Other tags to exclude" field&mdash;all types of tags are valid here, and you can add as many tags as you want. The autocomplete will help you find the <em>canonical</em> version of the tag. Use these to take full advantage of the wrangled tagging structure, and exclude all works tagged with tags with synonymous meanings and subtags.</p>

<p>You can enter tags that aren't in the autocomplete, but in that case the filters will do a simple text match and may bring up unexpected results. The "Search within results" field will text-match more accurately, especially in the case of relationship tags and other tags with "/" or other non-text characters.</p>

<p>Choosing any tag from a category or entering a tag in the "Other tags to exclude" field will do an AND search with all the tags you select. This means that if you're filtering the <a href="/tags/F*s*F/works">works tagged with the F/F category</a>, select the <samp>Major Character Death</samp> warning, the canonical <samp>Alternate Universe</samp> tag in the Additional Tags category, and enter or select the canonical tag <samp>Drama</samp> in the "Other tags to exclude" field, only <a href="/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search[sort_column]=revised_at&work_search[rating_ids][]=11&work_search[freeform_ids][]=60&work_search[other_tag_names]=Drama&work_search[query]=&work_search[language_id]=&work_search[complete]=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=F%2FF">works tagged without <em>any</em> of these tags</a> will be included in the results.</p>

<p>To look up tags and see which ones are canonical, use the <a href="/tags/search">Tag Search</a>.</p>
