    When this option is enabled, the email address associated with your account will be publicly visible on your user profile page.

  <dd>
    When this option is enabled, the date of birth associated with your account will be publicly visible on your user profile page.

  <dt>Hide my work from search engines when possible</dt>
  <dd>
    Enabling this option will tell search engines not to index your user page or your works. Please note that not all search engines respect this setting. Pages which list your work - for example, the main works page - may also still be indexed. If you wish to avoid your works being indexed under any circumstances, we recommend that you restrict them to Archive users only.
  </dd>
  <dt>Hide the share buttons on my work</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This preference allows you to disable the one-click share buttons which allow others to recommend your work 
      on external sites like Twitter and Tumblr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that once you have posted a work online, it is always possible for a reader to copy and paste a link to your work
      anywhere they wish -- if you want to restrict access to your work here, your best bet is to lock the work to registered users of 
      the Archive.
