<h5>Tag Options: Characters and Relationships</h5>

<p>
  Very often, you will want your users to choose only from the characters or relationships that belong to the fandom they've chosen to sign up for. Unfortunately, the Archive can't figure out on its own that, for instance, the character "Zaphod Beeblebrox" is associated with the fandom "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy". These options are intended to help you get the results you want.

  <dt>Option 1: Nothing!</dt>
  <dd>
    By default both checkmarks here will be unchecked, meaning that your participants will be presented with autocomplete listings that allow them to choose from the canonical versions of character and relationship tags. This is a quick and dirty way to ensure most of your participants will sign up for the same versions of the characters or relationships and be matchable, even if you have so many characters or relationships that you don't want to create a tag set. This option doesn't restrict by fandom and lets users choose from any canonical character and relationship tags on the Archive. Users will have to know at least a part of the tag to trigger autocomplete results.

  <dt>Option 2: Fandom Only</dt>
  <dd>
    If you check this option, participants will only be allowed to sign up for a character or relationship that matches the fandom they have chosen in their prompt. The list of characters or relationships will be a combination of the tags that have been officially linked with that fandom (or "wrangled")", as well as any tag associations you may have set up for that fandom in your tag set(s).
  </dd>
  <dt>Option 3: By Tag Set Fandom Only</dt>
  <dd>
    If you don't want all the wrangled characters available, then check this option, and <strong>only</strong> the characters you've associated in your tag set will be allowed.
