<h4>Initialize Tag List</h4>

<p>
  This option allows you to ask the Archive to give you a block of tags to start from, based on their popularity (for instance
  if you wanted to run a rare-fandoms challenge, or a challenge just for popular pairings).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want tags that are more rare, choose "below the average"</li>
  <li>If you want tags that are more popular, choose "above the average"</li>
  <li>
    If you want to tweak the list, you can multiply the average to change the results. The result will be different
    depending on whether you are getting more or less popular tags. 
    <ul>
      <li>If you are getting rare tags, increasing the average will give you more tags.</li>
      <li>If you are getting rare tags, decreasing the average (ie, multiplying it by a fraction) will give you fewer tags.</li>
      <li>If you are getting popular tags, increasing the average will give you fewer tags.</li>
      <li>If you are getting popular tags, decreasing the average will give you more tags.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Examples:</h5>

<p>
  Case 1: I want to run a super-obscure-fandoms challenge where only those fandoms that have barely any stories at all
  should qualify. I choose <tt>below the average</tt> and I multiply the average by <tt>0.1</tt> to cut down the list. (Note: it will still be pretty
  big since all fandoms that have zero stories will qualify!) 
</p>

<p>
  Case 2: I want to run a pan-fandom gift exchange challenge, but I want to make everyone include at least one really big, safe fandom that will match 
  easily. I choose <tt>above the average</tt> and I multiply the average by <tt>20</tt>. (I would then require people to choose at least one
  fandom from this set, and have them put their harder fandom requests in the "Optional" tags section.)
