<h4>Adding To Collections</h4>

<p>
  Enter collection names as a comma-separated list, and the item you are editing will be added to all the collections you specify.
</p> 

<p>
  Note that you need to use the collection name that is in the collection's URL (for example, in http://archiveofourown.org/collections/an_example_collection, the collection name is "an_example_collection"), because different collections can have the same display title; only the name in its URL is unique. Names will be auto-completed for you if you have JavaScript turned on.
</p>

<p>
  Also note: if the collection you are submitting to is moderated, and you aren't a member, your work will not be added to the collection automatically&mdash;it will have to be approved by one of the collection's moderators. If this is an anonymous and/or unrevealed collection, your work will become anonymous and/or hidden as soon as you associate it with the collection, including while it's waiting for approval.
</p>

<p>
  If you change your mind about having an item in a collection, you can either edit the list of collections when editing the work, or you can manage all your collected items on the My Collections page in your account, under "Manage Collected Works".
