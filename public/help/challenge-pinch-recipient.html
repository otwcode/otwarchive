<h4>Pinch Recipients</h4>

<p>
  A "pinch recipient" is someone who is assigned to <strong>get</strong> an extra gift, just like
  pinch hitters are assigned to <strong>give</strong> an extra gift. 
</p> 

<p>
  The reason you would assign a pinch recipient is that sometimes in a gift exchange, it may not be possible to get everyone 
  assigned one on one. Instead of shuffling to try and match everybody, you can instead recruit a few pinch hitters for the 
  people who don't have an assigned writer, and assign "pinch recipients" for the people who don't have a request of their own. 
</p>

<p>
  Pinch recipients must be people signed up for the challenge. As far as the person getting the assignment is concerned, 
  they will not see a difference between a pinch recipient and a regular recipient. The recipient will just have two 
  givers, and assuming neither one defaults, will get two gifts instead of one.
