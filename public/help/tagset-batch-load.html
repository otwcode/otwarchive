<h4>Batch Loading</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You can only batch load tag associations if the tags already exist, to avoid mass-adding piles of wrong tags to the archive. :)</li>
  <li>If you really want to add some new tags to the archive, you can add them to your tag set first, and then batch-load the associations here afterwards.</li>
  <li>If two tags are already associated in the archive or in your tag set, it won't associate them again!</li>
  <li>Only the associations that didn't work will remain in the form.</li>
  <li>If the batch load is taking too long and you're getting 502s, please split up the amount you're trying to load!</li>
</ul>
