<h4>Adding To Collections</h4>

<p>
  Enter collection names as a comma-separated list, and your work will be added to all the collections you specify.
</p> 
  
<p>
  Note that you need to use the collection's name, which gets used in the collection's URL, and not the collection's spiffy title 
  (because different collections can have the same title). A collection's name is the equivalent of your user login.
  Names will be auto-completed for you if you have JavaScript turned on.
</p>
  
<p>
  Also note: if the collection you are submitting to is moderated, and you aren't a member, your story will not be 
  added to the collection automatically &#8212; it will have to be approved by one of the collection's moderators. 
  If this is a secret/anonymous collection, you might want to make sure you are a member <strong>before</strong> you post,
  as otherwise your story will not be hidden/anonymous until it is approved. (You can join a collection on its
  home page.)
</p>

<p>
  If you change your mind about having your work in a collection, you can either edit the list of collections
  when editing the work, or you can manage all your collected works under the "My Collections" page in your account.
