<h4>Relationships Tags</h4>

<p>(For more information, see the <a href="/faq/tags">Tags on the Archive FAQ</a>.)</p>

<p>
    The relationships in your work. Full names are preferred (for example, "Mickey Mouse/Minnie Mouse" or
    "Rodney McKay & John Sheppard") when possible. You may list more than one relationship, separated by commas.
    Please note that all user-created tags must be 150 characters or less; if your work contains a large poly
    relationship or multiple characters with long names, you may want to consider shortening these names to just first
    names or surnames with initials to avoid going over the character limit while keeping the names recognizable.
