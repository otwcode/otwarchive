<h3>Skin Parents</h3>

<p>
  You can combine multiple skins by making one the parent of another. Parent skins are loaded in order. 
</p>

<p>
  By default, skins will be loaded after the archive default style. If you don't want this, you can specify
  that you want your skin to replace rather than add to the archive default style. 
</p>

<h4>Load Archive Skin Components</h4>

<p>
  If you create a replacement skin, you might want to load up all the skins that make up the current default
  archive site as parents, and you can then edit your skin and delete out just the ones you don't want. 
  This will be easier if you are using nearly all of them, since there are a lot!
