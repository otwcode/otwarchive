<h3>Skin Parents</h3>

<p>
  You can combine multiple skins by making one the parent of another. Parent skins are loaded in order.

<p>
  By default, skins will be loaded after the archive default style. If you don't want this, make 
  your skin a "Site" skin and ONLY your parent skins will be loaded.
