<h4>Tag Selection</h4>

<h5>Tag Options</h5>

<p>
  If you put specific tags into the tag options fields, people will have to choose from only these tags using
  tickyboxes when they sign up. This is useful when, for instance, you want to make people choose one out of five fandoms. 
</p>

<p>
  Note: if you are running a challenge that is specifically for one given fandom or relationship or character, 
  you do <strong>NOT</strong> need to use this -- just set that kind of tag to 0 tags required/allowed above. 
  Tag options should only be used where you want users to have a choice.
</p>

<p>
  You do NOT have to specify tags for every kind of tag you have allowed. For instance, you can put in five specific fandoms,
  and also allow one character tag without putting in tag options. 
  Then the person signing up will have to choose one of the five fandoms, but can just
  type in a character tag.
</p>

<h5>Initializing the tag list</h5>
<p>
  Initializing the tag list will give you a starting point if you want to restrict your challenge to
  especially popular or especially rare fandoms or characters. The way this works is, we calculate the average number
  of stories in fandoms, and then compare. You can tweak the results by multiplying the average -- eg, if you only want the
  truly super-rare, drop the average way down. Keep in mind that the average is low to begin with!
