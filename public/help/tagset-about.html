<h4>About Tag Sets</h4>

<p>
  If you've ever wanted to run a challenge on the Archive, that's what tag sets are for. 
  You set up a tag set to hold a list of all the tags that should be available for sign-up, 
  (even if those tags haven't been used on the Archive before now), and then add the tag set
  to your challenge. Tags in the tag set will then automatically show up in the sign-up form.
</p> 

<p>
  You can bring on as many moderators as you want to help you manage your tag set, and they do not 
  need to have access to the challenge settings. 
  You can also allow the participants in your challenge to nominate tags to be added to your set,
  review those nominations and approve or reject them, and even submit requests to the Archive's
  tag wranglers if (for instance) you need a new fandom added or a new character to be assigned to a
  particular fandom. 
</p>  

<p>
  On the main index, you'll find a random selection of tag sets in the Archive that other users have made.  
  You can browse these to get more of an idea how tag sets work.
</p>

<p>
  Some owners may choose to make their tag set publicly available for others to use in their challenges,
  and the Archive admins may also make some publicly available tag sets.  
  Please note that the owners of a tag set <strong>can delete the tag set or change it without warning</strong>, 
  so before you use someone else's tag set for your challenge, please be sure that you trust them not to change it,
  say, in the middle of your signups. :)
