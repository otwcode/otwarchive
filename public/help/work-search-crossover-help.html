<h4>Work Search: Crossovers</h4>

<p>Generally speaking, a <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Crossover">crossover</a> is a work with more than one fandom. However, a lot of fandoms on AO3 are closely related: a movie and its sequel, or two series of TV shows or books set in the same universe, sharing many of the same characters. As we introduce crossover filtering, we've opted to err on the side of trying to return the best results we can, so we're considering a work to be a crossover if it's tagged with one or more <em>unrelated</em> fandoms, and we're using our tag wrangling system to make that determination.</p>

<p>Looking for crossovers between two specific fandoms? Enter their names in the 'Fandoms' field on the search form or select both fandoms from the filters.</p>
