<h4>Public Skins</h4>

<dl id="help">
  <dt>You can share your skins</dt>
  <dd>
    Once you are happy with your skin, if you feel it would be generally useful, you can tick the box to mark it as public. Please note that you are required to upload a preview of how the skin will look if you want to submit it for public use.
    It will be reviewed by archive administrators to make sure it works well and will be useful before it is approved (or not). 
    Please note that if your skin is approved for public use, you will no longer be able to edit or delete it! (Since other people may be using it at that point.) 
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Not all skins will be approved</dt>
  <dd>
    We want to keep the set of public skins easy to browse, and all public skins must be approved by a senior coder, so approval may take a while (especially at the beginning), or not happen if we feel it isn't different enough from existing skins, or broadly useful. This may have nothing to do with how awesome your skin is! 
    You can still use the skin yourself, however, or share it elsewhere for other users to copy and paste for themselves. 
  </dd>
  
  <dt>External images</dt>
  <dd>
    We've changed our policy on this now! Public skins CAN contain images now, but so we can make sure that the image links will not break, we will download the images to our own servers. Please only share your skin if you are okay with our doing this! We do also ask that if possible you
    attribute your images with comments in the css, like this: 
    <blockquote><pre>
      /* this image is from Twin Peaks */
    </pre></blockquote>
  </dd>
    
  <dt>Public skins may be edited by administrators</dt>
  <dd>
    We reserve the right to edit public skins in future (we may have to in order to keep them working if for instance we change the underlying HTML). Once you have made your skin public, please be aware that it is part of the archive code and may be changed, and please do not apply to make your skins public if you aren't okay with that. 
  </dd>
