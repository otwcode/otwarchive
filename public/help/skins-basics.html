  A site skin lets you change the way the Archive looks in your browser, so you can customize your reading experience.
  Don't like the Archive fonts? You can change them! Don't like the red header? Swap it out for blue! 
  When you make a site skin, keep in mind that you are only changing the Archive appearance for yourself -- other Archive users
  will see the Archive in whatever skin they are using. In other words, site skins are useful for creating your own ideal
  reading experience, not for changing the way a work appears for other readers.

  A work skin lets you change the way one or more of your stories appears to other readers. Work skins will ONLY affect 
  the body of the story -- that is, you can't change what the Archive navigation or background look like for someone else.
  What you can do, however, is create your own classes. For instance, you can change the color of some of your text, 
  or indent some paragraphs in a particular way, and so on.

  If you create a great skin that you would like to make available for others to use, you can choose to share
  it by applying to have it approved by Archive admins and made public, but this is completely optional.
