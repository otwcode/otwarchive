<h4>Defaulted Assignments</h4>

<p>
  If a user defaults on a challenge assignment or you mark them as having defaulted, their assignment will appear in this section. 
  The assignment will show whether the recipient was a pinch recipient (<a href="/help/challenge-pinch-recipient.html">Huh? What's a pinch recipient?</a>) 
  or herself defaulted (in which case you may not want to bother assigning a pinch hitter).
</p>

<p>
  You can assign a pinch hitter by writing in their Archive pseud (an autocomplete will help you if you have JavaScript enabled)
  and pressing <tt>Assign</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
  You can also manually mark an assignment as <tt>Covered</tt> if you have manually assigned a pinch hitter some other way, or
  if you are not going to assign one (e.g., because the recipient defaulted, or if the assignment was a pinch recipient assignment
  anyway).
</p>

<p>
  Note: the same recipient might show up more than once in the defaulted assignments table, for instance if they were a pinch
  recipient, or if a pinch hitter assigned to them also defaulted. You can assign a pinch hitter to whichever of these defaulted 
  assignments you want, and then mark the others as covered.
</p>

<p>
  By default, only assignments that don't have a pinch hitter and haven't been manually marked as covered will show up in the list.
  If you want to see all the assigned and covered pinch hits, you can choose <tt>Show Assigned Pinch Hits</tt> to see them all.
