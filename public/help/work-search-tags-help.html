<h4>Work Search Tags</h4>

<p>Searches all tags associated with a work. Category, Warnings, Rating, Fandom, Characters, Relationships, and Additional Tags are all treated as tags. Consequently, all of these terms are acceptable in this field:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>For Category:</dt>
  <dd>F/F, F/M, M/M, Gen, Multi, Other</dd>
  <dt>For Warnings:</dt>
  <dd>"Graphic Depictions Of Violence", "Major Character Death", "Rape/Non-Con", Underage, "No Archive Warnings Apply", "Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings"</dd>
  <dt>For Rating:</dt>
  <dd>"General Audiences", Teen, Mature, Explicit, "Not Rated"</dd>
</dl>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<dl>
  <dt><kbd>"Fandom X" F/F -Explicit</kbd></dt>
  <dd>will return all works from Fandom X tagged as F/F, and exclude those tagged Explicit</dd>
	<dt><kbd>"Character A" OR "Character B" -"Character Death"</kbd></dt>
  <dd>will return all works including Character A or Character B (or both), and no works tagged with "Character Death" in either the Warnings or the Additional tags</dd>
  <dt><kbd>"Character A/Character B" Underage Mature OR Explicit</kbd></dt>
  <dd>will return all works for this pairing that include an Underage warning and are either rated Mature or Explicit</dd>
</dl>

<p>Search terms are not case-sensitive. "Multiple words in a term" or "terms including a hyphen-or-dash" need to be enclosed in quotes. Note that a search for a "First Name/First Name" relationship tag will not bring up works tagged with the more accepted "First Name Last Name/First Name Last Name" variant. Try to use the canonical version of a tag where possible.</p>
