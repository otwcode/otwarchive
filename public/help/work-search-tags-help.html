<h4>Work Search: Tags</h4>

<p>The fields for Fandoms, Characters, Relationships, and Additional Tags suggest tags as you type. Try to use the "canonical" or common version of a tag if the autocomplete offers one. It will return all results containing this tag and synonyms of this tag. For example, picking the common relationship tag <samp>Erika Mustermann/Juan P&eacute;rez</samp> will return works tagged <samp>Juan P&eacute;rez/Erika Mustermann</samp> as well, assuming these tags have been linked by a wrangler in the background.</p>

<p>If a tag doesn't appear in the autocomplete menu, it doesn't necessarily mean that the tag doesn't exist on the Archive, just that it hasn't been marked as common by a tag wrangler. You can type in any word or phrase here, without surrounding quote marks. If your phrase doesn't exactly match a common tag, it will find all tags containing the words in your phrase. Typing in <kbd>People Doing Things</kbd> will also find works tagged <samp>Nice People Doing Things</samp>, <samp>People Doing Shady Things</samp>, and <samp>People Doing Things with Spoons</samp>. Depending on your search, results in this case will be somewhat unpredictable.</p>

<p>The more search terms you enter or options you pick, the more your search results will be narrowed down: Entering two fandoms will only find crossovers of those fandoms, not all works that are in one fandom <em>or</em> the other. Entering two characters will only find works that have both. Picking <samp>M/M</samp> and <samp>F/M</samp> will only include a work in the search results if it has both category tags.</p>
