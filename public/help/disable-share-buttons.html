<h2>Hide the share buttons on my work</h2>

  This preference allows you to disable the one-click share buttons which allow others to recommend your work 
  on external sites like Twitter and Tumblr.

  Please note that once you have posted a work online, it is always possible for a reader to copy and paste a link to your work
  anywhere they wish -- if you want to restrict access to your work here, your best bet is to lock the work to registered users of 
  the Archive.
