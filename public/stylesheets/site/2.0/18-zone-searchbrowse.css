/*==ZONE: SEARCH/BROWSE (currently header linked index pages)
The search and browse zone is in development and has no parent class yet
Arguably filter and search could be styled here but are currently in interactions
.search and .browse may turn out to be separate but interrelated /*

/* INDEX PAGES (with filters)*/ 
.works-index .index, .collections-index .index 
        { width:75%; float:left}

/* COLLECTIONS SHOW*/
.collections-show h2 span 
        { font-size: smaller }

/* BOOKMARKS INDEX
test note: this is probably obsolete*/
.bookmarks-index .user .module
        { float: none; }
