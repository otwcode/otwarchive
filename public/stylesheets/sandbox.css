/*==SANDBOX: All temporary, development, and unreviewed css lives here.
Rules will be incorporated into the main cascade by Front End before deploy.
If you've just coded up a new feature and put in some layout, put that layout here,
with a comment, and the Front End Santa will make your wishes come true.
Or if you've put in a fix and you've not yet read the Front End Docs?
Put your fix in here.
Examples:

/*Fix for issue 996
.bookmark .header {float:left;}

/*Draft layout for views/shiny/new by astolat.
It has to be purple, see wiki, ADT meeting 25
.shiny-happy-people table {display:table-cell;
background:purple; color:#555;}

/*Some helpful notes
0.875em/1.286 line height = 14px with 18px leading
0.643em  = 9px, so {margin: 0.643em auto;} gives you a single blank line between block elements */

/* styling for AO3-3359 to remove top padding from the new button
and preserve the balance/symmetry of the page */
#new_work_search fieldset:first-of-type .submit {
  padding-top: 0;
}

/* Issue 3243 needs nested ul to be indented in external_authors/claim
*/
.edit_external_author ul ul {
  margin-left: 2.75em;
}

/* AO3-5845: Workaround for Twitter button not always displaying in some
browsers. */
.twitter-share-button {
  min-width: 76px;
  min-height: 28px;
  width: 76px;
  height: 28px;
}
