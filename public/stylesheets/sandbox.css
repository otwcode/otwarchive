/*==SANDBOX: All temporary, development, and unreviewed css lives here. 
Rules will be incorporated into the main cascade by Front End before deploy. 
If you've just coded up a new feature and put in some layout, put that layout here, 
with a comment, and the Front End Santa will make your wishes come true. 
Or if you've put in a fix and you've not yet read the Front End Docs? 
Put your fix in here.
Examples:

/*Fix for issue 996 
.bookmark .header {float:left;}

/*Draft layout for views/shiny/new by astolat. 
It has to be purple, see wiki, ADT meeting 25
.shiny-happy-people table {display:table-cell; 
background:purple; color:#555;}

*/

/*OPERA 11 HEADER SEARCH TEMP FIX*/
@media not screen and (1) {
        #header fieldset {margin-bottom:-0.643em} 
}


/*DEVELOPMENT ONLY. DO NOT DEPLOY */
#debug {display:none;}

/*LISTBOX in dev
expand collapse with growing boxes NEEDS JAVASCRIPT as onhover is not desirable
drafting adding class "expanded" onclick? 
Is this a variant of show many show more or shall i put it in roles/states
note: this does not reflow content, is reflow desirable?*/

li.collapsed { height:2em; min-height:0; 
-webkit-transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
  -moz-transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
  -o-transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
  -ms-transition: all 1s ease-in-out;}
li.expanded{ width:100%;height:auto;position:absolute;z-index:500;
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.02);
  -moz-transform: scale(1.02);
  -o-transform: scale(1.02);
  -ms-transform: scale(1.02);
   box-shadow:1px 1px 3px #555;}


/* INTERACTIONS MODE: VERBOSE
forms with more than three fieldsets 
(01/09/11 all forms show nearly all options at the moment, some nested fieldsets hidden with .hideme
but I suggest simple and verbose views, with simple as default and verbose as child of simple, especially for .post (work, bookmark, challenge etc)*/
.verbose legend { height:auto; width:auto; font-size:100%; background:#f4effc;border:2px solid #ddd; padding:0.5em; box-shadow:1px 2px 3px #999; opacity:1}
/* MODE: SIMPLE, 3 or fewer
experimental, developing here, (may combine with .toggled rules)
drafting: form.simple {background:#ddd; float:none; display:table; margin:0.643em auto; padding:0.643em}*/
.simple span.actions { float:none;}



/*Some helpful notes
0.875em/1.286 line height = 14px with 18px leading
0.643em  = 9px, so {margin: 0.643em auto;} gives you a single blank line between block elements */
