# BACKGROUND:
# To describe the idea here -- these are capistrano "recipes" which are a bit like rake tasks
# You wrap all the fiddly systems scripts and things that you need to do for a deploy into these nice neat little individual tasks
# and then you can chain the tasks together
# 
# when you run "cap deploy:migrate" let's say, all the things you've told to run before or after it go automatically
# eg this line in deploy/production.rb:
#    before "deploy:migrate", "production_only:backup_db"
# says, if I run "cap deploy:migrate production" then before doing any of the actual work of the deploy, 
# run the task called "production_only:backup_db" which is defined in deploy.rb as:
#
# namespace :production_only do
#   # Back up the production database
#   task :backup_db, :roles => [:db] do
#     run "/static/bin/backup_database.sh &"
#   end
# end
#
# which says, run this script backup_database.sh
# and run it on the machine that has the ":db" role
# 
# The roles are defined in each of deploy/production.rb and deploy/staging.rb, 
# and can be set differently for whichever system you are deploying to:
# 
# so for example in production.rb:
# # otw3 and otw4 are the main web/app combos
# server "otw3.ao3.org", :web, :app
# server "otw4.ao3.org", :web, :app
# 
# # otw5 is the db server
# server "otw5.ao3.org", :db
# 
# 
# while in staging.rb it is pretty simple, it's all one machine:
# server "stage.ao3.org", :search, :backend, :web, :app, :db, :primary => true
#
