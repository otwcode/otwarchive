        description: "Recalculate the filters for this work based on the current set of tags. Use this option if wrangling seems to have gone wrong. (e.g. If you synned one of this work's tags to a canonical but it's not showing up in the tag listings, or if the wrong tags are listed in the sidebar when you drill down to a search that includes only this work.)"

(e.g. If the tag works list is missing works tagged with a synonym, or if the tags listed in the sidebar are extremely wrong. Keep in mind that the tags listed in the sidebar will never be 100% correct, but if there's a non-canonical tag listed, or if the count is off by an order of magnitude, you should probably use this option.)"
