Use this option if the filters include old canonical tags that have been renamed or old parent tags that works aren't tagged with, or if the tag counts are wildly off. Also use this option if the works from a synonym are not showing on the works page of the canonical within a half hour of the tag being synned. Keep in mind that the tags listed in the filters will never be 100% correct."

        description: "Try to delete invalid associations involving this tag (e.g., parents of the wrong type, children of the wrong type, duplicate parents/children/metatags/subtags, etc.). Most of these impossible relationships appear on tag landing pages."
      fix_meta_tags:
        title: "Fix Metatags"
        description: "Try to recalculate inherited metatags. Use this option if this tag has grandparent metatags (i.e., a metatag with its own metatag), and the works aren't showing up in the grandparent's listing. You might also try this if you've removed a metatag, but the works are still showing up in the former metatag's listing. If the works still don't go away, ask a staffer to run \"Update Tag Filters\" on this tag."
