      harassment:
        advocating_harm:
          heading: Advocating Harm
          text: Content that advocates specific, real, harmful actions towards real people is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, directing death threats or slurs at people outside of fiction, as well as encouraging others to harass or harm specific people or groups.
        applies_to_all: it applies to all aspects of the Service
        blocking: blocking
        definition: Harassment is any behavior that produces a generally hostile environment for its target. Examples include bullying, threats, and personal attacks by or towards individuals or groups of people.
        filtering: filtering
        heading: II.H. Harassment
        muting: muting
        not_allowed_and_context: Harassment is not allowed. When judging whether a specific incident or item of Content constitutes harassment and/or when determining the appropriate severity of a penalty, the Policy & Abuse committee will consider relevant context. This includes whether the behavior was repeated, targeted, difficult to avoid encountering, or related to a general pattern of harassment by an individual or a group, among other factors. Additionally, submitting repeated and/or baseless complaints, particularly those targeting a specific user or group, may be considered harassment.
        otw:

        rpf:
          heading: Real-Person Fiction (RPF)
          text: Creating RPF never constitutes harassment in and of itself. Posting works where someone dies, is subjected to slurs, or is otherwise harmed as part of the plot is usually not a violation of the Harassment Policy. However, deliberately posting such Content in a manner designed to be seen by the subject of the work, such as by gifting them the work, may result in a judgment of harassment.
        threatening_versus_annoying_html: In general, threatening Content will be considered harassment, while Content that is merely rude or annoying will be allowed. Not everyone agrees about what is offensive and unacceptable. Users are encouraged to use tools such as %{blocking_link}, %{muting_link}, and %{filtering_link} to control their own environment on AO3.

Tags entered into mandatory fields must meet the %{minimum_criteria_link} described in the TOS FAQ.
        applying_nonspecific_tag_html: Applying a non-specific tag (such as "Not Rated", "Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings", or "Unspecified Fandom") is always considered sufficient tagging for that field. A Work that is labeled with a non-specific Rating may contain Content of the highest rating. A Work that is labeled with a non-specific Archive Warning may contain Content pertaining to %{any_archive_warning_link}.
        archive_warning: Archive Warning

In such cases, AO3 administrators may remove inaccurate tags; add non-specific tags to the Work; add specific tags to the Work in fields where non-specific tags are %{not_available_link}; require the creator to appropriately adjust the Work's tags; hide the Work; or take other appropriate action to address the matter. Refer to the %{tos_faq_link} for details about when AO3 administrators may enforce the presence or removal of tags in mandatory fields.

However, if the Content is not attached to an account you control, you may be unable to delete that Content. Although removed Content will not be publicly available through AO3, we may retain backup copies for longer periods for legal and disaster recovery purposes. These copies may be accessible to AO3 and OTW administrators. If you delete Content from AO3 or edit Content in a manner that overwrites Content that you had previously submitted, we cannot restore it at your request.
        modifying_or_adapting: Modifying or adapting
        no_copyright_ownership_html: The OTW does not claim any copyright in or ownership of your Content. %{we_repeat} Nothing in this agreement changes that in any way. However, running AO3 requires us to make copies, and backup copies, on servers that may be located anywhere around the world.

      fix_associations:
        description: Try to delete invalid associations involving this tag (e.g., parents of the wrong type, children of the wrong type, duplicate parents/children/metatags/subtags, etc.). Most of these impossible relationships appear on tag landing pages.
        title: Fix Tag Associations
      fix_counts:
        description: Try to recalculate some counts associated with this tag (both filter counts and taggings counts). Keep in mind that the tag counts listed in the fandom lists include unrevealed works and drafts, so if the count is only a little off it may just be unrevealed works or drafts.
        title: Fix Tag Counts
      fix_meta_tags:
        description: Try to recalculate inherited metatags. Use this option if this tag has grandparent metatags (i.e., a metatag with its own metatag), and the works aren't showing up in the grandparent's listing. You might also try this if you've removed a metatag, but the works are still showing up in the former metatag's listing. If the works still don't go away, ask a staffer to run "Update Tag Filters" on this tag.

      reindex_tag:
        description: Reindex this tag and all related works, bookmarks, series, pseuds, and external works. Use this option if none of the others have worked. It will not fix autocomplete issues.
        title: Reindex Tag
      reindex_work:
        description: Send in this work to be reindexed. Use this option if the work isn't appearing in searches, or is appearing in searches that it shouldn't. (e.g. If someone has orphaned their work and it can still be found with the old name, or if it's not behaving as expected when you filter crossovers, completion status, word count, etc.)
        title: Reindex Work
      update_tag_filters:
        description: Recalculate filters for all works directly tagged with this tag or one of its synonyms. Does not include subtags. Use this option if the filters include old canonical tags that have been renamed or old parent tags that works aren't tagged with, or if the tag counts are wildly off. Also use this option if the works from a synonym are not showing on the works page of the canonical within a half hour of the tag being synned. Keep in mind that the tags listed in the filters will never be 100% correct.
        title: Update Tag Filters
      update_work_filters:
        description: Recalculate the filters for this work based on the current set of tags. Use this option if wrangling seems to have gone wrong. (e.g. If you synned one of this work's tags to a canonical but it's not showing up in the tag listings, or if the wrong tags are listed in the sidebar when you drill down to a search that includes only this work.)
