        description: Try to recalculate inherited metatags. Use this option if this tag has grandparent metatags (i.e., a metatag with its own metatag), and the works aren't showing up in the grandparent's listing. You might also try this if you've removed a metatag, but the works are still showing up in the former metatag's listing. If the works still don't go away, ask a staffer to run "Update Tag Filters" on this tag.

      reindex_tag:
        description: Reindex this tag and all related works, bookmarks, series, pseuds, and external works. Use this option if none of the others have worked. It will not fix autocomplete issues.
        title: Reindex Tag
      reindex_work:
        description: Send in this work to be reindexed. Use this option if the work isn't appearing in searches, or is appearing in searches that it shouldn't. (e.g. If someone has orphaned their work and it can still be found with the old name, or if it's not behaving as expected when you filter crossovers, completion status, word count, etc.)

      update_tag_filters:
        description: Recalculate filters for all works directly tagged with this tag or one of its synonyms. Does not include subtags. Use this option if the filters include old canonical tags that have been renamed or old parent tags that works aren't tagged with, or if the tag counts are wildly off. Also use this option if the works from a synonym are not showing on the works page of the canonical within a half hour of the tag being synned. Keep in mind that the tags listed in the filters will never be 100% correct.

      update_work_filters:
        description: Recalculate the filters for this work based on the current set of tags. Use this option if wrangling seems to have gone wrong. (e.g. If you synned one of this work's tags to a canonical but it's not showing up in the tag listings, or if the wrong tags are listed in the sidebar when you drill down to a search that includes only this work.)
