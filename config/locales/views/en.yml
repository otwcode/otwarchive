(e.g. If you synned one of this work's tags to a canonical but it's not showing up in the tag listings, or if the wrong tags are listed in the sidebar when you drill down to a search that includes only this work.)"

        description: "Send in this work to be reindexed. Use this option if the work isn't appearing in searches, or is appearing in searches that it shouldn't.

      update_tag_filters:
        title: "Update Tag Filters"
        description: "Recalculate filters for all works directly tagged with this tag or one of its synonyms. Does not include subtags. Use this option if the filters include old canonical tags that have been renamed or old parent tags that works aren't tagged with, or if the tag counts are wildly off. Also use this option if the works from a synonym are not showing on the works page of the canonical within a half hour of the tag being synned. Keep in mind that the tags listed in the filters will never be 100% correct."
      reindex_tag:
        title: "Reindex Tag"

        description: "Try to recalculate some counts associated with this tag (both filter counts and taggings counts). Keep in mind that the tag counts listed in the fandom lists include unrevealed works and drafts, so if the count is only a little off it may just be unrevealed works or drafts."
      fix_associations:
        title: "Fix Tag Associations"
        description: "Try to delete invalid associations involving this tag (e.g., parents of the wrong type, children of the wrong type, duplicate parents/children/metatags/subtags, etc.). Most of these impossible relationships appear on tag landing pages."
      fix_meta_tags:
        title: "Fix Metatags"
        description: "Try to recalculate inherited metatags. Use this option if this tag has grandparent metatags (i.e., a metatag with its own metatag), and the works aren't showing up in the grandparent's listing. You might also try this if you've removed a metatag, but the works are still showing up in the former metatag's listing. If the works still don't go away, ask a staffer to run \"Update Tag Filters\" on this tag."
