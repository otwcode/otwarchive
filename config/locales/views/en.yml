          general_info: Two-step verification, also called two-factor authentication, helps prevent other people from accessing your account even if they know your password. All you need to set it up is an authenticator app such as 1Password, Google Authenticator, or Twilio Authy.

          instructions: Use your authenticator app to scan the QR code or enter the manual setup key. The app will give you a 6-digit code, which you'll use in the next step.

      site_skins_basics: A site skin lets you customize your browsing experience when you are logged in to your account. Don't like the Archive fonts? You can change them! Don't like the red header? Swap it out for blue! When you make a site skin, keep in mind that you are only changing the Archive for yourself -- other Archive users will see the Archive in whatever skin they are using. In other words, site skins are useful for creating your own ideal browsing experience, not for changing the way a work appears for others.
      work_skins_basics_html: A work skin lets you change the way one or more of your works appears to others. Work skins will %{only_bold} affect the body of the work -- that is, you can't change what the Archive navigation or background look like for someone else. What you can do, however, is create your own classes. For instance, you can change the color of some of your text, or indent some paragraphs in a particular way, and so on.

        description_html: You can specify colors using hex values (eg, %{black_hex_code} is black in hex) or with RGB or RGBA values (e.g., %{black_rgb_code} and %{black_rgba_code} both give you black). This may be safer since not all browsers will necessarily support all color names. However, color names are more readable and easier to remember, so we also allow color names. (We suggest you stick to %{common_color_names_link}.)

          availability_html: Custom properties and the %{var_code} function are only available for site skins, and won't work on work skins.
          names: Custom property names can contain any combination of lowercase letters (a-z) in the English alphabet, numerals zero to nine (0-9), dashes (-), and underscores (_). They can't contain single (') or double (") quotation marks, or URLs. Any uppercase letters (A-Z) will be converted to lowercase.

          font_names_html: In the %{font_family_code} property, we allow you to specify any font with an alphanumeric name. You can (but don't have to) specify the name with single or double quotes around it, just make sure the quotes match. (e.g., 'Gill Sans' and "Gill Sans" are both fine; 'Gill Sans" won't work.) Keep in mind that a font has to be installed on the user's operating system to work. It's a good idea when specifying fonts to use fallbacks in case your first-choice font isn't available. See %{web_safe_fonts_link}.
          no_font_face_html: We %{cannot_bold} allow the %{font_face_code} attribute. Sorry! If you have an uncommon font that you want to use in a skin you would like to share, we suggest adding a comment in the skin's "Description" field with a pointer to a place for users to download the font themselves, and using web-safe fonts as fallbacks.
          separate_properties_html: Unfortunately, you cannot use the %{font_code} shorthand in your CSS. All font properties have to be specified separately, e.g., %{font_properties_css_code}

      layering_html: You can combine and layer multiple site skins by making one the parent of another. Parent skins are loaded in order so that the style of all the skins can be displayed in that order. For more information on skins, please refer to %{skins_interface_faq_link}.

This option is only available when you select "replace archive skin entirely" from the "What it does" menu. After that, you can edit your skin and delete just the ones you don't want. This will be easier if you are using nearly all of them, since there are a lot!

      harassment:
        advocating_harm:
          heading: Advocating Harm
          text: Content that advocates specific, real, harmful actions towards real people is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, directing death threats or slurs at people outside of fiction, as well as encouraging others to harass or harm specific people or groups.
        applies_to_all: it applies to all aspects of the Service
        blocking: blocking
        definition: Harassment is any behavior that produces a generally hostile environment for its target. Examples include bullying, threats, and personal attacks by or towards individuals or groups of people.
        filtering: filtering
        heading: II.H. Harassment
        muting: muting
        not_allowed_and_context: Harassment is not allowed. When judging whether a specific incident or item of Content constitutes harassment and/or when determining the appropriate severity of a penalty, the Policy & Abuse committee will consider relevant context. This includes whether the behavior was repeated, targeted, difficult to avoid encountering, or related to a general pattern of harassment by an individual or a group, among other factors. Additionally, submitting repeated and/or baseless complaints, particularly those targeting a specific user or group, may be considered harassment.

        rpf:

          text: Creating RPF never constitutes harassment in and of itself. Posting works where someone dies, is subjected to slurs, or is otherwise harmed as part of the plot is usually not a violation of the Harassment Policy. However, deliberately posting such Content in a manner designed to be seen by the subject of the work, such as by gifting them the work, may result in a judgment of harassment.
        threatening_versus_annoying_html: In general, threatening Content will be considered harassment, while Content that is merely rude or annoying will be allowed. Not everyone agrees about what is offensive and unacceptable. Users are encouraged to use tools such as %{blocking_link}, %{muting_link}, and %{filtering_link} to control their own environment on AO3.

        applying_nonspecific_tag_html: Applying a non-specific tag (such as "Not Rated", "Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings", or "Unspecified Fandom") is always considered sufficient tagging for that field.

In such cases, AO3 administrators may remove inaccurate tags; add non-specific tags to the Work; add specific tags to the Work in fields where non-specific tags are %{not_available_link}; require the creator to appropriately adjust the Work's tags; hide the Work; or take other appropriate action to address the matter.

However, if the Content is not attached to an account you control, you may be unable to delete that Content. Although removed Content will not be publicly available through AO3, we may retain backup copies for longer periods for legal and disaster recovery purposes.

If you delete Content from AO3 or edit Content in a manner that overwrites Content that you had previously submitted, we cannot restore it at your request.

      fix_counts:
        description: Try to recalculate some counts associated with this tag (both filter counts and taggings counts). Keep in mind that the tag counts listed in the fandom lists include unrevealed works and drafts, so if the count is only a little off it may just be unrevealed works or drafts.

      fix_meta_tags:
        description: Try to recalculate inherited metatags. Use this option if this tag has grandparent metatags (i.e., a metatag with its own metatag), and the works aren't showing up in the grandparent's listing. You might also try this if you've removed a metatag, but the works are still showing up in the former metatag's listing. If the works still don't go away, ask a staffer to run "Update Tag Filters" on this tag.

      reindex_work:
        description: Send in this work to be reindexed. Use this option if the work isn't appearing in searches, or is appearing in searches that it shouldn't. (e.g. If someone has orphaned their work and it can still be found with the old name, or if it's not behaving as expected when you filter crossovers, completion status, word count, etc.)

      update_tag_filters:
        description: Recalculate filters for all works directly tagged with this tag or one of its synonyms. Does not include subtags. Use this option if the filters include old canonical tags that have been renamed or old parent tags that works aren't tagged with, or if the tag counts are wildly off. Also use this option if the works from a synonym are not showing on the works page of the canonical within a half hour of the tag being synned. Keep in mind that the tags listed in the filters will never be 100% correct.
        title: Update Tag Filters
      update_work_filters:
        description: Recalculate the filters for this work based on the current set of tags. Use this option if wrangling seems to have gone wrong. (e.g. If you synned one of this work's tags to a canonical but it's not showing up in the tag listings, or if the wrong tags are listed in the sidebar when you drill down to a search that includes only this work.)
