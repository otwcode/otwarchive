(e.g. If the tag works list is missing works tagged with a synonym, or if the tags listed in the sidebar are extremely wrong. Keep in mind that the tags listed in the sidebar will never be 100% correct, but if there's a non-canonical tag listed, or if the count is off by an order of magnitude, you should probably use this option.)"

        description: "Try to recalculate inherited metatags. Use this option if this tag has grandparent metatags (i.e. a metatag with its own metatag), and the works aren't showing up in the grandparent's listing. You might also try this if you've removed a metatag, but the works are still showing up in the former metatag's listing."
