In the event of catastrophe, the default locale files can be restored to their
original state with a [manual install from rails-i18n](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n#manual-installation).
These files should not be edited.

We are currently using the locale files from rails-i18n version 6.0.0.
