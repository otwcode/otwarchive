In the event of catastrophe, the default locale files can be restored to their
original state with a [manual install from rails-i18n](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n#manual-installation).

When restoring or updating, mr-IN and tl should be renamed mr and fil
respectively.

The contents of these default locale files should not be edited.

We are currently using the files from rails-i18n version 6.0.0.
