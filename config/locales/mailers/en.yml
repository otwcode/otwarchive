          them! Please just %{open_doors_link} and we will sort it out.
        part4: Depending on the archive, your works may have been imported restricted

        part7: If these works do belong to you, but you don't want them, you can orphan
          (so that they remain on the AO3, but with your name removed) or delete them
          (so that they are entirely removed from the AO3). You do not need to add
          these works to any account in order to orphan or delete them--you can do
          this directly from the claim link above. (For assistance, please %{support_link}.)
        part9: If you would like Open Doors to update the redirect to point to your
          pre-existing work, please delete the imported copy, and %{open_doors_link}
          with your AO3 account name, your account name on the imported archive, and
          the title and URL of the fanwork you would like the redirect to point to.

        the announcement post for your archive to be sure). If you've already uploaded
        a copy of these works and you did NOT use the import from URL feature, there
        will be two copies of the same work on the archive.
