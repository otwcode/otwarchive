      redirects: To preserve rec lists and bookmarks, the imported archive's web addresses may redirect to the imported copy of these works for a limited time (check the announcement post for your archive to be sure). If you've already uploaded a copy of these works and you did NOT use the import from URL feature, there will be two copies of the same work on the archive.

      unwanted:
        html: If these works do belong to you, but you don't want them, you can orphan (so that they remain on the AO3, but with your name removed) or delete them (so that they are entirely removed from the AO3). You do not need to add these works to any account in order to orphan or delete them--you can do this directly from the claim link above. (For assistance, please %{contact_support_link}.)
