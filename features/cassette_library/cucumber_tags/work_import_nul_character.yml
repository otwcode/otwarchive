      "Whoops?" says Kon. "Yeah, that'd kind of explain why I'm in your lap now, wouldn't it."<br />
      <br />
      Not-Bart thumps the forcefield again, and yep, looks like Dox Sr. was right, because the box gives them a little shove and Inertia is pushed off his big feet and sprawls across Kon.<br />

She isn't... Why would they not tell her? She's lying so still, and has tubes, down her throat and up her nose, and she can't even turn her head. Cass prowls around the bed. Barbara is dreaming about something. Not something happy, or sad, not a memory, but a dream of doing, but Cass can't tell what.<br />
      <br />
      The room is dark, and Barbara is alone with the machines.<br />
      <br />
      That isn't right. Cass carefully climbs in next to Barbara, and matches her own breathing to Barbara's. Barbara will get better. She has to.

      Slobo shifts around on the seat cushion. "Only, I like to ogle woman flesh, is all."<br />

      <br />
      Lobo growls, but takes off her shoes.

They have cool days, but those are the days the fog carries in the smell from the harbour. They have clear days, but those are the days that the air is biting cold. The sky is never this colour, and barring some criminal act of Ivy, there's never this much greenery. Tim doesn't let himself become accustomed to the world outside Gotham. There's no point.<br />
      <br />
      Connor grins. "Ah, no. Not like that, you'll waste most of force of the string on your wrist. Out a little more."<br />
      <br />
      Tim tries to adjust it. "Like this?" Like so many things that looks simple, the trick is mostly skill and practise. A lot of both.<br />
      <br />
      "Uh, yeah. Except. Here." Conner steps up behind him and adjusts his Tim's left wrist and right elbow. "Like this," he says in Tim's ear. There's a certain temptation to prolong the moment.<br />
      <br />
      Tim releases the string, and strides toward the target. There's no point in becoming accustomed.<p align="right"><a href="#top"><I>Back to Index</i></a></p><p class="chaptertitle"><a name="5"></a><h4 align="center">Chapter 6: non-con snuggle challenge</h4></p>"You're kind of a dick," says Wally and pulls a little ahead<br />

      Bart strains, and adds more speed, "You'd be the expert on that."<br />
      <br />
      "You're nicer when you're younger," says Wally a little wistfully, and everything's stretching now, and he's starting to feel a blur in the boundaries of his body that means they're close.<br />
      <br />
      Aggravatingly, Bart is pulling ahead. "Nah, just more polite. I had wierd ideas about respecting my elders."<br />
      <br />
      Wally stops thinking about running and just concentrates on *speed.* When you're going this fast, running is just a mental construct. "Is this going to work?"<br />
      <br />
      "Let's pretend it will, since it's our only chance."<br />
      <br />
      And when they hit the speed force together, for a moment there's no physical boundaries, just a tangle of selves, two souls pressed together by the ludicrous energies poured into them.<br />
      <br />
      Then there's a pop, and Wally's back on his front door step, which is no longer a Speakeasy, and Linda isn't dressed like Xena Warrior Princess, so it looks like it worked.<p align="right"><a href="#top"><I>Back to Index</i></a></p><p class="chaptertitle"><a name="6"></a><h4 align="center">Chapter 7: non-con snuggle challenge</h4></p>"Okay.

      "God, do you even eat?" she hisses, with very little regard for their continued concealment. "I can feel your hipbone."<br />

      Dick tries to guess the number of armed men by their sound. Go away, he tells them mentally.<br />

      "Oh, God," says Helena. "Please tell me that is your hipbone."<br />

      The nice thing about Cass is you never have to explain when you don't know what she's talking about.<br />

      <br />
      "I have a chemical heat pack," he offers.<br />

      Cass blows out frustration, gets up, shakes out her skirt, and carefully sits across Tim's lap. She seems to be waiting for his reaction.<br />
      <br />
      "Um." he says.<br />
      <br />
      She makes a sound like a kitten attempting to growl, grabs his arm, and pulls it across her waist, and then does the same with the other one. "Like this," she informs him, and then puts her cheek against his lapel.<br />

      <br />
      "I prefer the ambiguity of 'mad,'" says Red Hood. "This building's going to collapse soon, you know."<br />

      "I'm pretty sure I'm not required to let you stab me," says Dick uncertainly. "I know the one about the scorpion and the frog."<br />

      Dick huffs through his nose. "Spread."<br />

      Jay complies. "Is it like the reverse cowgirl? I know that one."<br />

      Dick pats Jason down and removes about eight pounds of weaponry. "At least you'll be lighter," he says, and then shoots the hook. It catches.<br />
      <br />
      Dick's expecting Jason to just grab him around the waist, but instead he grabs Dick in a hug, and climbs him, locking his ankles in the small of his back. "Bruce would come in his bat-jock if he could see us," he says in Dick's ear.<br />

      "Your ankle is on top of mine, Bart," says Cissie.<br />

      Bart strains. "It's hooked over your foot. I don't think I can-- Oh good, Cassie!"<br />
      <br />
      Cassie walks in with Kon slung over her shoulder. "It's not super strength," Kon is explaining, "it's tactile telekinesis."<br />
      <br />
      "There any more room on the mat?" asks Cassie? "Superboy needs to lie down."<br />
      <br />
      "Hey!" Kon protests. "I weigh, like, five hundred pounds."<br />
      <br />
      "Seven hundred and ninety-five, mon, unless you been lying about your weight."<br />
      <br />
      Cassie gently shoves everyone around to make room for Kon, and unhooks Bart's ankle while she's at it. "I think I'll put you next to Robin."<br />
      <br />
      "T'ank you," says Anita.<br />

      Cassie shudders. "Not soon enough for me!"<br />

      "We're masking each others' bio-signatures from Braniac Twelve," says Batman in a way that kind makes him feel that the conversational gambit was maybe... unwelcome. The green guy ignores him, watching over Batman's shoulder as he solders.<br />

      The green guy's probably easier to talk to. "Cool. So. Are you, uh. Martian?"<br />

Bart is all instinct, all heart, all trust, and all of these leave him so open. Max knows it's his duty and responsibility to toughen the boy up and sometimes he can't bear it.<br />
      <br />
      Like now, when Bart is so clearly miserable and, uncharacteristically, untalkative. He mopes around the house at barely four or five times normal speed. He goes out with Carol, but only when she comes knocking, otherwise he stays home. He'll run with Max, but only when Max suggests it. Max is on the verge of asking Morlo to rig up some kind of perverse crime just to see if that will snap Bart out of it.<br />
      <br />
      But of course, before he can really persuade himself of the wisdom of this idea, Bart finishes whatever mood he was working on, or at least the untalkative portion. He flops down on the couch beside Max and sighs.<br />

      Max makes a vaguely inquisitive without being especially interested noise, a speciality of his.<br />

      <br />
      "People. Life." Bart sighs again, and leans against Max's shoulder.<br />
      <br />
      Max doesn't really remember being that young, or that wise. Or possibly he's just a foolish and sentimental old man. "No Bart. In fact, it seems to get harder. The older you grow, the more mistakes you discover to make."<br />

      "That sucks para demon toes."<br />

      Max puts his arm over Bart's shoulder, and pulls him in. For 2.23 seconds objective, Bart puts an arm up, and hides his face in Max's shirt. Then he bounces up and says, "What happens if you put silly putty in the microwave?"<br />
