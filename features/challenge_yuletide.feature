Feature: Collection
  I want to test Yuletide, because it has several specific settings that are different from an ordinary gift exchange

  # uncomment this and the other 'javascript' lines below when testing on local
  # in order to test javascript-based features
  #@javascript
  Scenario: Create a Yuletide gift exchange, sign up for it, run matching, post, fulfil pinch hits

  Given the following activated users exist
    | login          | password    |
    | mod1           | something   |

    | myname3        | something   |
    | myname4        | something   |
    | pinchhitter    | password    |
    And I am logged in as "mod1" with password "something"
    And I have Yuletide challenge tags setup
    And I have no challenge assignments
    And I add the fandom "Stargate Atlantis" to the character "John Sheppard"
