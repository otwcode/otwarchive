  As a reader

  Scenario: Subscribe to a test fandom when there are no works in it

  When I am logged in as "reader"
    And I view the "F/F" works index
  Then I should see "Subscribe to the feed"
  # TODO: If you uncomment the next line, it fails horribly. Is this a genuine bug, or a cucumber error?
  # When I follow "Subscribe to the feed"
  # Then I should not see "My Work Title"
  #   And I should not see "Stargate SG-1"
