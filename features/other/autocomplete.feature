Feature: Display autocomplete for tags
  In order to facilitate posting
  I should be getting autocompletes for my tags

Scenario: Only matching canonical tags should appear in autocomplete, and searching for the same data twice should produce same results
	Given I am logged in
		And a set of tags for testing autocomplete
   	And I go to the new work page
  Then the tag autocomplete fields should list only matching canonical tags
  
Scenario: For fandom-specific autocomplete, if a fandom is entered then only characters/relationships within the fandom should appear in autocomplete
	Given I am logged in
		And a set of tags for testing autocomplete
 		And I go to the new work page
 	Then the fandom-specific tag autocomplete fields should list only fandom-specific canonical tags

Scenario: Bookmark archive work form autocomplete should work
  Given I am logged in
    And a set of tags for testing autocomplete
  When I start a new bookmark
    And I enter text in the "Your Tags" autocomplete field
  Then I should only see matching canonical tags in the autocomplete

Scenario: Bookmark external work form autocomplete should work
  Given I am logged in
    And a set of tags for testing autocomplete
    And an external work    
  When I go to the new external work page
  Then the tag autocomplete fields should list only matching canonical tags
    And the fandom-specific tag autocomplete fields should list only fandom-specific canonical tags
    And the external url autocomplete field should list the urls of existing external works

Scenario: Pseud and collection autocompletes should work
  Given I am logged in
	  And a set of collections for testing autocomplete
  	And a set of users for testing autocomplete
   	And I go to the new work page
  Then the coauthor autocomplete field should list matching users
    And the gift recipient autocomplete field should list matching users
    And the collection item autocomplete field should list matching collections

Scenario: Collection autocomplete shows Collection Title and Name
  Given I have the collection "Issue" with name "jb_fletcher"
    And I have the collection "Issue" with name "robert_stack"
    And I am logged in as "Scott" with password "password"
    And I post the work "All The Nice Things"
    And I view the work "All The Nice Things"
    And I follow "Add To Collections"
    And I fill in "collection_names" with "Issue"
  Then I should see "jb_fletcher" in the autocomplete
    And I should see "robert_stack" in the autocomplete
