Feature: Search Works
  In order to test search
  As a humble coder
  I have to use cucumber with thinking sphinx
  
  Scenario: first check the errors for an invalid search
  
  When I am on the homepage
    And I fill in "site_search" with "Tag: harry potter Words: >1000 (Language: Deutsch | Tag: Deutsch)"
    And I press "Search"
  Then I should see "bad words format (ignored)"
    And I should see "0 Found"

  # do everything that doesn't modify the works in one scenario
  # so you only have to load the fixtures and update the sphinx indexes once
  Scenario: Search works
    Given I have loaded the fixtures
      And the work indexes are updated

    # do some valid searches
