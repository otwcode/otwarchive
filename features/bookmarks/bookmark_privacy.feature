Feature: Private bookmarks
  In order to have an archive full of bookmarks
  As a humble user
  I want to bookmark some works privately
      
  Scenario: private bookmarks on public and restricted works
# TODO
# check their visibility on a tag's bookmarks
# private bookmarks should also not increase a bookmark's counter

    Given the following activated users exist
      | login           | password   |
      | workauthor      | password   |
      | bookmarker      | password   |
      | otheruser       | password   |
      And a fandom exists with name: "Stargate SG-1", canonical: true
      And I am logged in as "workauthor" with password "password"
      And I post the locked work "Secret Masterpiece"
      And I post the work "Public Masterpiece"
    When I log out
      And I am logged in as "bookmarker" with password "password"
      And I view the work "Secret Masterpiece"
      And I follow "Bookmark"
      And I check "bookmark_rec"
      And I check "bookmark_private"
      And I press "Create"
    Then I should see "Bookmark was successfully created"
      And I should see the "title" text "Restricted"
      And I should not see "Rec"
      And I should see "Private Bookmark"
      And I should see "0"
