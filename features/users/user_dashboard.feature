Feature: User dashboard
  In order to have an archive full of users
  As a humble user
  I want to write some works and see my dashboard
    
  Scenario: Fandoms on user dashboard
  
  Given the following activated users exist
    | login           | password   |
    | bookmarkuser1   | password   |
    | bookmarkuser2   | password   |
  Given the following activated tag wrangler exists
    | login  | password    |
    | Enigel | wrangulate! |
    
  # set up metatag and synonym
    
  When I am logged in as "Enigel" with password "wrangulate!"
    And a fandom exists with name: "Stargate SG-1", canonical: true
    And a fandom exists with name: "Stargatte SG-oops", canonical: false
    And a fandom exists with name: "Stargate Franchise", canonical: true
    And I edit the tag "Stargate SG-1"
    And I fill in "MetaTags" with "Stargate Franchise"
    And I press "Save changes"
  Then I should see "Tag was updated"
  When I edit the tag "Stargatte SG-oops"
    And I fill in "Synonym" with "Stargate SG-1"
    And I press "Save changes"
  Then I should see "Tag was updated"
  
  # view user dashboard - when posting a work with the canonical, metatag and synonym should not be seen
  
  When I log out
  Then I should see "Sorry, you don't have permission to access the page you were trying to reach. Please log in."
    
  When I am logged in as "bookmarkuser1" with password "password"
  Then I should see "Hi, bookmarkuser1!"
  When I go to bookmarkuser2's user page
  Then I should see "There are no works or bookmarks under this name yet"
  When I go to bookmarkuser1's user page
  Then I should see "Dashboard"
    And I should see "You don't have anything posted under this name yet"
    And I should not see "Revenge of the Sith"
    And I should not see "Stargate"
  When I am logged in as "bookmarkuser2" with password "password"
    And I post the work "Revenge of the Sith"
  When I go to the bookmarks page
  Then I should not see "Revenge of the Sith"
  When I go to bookmarkuser2's user page
  Then I should see "Stargate"
    And I should see "SG-1" within "#user-fandoms"
    And I should not see "Stargate Franchise"
    And I should not see "Stargatte SG-oops"
    
  # now using the synonym - canonical should be seen, but metatag still not seen
  
  When I edit the work "Revenge of the Sith"
    And I fill in "Fandoms" with "Stargatte SG-oops"
    And I press "Preview"
    And I press "Update"
  Then I should see "Work was successfully updated"
  When I go to bookmarkuser2's user page
  Then I should see "Stargate"
    And I should see "SG-1" within "#user-fandoms"
    And I should not see "Stargate Franchise"
    And I should not see "Stargatte SG-oops" within "#user-fandoms"
    And I should see "Stargatte SG-oops"

  Scenario: When a user has more works, series, or bookmarks than the maximum displayed on dashboards (5), the "Recent" listbox for that type of item should contain a link to that user's page for that type of item (e.g. Works (6), Bookmarks (10)). The link should go to the user's works, series, or bookmarks page. That link should not exist for any pseuds belonging to that user until the pseud has 5 or more works/series/bookmarks, and then the pseud's link should go to the works/series/bookmarks page for that pseud.
