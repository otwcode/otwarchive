Feature: Page titles
When I browse the AO3
I want page titles to be readable

Background:

  Given the app name is "Example Archive"

Scenario: An index page uses only the controller name in the default browser page title

  Given a fandom exists with name: "No Fandom", canonical: true
  When I go to the tags page
  Then I should see the page title "Tags | Example Archive"

Scenario: A non-index page uses the action and controller names in the default browser page title

  When I am logged in as "user"
    And I go to the new work page
  Then I should see the page title "New Work | Example Archive"

  When I go to the TOS page
  Then the page title should include "Terms of Service | Example Archive"
