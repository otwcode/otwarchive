Feature: Filters
  In order to ensure filtering works on works and bookmarks
  As a humble user
  I want to filter on a user's works and bookmarks

  Background:
    Given a fandom exists with name: "The Hobbit", canonical: true
      And a fandom exists with name: "Harry Potter", canonical: true
      And a fandom exists with name: "Legend of Korra", canonical: true
      And I am logged in as "meatloaf"
      And meatloaf can use the new search
      And I post the work "A Hobbit's Meandering" with fandom "The Hobbit"
      And I post the work "Bilbo Does the Thing" with fandom "The Hobbit, Legend of Korra"
      And I post the work "Roonal Woozlib and the Ferrets of Nimh" with fandom "Harry Potter"

  @javascript
