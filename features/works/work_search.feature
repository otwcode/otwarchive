Feature: Search Works
  In order to test search
  As a humble coder
  I have to use cucumber with thinking sphinx
  
  # do everything that doesn't modify the works in one scenario
  # so you only have to load the fixtures and update the sphinx indexes once
  Scenario: Search works
    Given I have loaded the fixtures
      And I have Battle 12 prompt meme fully set up
      And everyone has signed up for Battle 12
    When mod fulfills claim
    When I reveal the "Battle 12" challenge
    When I am logged in as "myname4"
      And the work indexes are updated
      
    # anon work doesn't show up in searches
    When I search for works containing "mod"
    Then I should see "No results found"
    When I search for works by mod
    Then I should see "No results found"
    
    # reveal works
    When I reveal the authors of the "Battle 12" challenge
    When all search indexes are updated
    When I am logged in as "myname4"
    When I search for works containing "mod"
    Then I should see "No results found"
    When I search for works by mod
    Then I should see "No results found"
