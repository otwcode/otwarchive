    Then I should see "Copy and paste the following code to link back to this work"
      And I should see "or use the Tweet or Tumblr links to share the work"
      And I should see "><strong>Blabla</strong></a> (6 words) b"
      And I should see "by <a href="
      And I should see 'Fandom: <a href="http://www.example.com/tags/Stargate' within "#share"
      And I should see "Rating: Not Rated" within "#share"
      And I should see "Warnings: No Archive Warnings Apply" within "#share"
      And I should see "Tweet" within "a.twitter-share-button"
      And I should see "Share on Tumblr" within "div#share ul li a[title]"
