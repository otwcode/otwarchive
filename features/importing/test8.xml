          Ron Weasley was frustrated and angry. The one girl he really cared about, and might even be in love with was still exchanging letters with that stupid Bulgarian git. Hed stormed out of the 6th years dormitory, barefoot and in his pajamas, looking for an empty classroom where he could vent his frustration without the rest of his dormmates knowing what his problem was. He took the steps up the south tower two at a time and peeked into the closest classroom, finding it completely deserted.

          He entered the room and slammed his fist into the wall. . All I ever wanted was for Hermione to notice me, the real me, not the boy that she first saw on the train with dirt on his nose! Ron snarled to the empty room as he shook his stinging fist to ease the pain. Continuing to mutter out loud, he paced the aisles of desks, I dont know what else to do. Why would she ever be interested in me anyways? Lost in his diatribe, he never heard the sound of the classroom door opening.

          Ron what iz troubling you? a soft voice called out from behind him, causing Ron to whip around staring in stunned disbelief at the sight before him. Fleur Delacour clad only in a light dressing down , was standing there looking amused by his mutterings.

          Nothing, its really nothing. Ron whispered; feeling his ears turning red and wishing desperately that blushing wasnt the curse of a red head.

          It iz not nothing. Fleur smiled and closed the distance between them. You are longing for someone no? she whispered and he couldnt help his body reacting to her nearness.

          You could say that. He responded grudgingly, letting his eyes trail over her features. They traced over the long silvery hair that flowed down her shoulder, and he could just make out the swell of her breasts beneath her dressing gown.

          It iz ermione iz it not? Fleur smiled, you ave only one problem. Self confidence.

          Why would she want me? Im nothing, Im no Viktor Krum. Ron was angry for proving her right. He hadnt meant to say it, it just spilled from his lips.

          Ron I can, how do you say? Elp you? Fleur whispered and he felt her eyes drift over his body. Her intense gaze caused him to shuffle nervously back and forth. Would you like me to elp you Ronald? she whispered softly, stepping closer to him and raised her hand to his face. I can give you the confidence you need. After all you elped to save Gabrielle.

          How can you help me? Ron whispered feeling his pajamas tighten across his rapidly arising erection.

          I can show you how to please a woman. Fleur answered standing on tiptoe to place a soft kiss at the corner of his mouth, I will give you one night.

          Hermione. Ron whispered, shed find out, she always finds out. His hands unconsciously fell to her waist and pulled her closer to his body.

          You can oblivate me after. Fleur whispered as she trailed her mouth along his jaw to his ear. Ron felt himself harden further as she began pushing him backwards towards the cupboard on the other side of the room.

          Ron it will be one random night. How do you say? A lesson, she whispered before capturing his mouth in a kiss designed to arouse, and tease.

          Ron felt the last of his resistance break and he slid his tongue into her mouth, groaning as it slid along side of hers. He fumbled behind him, looking for the doorknob. The door swung open and he lifted his mouth from hers and pulled her inside.

          Fleur muttered a silencing charm and smiled, Ron the first ting you need to learn iz how to take off a womans clothes. She took his hands and raised them to the knot of her dressing gown. Untie it slowly.

          Ron felt his whole body tremble in anticipation, and under her guidance slowly untied her dressing gown. He raised his hands to her shoulders and pushed it off, letting it slide to the floor. He bent his head to her shoulder and trailed kisses across her collarbone acting purely on instinct, enjoying the feel of her shivers against him.

          Now, undo my pajamas, she whispered, as she drew his mouth to hers again.
          He was surer this time and quickly undid the buttons down the front of her gown. Trapping her body against the wall he pressed against her, enjoying the feel of her body against his. Involuntarily he thrust his hips against her, in time with the movement of his tongue against hers. He was surprised to find his hands moving up her sides and reaching between them to cup her full breasts in his hands.

          Fleur groaned against his lips and pulled back slightly, Youre a quick learner. Put your mouth on me. She demanded as she slid her hands to his waist and pulled her hips against hers. Pressing her center to his erection she let out gasping moans as Ron ran his tongue across her nipple, circling it with his tongue before biting lightly with his teeth, and pulling it to a taunt point. His hand caressed her other breast, using his thumb and forefinger he rolled her nipple roughly.

          Fleur slid her hands to his arse, and pulled him tighter against her, arching her hips into his with each pull of his mouth. Rons body shook with tightly controlled need and he willed himself not to come right there when she began pushing his head down.

          I want you to taste me. Fleur moaned as he trailed kisses to the waistband of her knickers. He slid his hands to the sides and slowly pulled them down her legs.

          Ive never done this before, Ron stammered as he took in her naked form. What do I do?

          Use your tongue and mouth like youre kissing me.

          Ron slowly parted her folds and slid his finger between them. He groaned when he felt how wet she was. Hed made her this way. She was wet because of him, for him, and that knowledge gave him the power to move his head between her legs.

          Hesitantly he slid his tongue through her folds, and focused solely on pleasuring the girl gasping before him. When he found her clit with his tongue it seem to set off a chain reaction throughout her body. He heard her crying out. She was practically begging for release. Teasing her clit with just the tip of his tongue he grew bolder and slid two fingers inside her.

          Yes, right there Ronald. Im going to come! She cried out as she thrust her hips in time with the rhythm of his mouth and hands. With another loud cry he felt her convulse around his fingers and go limp and against the wall. Ron continued to taste, savoring her until she tugged at his hair, he slid his mouth up her body and claimed her lips softly as she composed herself.

          Now it iz your turn. Fleur smiled as she lowered her hands to his pajama bottoms and slid them down his hips along with his boxers. Sit down on the floor.

          Ron complied immediately, jumping as she slid her hand across his cock, she positioned her entrance over him and slowly slid down his erection until he was fully buried inside her causing them both to moan.

          She leaned forward and claimed his lips, timing the thrust of her tongue with movements that were driving Ron mad. Banging his head back against the wall he let out a desperate moan as she rode him harder, increasing her movements until she was sliding up and down his cock so hard her breasts bounced in front of him.

          Both of them were moaning continuously as she clenched around him with each downward push of her hips. Ron lost all power to think as she slid her hand down to her folds and began rubbing herself on each upward movement of her hips. Ron slid his hands to her waist trying to guide her movements. He lifted his hips and moved against her, and felt his release coming with a hot curling in his belly.

          Fleur, he moaned as she tossed her head back and letting loose with soft whimpers of need

          Iz it good Ron. Are you going to come? She whispered hoarsely as she frantically rode him, searching for the release the both needed.

          With a hoarse cry Ron let loose as he felt her muscles milking him, and he shuddered as his release overtook him. He came harder than he ever had touching himself and moaned as he heard her cry out and follow him in release. Taking a moment to regain his composure he whispered, Thank you.

          You are very velcome. Fleur replied as she rested her forehead against his. You ave nothing to worry about with ermione Ronald. Youre a natural.

          Ron was surprised he could still muster a blush after being so intimate with her. I should be getting back, he whispered, Harry will be looking for me.

          He moaned as she slid off of him, and regretted the loss of connection between them. The quickly dressed and made their way out of the classroom.

          Ronald there iz only one thing left. Fleur whispered as she met his lips in a gentle kiss, You must Obliviate me now.

          Fleur, he whispered back, isnt there another way?

          No, it was one time, a random shag. A wonderful shag but you must Obliviate me, Ron. She caressed his cheek gently as if trying to remember his features.

          Thank you. Do you really think I have a chance with Hermione? he asked earnestly before giving her a chaste kiss on the cheek.

          Ron studied her as she thought about it for a moment, I do, she loves you too Ronald. Now do it quick before I change my mind.

          Ron claimed her lip again as he reached for his wand, Obliviate! His voice was strong and sure as he cast the spell. He watched the dazed look pass over her features and quietly slipped from the room.

          Harry glanced at his watch again growing more and more nervous with each passing second that tarried Ron's arrival. They had agreed to meet in the Prefect's bathroom to go over the security measures the DA would take upon Harry's departure from the school. He agreed to return to the school to boost morale in the wizarding community and to encourage parents to send their children to the wizarding school. After Dumbledore's death the likelihood of the school opening was unlikely and had it not been for the Order adding layers of protection over the school, it was a certainty that Hogwarts would not open its doors in the Fall. But Harry knew where his destiny lay and it wasn't within the corridors of the edifice he called home for the past seven years.

          The mermaid in the portrait splashed in her picture then winked as she surfaced while Harry paced back and forth. He had wanted to leave shortly after the Welcoming Feast, but Ron had persuaded him to stay on for the night.

          "There are Order members everywhere, Ron. We dont need the DA!" he had told him on the thestral-carriage ride to the gates.

          "Did you ever think that perhaps the DA needs it?" Luna asked and Harry sighed, shoulders slumped over. He thought he caught a wink between Ron and Luna but he didn't exactly care at that moment.

          "Waiting for someone?" a breathy voice asked from somewhere above him and Harry rolled his eyes.

          "Yes and you best clear out Myrtle or I'll hex you," Ron's voice echoed in the cavernous bathroom. He was leaning against the tiled wall, his jumper sleeves rolled up to his elbows showing muscular forearms Harry could only dream of having.

          Myrtle gave a long wail before swirling down to divebomb Ron who quickly aimed his wand at her and glared at the ghost now frozen in a scream above him. "I told you to clear out and if you sneak into the pipes, I'll send the Bloody Baron to sick Peeves on you."

          He released her from the Immobilus spell and they watched her splash through the toilet before Ron turned his attention to Harry. Without saying a word, Ron tapped the door with his wand locking it and much to Harry's surprise, cast a nonverbal spell Harry hoped was a silencing spell. If they were going to discuss the DA, he didn't want to be overheard.

          "What exactly did you want the DA to what are you doing?" Harry asked, his eyes widening when Ron started to pull his jumper over his head as he toed off his trainers.

          "Taking a bath. That carriage ride always lifts all the dust into my face and I feel gritty. Keep talking, I'm listening." Ron was now undoing his zipper one-handed while turning the taps with the other. "Which do you like better, Strawberry or Raspberry bubbles?"

          "What what are you talking about Ron? I don't have time for a bath, I have to go!" And he made to walk to the door of the bathroom, his face red and his hands suddenly feeling sweaty.

          He'd gaped! How many times had they changed in the Quidditch Changing Rooms and now he gapes? Ron was standing there completely naked, his trousers long kicked aside as he bent to turn the taps and Harry had been staring at his body. He didn't need this complication and he didn't need it now. But as his thoughts continued to stray toward this dilemma, he suddenly felt himself being pulled back against his will toward the bubble-laden bath housing his best friend. A very naked and very wet best friend.

          "What are you doing?" Harry asked. Ron pushed himself up on the edge of the swimming pool-sized tub and tugged Harry into the strawberry scented water, his arms enveloping Harry's chest. He was soaked from head to toe, his robes clinging to his body much like his hair was to the top of his head.

          "Showing you what the DA needs," Ron whispered, his eyes hot and glinting in the faerie light around them.

          "A bath? The DA needs a bath?"

          "Well, what one of the DA members needs," and advancing on his best friend, Ron Weasley pinned Harry to the side of the pool, his hands on the other man's shoulders, their noses almost touching.

          "Ron? What are you" but just as he was to ask the repetitive question, Ron crashed their lips together. The kiss was unexpected and Harry couldn't think, couldn't process anything other than his best friend was kissing him. Ron Weasley was currently snogging the life out of Harry and it felt right. His kisses were fierce, their teeth clashed and when Harry cupped Ron's face and met the ginger-haired man's tongue with his own, the sounds of their moans mingled in the strawberry-scented air.

          Harry's head swam with thoughts of 'they shouldn't be doing this' mingled with those of 'to hell with everything I never want to leave his mouth ever again!' His reverie was jarred however by the feel of a very large, very masculine and very strong hand stroking him through his trousers. Their kisses grew hungrier, more needy as Ron's palm was now stroking Harry's growing erection with such ferocity Harry's hips bucked against it. He suddenly felt too clothed.

          His clothes were sensitizing his skin, the sounds of the water sloshing around him was driving him mad and Ron's lips against his Adam's apple, sucking and nibbling along his neck was spiking his lust to a level he never thought possible. His cock was now painfully jutting against his trousers and Ron did not seem to care that he was still dressed.

          "Ron," he moaned as Ron's hands found their way around his hips and were stroking his backside. "Have to get out too much need to"

          Ron pulled back, his eyes pain-filled. "Oh shit, I fucked up, didn't I?" He ran a hand through is wet ginger hair and Harry stood in the tub panting, wide-eyed, his lips still burning from the searing kisses Ron had left.

          When his head cleared slightly Harry realized what Ron was thinking. What he had deduced from his words and thinking the spell clearly in his mind, his wand clutched firmly in his right hand, he banished his own clothing then advanced on the other man.

          "No, but I wouldn't mind you fucking something else," his lips claimed Ron's and running his hands down Ron's massive chest, his fingers curled around the root of a large and thick cock he'd just recently been admiring. "Namely, me."

          Ron's resolve was lost in that moment and as they battled for dominance in the water, their bodies rubbing and colliding against each other, Harry wrapped his legs around Ron's waist and ground his hips against Ron's belly. The light trail of hair there provided the perfect friction and when Ron's middle finger breached his entrance, his groan was swallowed in Ron's kiss.

          The suds from the strawberry bubbles proved to be the perfect lubricant, it seems as Ron's fingers continued to widen him and prepare him for what Harry knew was going to be the moment their lives changed forever. Where they moved from friends to lovers and with their foreheads touching, their chests heaving from their panting, Ron begged.

          "Please Harry can I?"

          "Yes! Please you're driving me mad!"

          Removing his fingers and turning them around so that Harry's back was against the tub wall, Ron lifted Harry out of the water and gripping his erection at the base, he asked once more.

          Harry locked his ankles around Ron's waist and eased himself over that thick cock, his eyes rolling back in his head as he winced.

          "Do it god move, you're killing me!"

          Ron didn't need to be told twice. With his hands on Harry's waist he brought the raven-haired man down forcibly on his throbbing cock and their groans bounced against the tiled walls for what seemed like an eternity.

          Their bodies slapped together, the water lapping against them as Harry propped himself up on his elbows and met Ron's thrusts, his cock bobbing out of the water with each forcible thrust. It didn't take long for their climax and neither could remember today who came first but as they groaned each other's names, their seed spilt in the bathwater and their bodies remained joined through their post-coital bliss, their hearts bound together in a way that not even an Unbreakable Vow could compare.

          Harry left that day but Ron followed in the morning, seems the DA needed many more reassuring baths in the months to come. Harry was only to happy to oblige.
